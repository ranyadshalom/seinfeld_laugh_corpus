1
00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:02,329
What are lawyers really?

2
00:00:02,354 --> 00:00:04,485
To me, a lawyer is basically...

3
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,633
the person that knows
the rules of the country.

4
00:00:07,705 --> 00:00:10,069
We're all throwing the dice,
playing the game...

5
00:00:10,174 --> 00:00:13,209
moving our pieces around the
board, but if there's a problem...

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,244
the lawyer is the only person that
has read the inside top of the box.

7
00:00:18,415 --> 00:00:21,507
I think one of the fun things
for them is to say "objection."

8
00:00:21,585 --> 00:00:26,088
"Objection! Objection, Your Honor."

9
00:00:26,557 --> 00:00:30,491
"Objection," of course,
is the adult version of "afraid not."

10
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:38,100
To which the judge
can say two things:

11
00:00:38,168 --> 00:00:42,898
He can say "overruled," which
is the adult version of "afraid so."

12
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:47,676
Or he can say "sustained,"
which is the adult version of "duh."

13
00:00:53,617 --> 00:00:56,049
So... So you're a lawyer.

14
00:00:56,587 --> 00:00:58,177
What kind of cases
do you handle?

15
00:00:58,255 --> 00:01:02,314
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents,
immigration and naturalization.

16
00:01:02,593 --> 00:01:06,129
What is that? Immigrants come over,
you show them how to act natural?

17
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:10,294
Are your friends as funny as you?

18
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:14,128
No, they're not funny at all.
No. I have no funny friends.

19
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:17,330
I'm the funny one. El Clown-o.

20
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:20,309
Look, I was nice enough
to pick it up for you.

21
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:22,672
Hey, I've been back four days.
I want my mail.

22
00:01:22,746 --> 00:01:25,337
It's mostly bills, magazines
and junk mail anyway.

23
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,416
Elaine, that's what mail is.

24
00:01:27,484 --> 00:01:30,417
Without bills, magazines
and junk mail, there is no mail.

25
00:01:30,954 --> 00:01:33,352
- Here's my card.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

26
00:01:33,424 --> 00:01:35,890
- Hey, good talking to you.
- Nice meeting you.

27
00:01:38,896 --> 00:01:40,463
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

28
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:42,565
You would not believe
what just happened.

29
00:01:42,633 --> 00:01:45,827
I was waiting for you, and this woman
was sitting at the counter.

30
00:01:45,903 --> 00:01:47,561
- What, the one who just left?
- Yeah.

31
00:01:47,638 --> 00:01:49,035
And so we started talking...

32
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:51,140
and she's this lawyer,
who's incredible.

33
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,969
You know,
everything I said was funny.

34
00:01:53,043 --> 00:01:56,476
She laughed at everything I said.
She thinks I'm hilarious.

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,207
You know, in a way,
it was almost too good.

36
00:01:59,283 --> 00:02:02,875
I started so good, I can't go anyplace
but down now, you know.

37
00:02:03,253 --> 00:02:04,980
I got no place to go.

38
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,619
Yeah, well, guess it's all over.

39
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,184
Hey, is that Babu?

40
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:15,531
- It is. Hey, Babu!
- Jerry.

41
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,462
Look at you. You got the job.

42
00:02:17,534 --> 00:02:20,535
- Yes, they give me job, thanks to you.
- Oh, I didn't do anything.

43
00:02:20,604 --> 00:02:23,935
No, you do everything. Get me job,
get me place to live in your building.

44
00:02:24,007 --> 00:02:25,472
- Come on.
- You very good man.

45
00:02:25,542 --> 00:02:27,109
- Stop.
- You did everything for me.

46
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:29,575
I can never thank you enough
for everything you do.

47
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,873
You see, this is what I do
with women.

48
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:34,017
I start out too strong.

49
00:02:34,084 --> 00:02:36,982
Now I have to become real.
That's when it all falls apart.

50
00:02:37,754 --> 00:02:40,755
What good is real? They don't
want real. They want funny.

51
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,518
- No, they don't. No.
- Oh, yes, they do, Elaine.

52
00:02:43,594 --> 00:02:46,788
Oh, you gotta put on a show. You
always gotta give them a big show.

53
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:49,831
You always have to be on.
Otherwise, why would they like me?

54
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,265
They'd just go for a better-looking
guy with more money.

55
00:02:55,172 --> 00:02:56,739
You mean that's true? I'm right?

56
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:59,375
Okay, great. Well, I'm glad
everything worked out, Babu.

57
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:02,569
- Yes. Everything wonderful.
- I'll see you around the building.

58
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:04,941
I'll see you in the building.

59
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:07,815
- Remember Babu Bhatt?
- Who's he?

60
00:03:08,118 --> 00:03:10,880
Remember that guy, opened
the restaurant across the street...

61
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:13,648
from the building last year
and he wasn't doing so well?

62
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:16,052
I told him he should make it
into all-Pakistani.

63
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:18,160
- It drove him right out of business.
- Right.

64
00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:21,090
So you going with me
to the auto show Saturday?

65
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:23,495
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can you bring my mail then please?

66
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:25,726
- What mail?
- I picked up his mail...

67
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,564
while he was on the road.
- Why didn't Kramer pick it up?

68
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,333
Because he was at that baseball
fantasy camp in Florida.

69
00:03:31,408 --> 00:03:34,136
Oh, yeah, right.
When's he coming back?

70
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:38,111
- Monday, I think.
- Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.

71
00:03:38,182 --> 00:03:40,910
His whole life is a fantasy camp.

72
00:03:40,984 --> 00:03:45,111
People should plunk down $2000
to live like him for a week.

73
00:03:45,222 --> 00:03:47,847
Do nothing,
fall ass backwards in the money...

74
00:03:47,925 --> 00:03:50,789
mooch food off your neighbors
and have sex without dating.

75
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,588
That's a fantasy camp.

76
00:03:53,697 --> 00:03:56,823
Listen, if you're gonna go out
with this lawyer, have dinner with us...

77
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,798
then maybe you can go
to the auto show with her if you want.

78
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,404
Have a little company.
Take the pressure off.

79
00:04:05,108 --> 00:04:07,676
He never heard of corduroy!

80
00:04:07,744 --> 00:04:09,971
Stop it, you're killing me!

81
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:16,752
Never heard of corduroy.
True story. True story.

82
00:04:17,754 --> 00:04:19,287
Funny.

83
00:04:22,292 --> 00:04:26,089
- No. No, I don't... I don't think so.
- Why?

84
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:29,255
Well, I think I'm better off
going one-on-one.

85
00:04:29,433 --> 00:04:32,934
I don't know why you wanna play
man-to-man when you could play zone.

86
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:35,935
She might not be comfortable.

87
00:04:36,006 --> 00:04:38,301
Why? We're all very nice.
We're very friendly.

88
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:40,466
- We'll be funny.
- No. No.

89
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:42,771
It's not good. I don't think so.

90
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:46,846
All right. If you change your mind,
we'll wind up at Isabella's around 7.

91
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:49,349
No. No Isabella's.
I don't want to go to Isabella's.

92
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:52,454
- Why?
- No, it's too trendy. No Isabella's.

93
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:00,486
Excellent.

94
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,363
Like I really know
what I'm talking about.

95
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:08,126
Toasting makes me uncomfortable.

96
00:05:08,205 --> 00:05:09,966
But toast I love.

97
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,207
Never start the day
without a good piece of toast.

98
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,779
In fact, let's toast to toast.

99
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:25,921
Look who's here. Georgie boy.

100
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:29,392
What are you doing here? I thought
you said you hated Isabella's.

101
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:30,924
No, I talked him into it.

102
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:32,584
What happened to the auto show?

103
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:35,926
Oh, we're still going. Still going.
Elaine, do the spokesmodel.

104
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,493
The turbo quadramatic transmission...

105
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:41,000
offers you the power and prestige
to propel you...

106
00:05:41,071 --> 00:05:43,162
well into the 21 st century.

107
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,474
Hi.

108
00:05:51,848 --> 00:05:54,678
- Hi.
- Cheryl, this is Elaine and Jerry.

109
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,113
Hi. Nice to meet you.

110
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:59,414
- Would you like to join us?
- No, no. They don't wanna join us.

111
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:01,352
- No, it's okay. Don't be silly.
- Okay.

112
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:03,220
Why don't we put
these tables together.

113
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:07,227
You can't do that. They're round.
It makes an eight, and it just...

114
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,360
Jerry. Jerry, tell them that
funny story you were telling me...

115
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,505
No. No.

116
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:19,699
No, George, it's so funny. We saw
this cab driver's picture, right?

117
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:21,468
You know, we should really order.

118
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:24,842
The service is so slow here.
By the time you get anything...

119
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:28,081
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you
a legal question?

120
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:30,453
- I'm being sued.
- Oh, what happened?

121
00:06:31,321 --> 00:06:36,085
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin,
and I crossed against the light...

122
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:39,762
and I knocked over
the delivery boy.

123
00:06:40,664 --> 00:06:43,198
Was he Chinese?

124
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,726
Yeah.

125
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:47,495
Is your..? Is your last name "Benes"?

126
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:52,005
- How did you know?
- Oh, God! Ping is my cousin.

127
00:06:52,075 --> 00:06:53,699
No.

128
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,535
- That's so funny.
- I'm handling his case.

129
00:06:56,613 --> 00:06:57,702
What?

130
00:06:57,781 --> 00:06:59,940
- You're Cheryl Fong?
- That's right.

131
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,378
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God.

132
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:04,543
I can't believe it.
This is such a coincidence.

133
00:07:04,621 --> 00:07:05,881
I know.

134
00:07:06,356 --> 00:07:07,821
Wow. Well, I...

135
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:11,392
I guess you don't have any advice
for me on how to win the case.

136
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:18,090
Will you excuse me?
I have to make a call.

137
00:07:19,603 --> 00:07:20,863
Tell Ping I said hello.

138
00:07:22,072 --> 00:07:25,471
Tell him you think you may have
broken the case wide open.

139
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:32,110
I can't believe it.

140
00:07:32,182 --> 00:07:34,273
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

141
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:36,885
- What?
- This is not good. This is not good.

142
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:39,521
- What's the matter?
- I don't think it's a great idea...

143
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:41,316
- for you to sit here.
- Why not?

144
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:44,051
He thinks if you're too funny,
he might not look so funny.

145
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,489
Biff.

146
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:47,457
What?

147
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:50,725
- You're not worried about that?
- No, of course not.

148
00:07:50,801 --> 00:07:53,131
I mean, so what if I'm funny.
Who cares?

149
00:07:53,203 --> 00:07:56,295
He thinks that if a woman
sees a guy put on a better show...

150
00:07:56,373 --> 00:07:59,931
she'll walk out on his show,
go see the other show.

151
00:08:00,544 --> 00:08:01,770
Well, should we leave?

152
00:08:01,845 --> 00:08:04,413
Well, maybe you don't have
to be so funny.

153
00:08:04,481 --> 00:08:06,776
Would it kill you
not to be so funny all the time?

154
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,076
That's all I'm asking.

155
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:09,718
This woman thinks I'm very funny.

156
00:08:09,786 --> 00:08:12,013
Now you're gonna be funny,
so, what am I gonna be?

157
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:16,318
I'll be a short, bald guy with glasses
who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.

158
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:21,497
This is so ridiculous.
Can we just go over there?

159
00:08:21,565 --> 00:08:24,327
Look, I don't have to be funny.
I don't care.

160
00:08:24,401 --> 00:08:25,661
- You don't?
- No way.

161
00:08:25,735 --> 00:08:27,496
It's completely under my control.

162
00:08:27,871 --> 00:08:31,338
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.

163
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:33,305
Of course I can.
Am I being funny now?

164
00:08:34,277 --> 00:08:35,776
A little.

165
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,039
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?

166
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:39,643
Yeah.

167
00:08:39,716 --> 00:08:41,181
George, is this funny?

168
00:08:41,518 --> 00:08:43,142
It's funny.

169
00:08:44,988 --> 00:08:47,352
And it wouldn't kill you to not
be so funny either.

170
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:49,014
What? What did I do?

171
00:08:49,092 --> 00:08:50,557
- Hi.
- Hi.

172
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,493
Hello.

173
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,358
Welcome back.

174
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,231
I'm sorry. It was my aunt's birthday.

175
00:09:02,305 --> 00:09:03,963
She makes such a big deal about it.

176
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:06,537
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?

177
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,612
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic
of how another year has gone by...

178
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,612
and how little we've grown.

179
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:16,575
No matter how desperate we are
that someday...

180
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:19,950
a better self will emerge, each flicker
of the candles on the cake...

181
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:21,488
we know it's not to be.

182
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:26,055
But for the rest of our sad,
wretched, pathetic lives...

183
00:09:27,397 --> 00:09:29,522
this is who we are to the bitter end...

184
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,463
inevitably, irrevocably.

185
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:36,970
Happy birthday? No such thing.

186
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,870
Funny guy, huh?

187
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:48,016
Here, take it.
I was glad to get rid of it.

188
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:50,709
Well, thank you very much.
It's about time.

189
00:09:51,421 --> 00:09:53,250
Oh, listen. So guess what.

190
00:09:53,456 --> 00:09:57,356
Cheryl convinced Ping
to drop the case against me.

191
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:59,119
Drop the case?

192
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:01,593
Wow, congratulations.
That will save you some money.

193
00:10:01,665 --> 00:10:04,563
Yeah. No kidding. That lawyer
was gonna charge me a fortune.

194
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:09,066
Oh, great. Birth announcement
from Arnie and Joy Harris.

195
00:10:11,408 --> 00:10:14,238
Hear that? Guess who's back.

196
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,846
Thought you weren't
coming back till Monday.

197
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:26,453
Well, the camp ended
a few days early.

198
00:10:28,158 --> 00:10:29,555
Why?

199
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:31,250
Well, there was an incident.

200
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,790
What happened?

201
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:37,091
I punched Mickey Mantle
in the mouth.

202
00:10:37,734 --> 00:10:39,301
- What?
- Yeah, I punched him...

203
00:10:39,369 --> 00:10:41,164
and they took him
to the hospital...

204
00:10:41,237 --> 00:10:43,498
and then they canceled
the rest of the week.

205
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:45,265
You punched who in the mouth?

206
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:47,000
Mickey Mantle.

207
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:49,102
What happened?

208
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:51,110
Well, you know,
we were playing a game...

209
00:10:51,181 --> 00:10:54,148
and I was pitching.
I was really throwing some smoke.

210
00:10:54,284 --> 00:10:56,477
And Joe Pepitone, he was up...

211
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:59,213
and, man, that guy,
he was crowding the plate.

212
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:00,720
Wow, Joe Pepitone.

213
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,688
Well, Joe Pepitone or not,
I own the inside of that plate.

214
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,852
So, you know,
I throw one inside, you know.

215
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,897
A little chin music
right on his pants...

216
00:11:09,966 --> 00:11:12,967
because I gotta intimidate,
you know, when I'm on the mound.

217
00:11:13,036 --> 00:11:16,128
Well, the next pitch,
he's right back in the same place.

218
00:11:16,206 --> 00:11:19,070
So I had to plunk him.

219
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,700
- You plunked him?
- Oh, yeah.

220
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:25,405
Well, he throws down his bat,
he comes racing up to the mound.

221
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:27,812
Next thing,
both benches are cleared, you know.

222
00:11:27,884 --> 00:11:30,782
A brouhaha breaks out between
the guys in the camp, you know...

223
00:11:30,854 --> 00:11:32,285
and the old Yankee players.

224
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:35,356
As I'm trying to get Moose Skowron
off of one of my teammates...

225
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:37,254
somebody pulls me from behind...

226
00:11:37,327 --> 00:11:40,191
and I turned around
and I popped him.

227
00:11:40,263 --> 00:11:43,355
I looked down and whoa, man!
It's Mickey.

228
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:46,530
I punched his lights out.

229
00:11:46,936 --> 00:11:48,435
Wow, this is incredible.

230
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:51,831
Leave me alone!
You can't do this to me.

231
00:11:51,941 --> 00:11:53,201
What's going on out there?

232
00:11:53,276 --> 00:11:54,400
What are you doing?

233
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:58,479
This is not right, people. You're
making a very bad mistake. Very bad.

234
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,843
Babu. I'll be right back.

235
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:03,076
- Yeah, so...
- Hank Bauer, he's screaming:

236
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:06,586
"Mickey! What have you done
with Mickey! You killed Mickey!"

237
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:11,319
- So, what did you do?
- Well, I got the hell out of there.

238
00:12:12,328 --> 00:12:13,861
They took Babu away.

239
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,588
They took Babu away?

240
00:12:15,665 --> 00:12:18,427
Yeah, the immigration guy
said his visa was expired.

241
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:20,967
Poor Babu. Everything was going
so well for him.

242
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:22,832
He had an apartment, he had a job.

243
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:25,497
- What a shame.
- Jerry!

244
00:12:26,876 --> 00:12:28,773
Help me!

245
00:12:28,845 --> 00:12:34,474
I will, Babu!
I will help you, Babu! Don't worry!

246
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:37,384
Then Hank Bauer, you know,
he's chasing me around.

247
00:12:37,454 --> 00:12:40,546
He trips over third base
and knocks over Clete Boyer.

248
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:42,855
What?

249
00:12:43,293 --> 00:12:46,123
- Well, this is interesting.
- What is it?

250
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,594
It's a letter
from the Immigration Bureau.

251
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:52,701
It's Babu's
visa-renewal application form.

252
00:12:54,037 --> 00:12:56,264
They must have put it
in my mailbox by mistake.

253
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:59,074
Well, doesn't he need that?

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

255
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:11,548
If you'd given me my mail last week,
this never would have happened.

256
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:14,087
Well, you should have come
to my house to pick it up.

257
00:13:14,157 --> 00:13:16,555
- So am I being funny now?
- No, actually, you're not.

258
00:13:16,626 --> 00:13:19,320
See, I told you I wasn't funny
all the time.

259
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,924
Hey, George, look,
I'm not funny now.

260
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:26,033
No, and you weren't funny last night.
You got us both so depressed...

261
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:28,329
she asked me to drive
her home after dinner.

262
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:30,062
I need to get in touch with Cheryl.

263
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,969
Babu needs a lawyer.
His visa's expired.

264
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,472
There's a million lawyers.

265
00:13:33,543 --> 00:13:36,669
Yeah, but you said this is one
of the things that her firm does.

266
00:13:36,746 --> 00:13:39,781
All right, but no funny business.
Same deal as last night.

267
00:13:39,849 --> 00:13:42,975
- Will you stop it already.
- Jerry, please.

268
00:13:43,052 --> 00:13:44,551
How long is this gonna go on?

269
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:46,752
Till I'm comfortable.

270
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:48,914
Well, when is that gonna be?

271
00:13:48,992 --> 00:13:50,957
After consummation.

272
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:56,031
Consummation? I don't think
you have enough material.

273
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,097
I have a friend in the immigration
department who owes me a big favor.

274
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:05,832
You're very lucky.

275
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:13,140
That's wonderful news. Thank you.

276
00:14:14,484 --> 00:14:16,779
You're a very serious person,
aren't you?

277
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:22,715
Well, with so many people
in the world deprived and unhappy...

278
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:26,692
it doesn't seem like it would
be fair to be cheerful.

279
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:35,096
I understand.

280
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:37,133
I think that's curdled.

281
00:14:37,207 --> 00:14:39,241
I don't care.

282
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,441
Do you ever laugh?

283
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:48,875
Not really.
Sometimes when I'm in the tub.

284
00:14:50,587 --> 00:14:53,019
That's so sad.

285
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:54,281
What do you do?

286
00:14:54,357 --> 00:14:55,924
I'm a comedian.

287
00:14:57,927 --> 00:14:59,790
Oh, let me get that.

288
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:02,093
You've been so helpful.

289
00:15:05,468 --> 00:15:08,036
Hey, we're gonna go
see Babu now, right?

290
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:10,172
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.

291
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,433
I'm just gonna say hi to Cheryl.

292
00:15:12,508 --> 00:15:14,007
- Hi.
- Hi.

293
00:15:14,077 --> 00:15:16,645
Listen, gosh,
I wanted to thank you so much...

294
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:18,974
for convincing Ping
to drop the case.

295
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:22,584
After we met, you were all so nice,
I just couldn't go through with it.

296
00:15:22,652 --> 00:15:25,516
But between you and me, you would
have paid through the nose.

297
00:15:28,124 --> 00:15:30,920
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.

298
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:42,765
- Babu.
- Jerry! Jerry. Hello, Jerry,

299
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,931
- You remember Elaine.
- Yes, yes, of course.

300
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:49,077
- Nice to meet you.
- So nice of you both to come.

301
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:53,011
- Oh, Babu.
- No, you're both very kind. Very kind.

302
00:15:53,082 --> 00:15:55,810
- Oh, well, you know, we try.
- We do what we can.

303
00:15:55,885 --> 00:15:58,180
- We do what we can.
- See...

304
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:01,187
the problem is, I never got my
visa-renewal form in the mail.

305
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:05,919
- I was expecting it.
- Yes. See, here's the thing, Babu.

306
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:07,494
What happened was...

307
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:10,325
I was away for a couple of weeks
doing some comedy shows.

308
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,559
The comedy shows,
you're very funny man.

309
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:16,964
Well, Elaine, here, was picking up
my mail while I was away...

310
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,233
because that little box
can get very full.

311
00:16:19,309 --> 00:16:21,673
Yes, of course.
TV Guide, magazines, everything.

312
00:16:21,811 --> 00:16:23,378
I would have picked up your mail.

313
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:26,242
- Your box is right next to mine.
- I don't want to bother you.

314
00:16:26,316 --> 00:16:29,908
No bother. You get me job. You get
me apartment, you very good man.

315
00:16:29,986 --> 00:16:32,680
Well, yesterday,
after they took you away...

316
00:16:32,755 --> 00:16:35,380
I looked in my mail,
and I noticed that the mailman...

317
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:38,959
accidentally put your
visa-renewal in my mailbox.

318
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:40,254
Come again?

319
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:41,897
See, I've been home for a week...

320
00:16:41,965 --> 00:16:44,465
and Elaine didn't give me my mail
till yesterday...

321
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,398
even though
I asked her repeatedly for it.

322
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,301
Yeah, but, Babu, he could have come
to my house to pick it up.

323
00:16:51,374 --> 00:16:53,101
You had my visa application?

324
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:54,834
- Well, not technically.
- I kill you!

325
00:16:55,111 --> 00:16:56,906
- What about her?
- I kill both of you!

326
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,274
- Babu.
- No Babu.

327
00:16:58,348 --> 00:17:00,916
No Babu. You're bad man.
You're very bad man.

328
00:17:00,984 --> 00:17:02,415
You're very lazy, bad man.

329
00:17:02,485 --> 00:17:04,212
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything.

330
00:17:04,287 --> 00:17:07,220
I have a lawyer who knows someone
in the immigration department.

331
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,325
They'll straighten the whole thing out.
The wheels are in motion.

332
00:17:10,393 --> 00:17:11,926
Things are happening
as we speak.

333
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:14,461
- The wheels are in motion?
- The wheels are in motion.

334
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,824
Things are happening.

335
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:20,964
Jerry?

336
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:22,468
I'm very attracted to him.

337
00:17:22,638 --> 00:17:25,434
You think the person
you were talking to was him?

338
00:17:25,508 --> 00:17:30,102
That's not even close to him.
He's funny. Jerry's funny.

339
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,373
- He's never said anything funny.
- He can't not be funny.

340
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:38,612
No, no. He's dark and disturbed.

341
00:17:38,688 --> 00:17:41,450
Dark and disturbed?

342
00:17:41,524 --> 00:17:44,616
His whole life revolves around
Superman and cereal.

343
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:46,956
What kind of a friend are you?

344
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,827
I convinced him to act like that so
that you would think I was funnier.

345
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,025
That's how disturbed I am.

346
00:17:53,102 --> 00:17:55,329
You want disturbed?
That's disturbed.

347
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:58,030
I mean, you can't find sickness
like that anywhere.

348
00:17:58,107 --> 00:18:00,402
You think sickness like that
grows on trees?

349
00:18:00,476 --> 00:18:02,737
Nobody is sicker than me. Nobody.

350
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:05,073
He's pretending.
I am the genuine article.

351
00:18:05,148 --> 00:18:07,842
You're telling me Jerry's whole thing
was an act?

352
00:18:07,917 --> 00:18:11,384
And I put him up to it,
because I'm sick.

353
00:18:11,454 --> 00:18:13,818
I'm the one that needs help.

354
00:18:15,725 --> 00:18:16,985
I gotta go.

355
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,724
Well, should I call you later?

356
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:20,988
Please don't.

357
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:24,759
But... But I'm disturbed.
I'm depressed.

358
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:28,870
I'm inadequate. I got it all!

359
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,973
So, what's up with Babu?
How come he's not back?

360
00:18:35,044 --> 00:18:37,044
I don't know. I don't understand it.

361
00:18:37,113 --> 00:18:40,705
Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it. He should be back by now.

362
00:18:41,751 --> 00:18:43,318
- Yeah?
- George.

363
00:18:43,386 --> 00:18:45,511
- Come on up.
- Babu.

364
00:18:45,888 --> 00:18:49,219
- Babu, what happened to you?
- Babu must be back.

365
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,587
- Well, where's Babu?
- He is in Pakistan!

366
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:53,820
- Who are you?
- I am his brother.

367
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:56,430
He knew a lawyer.
It was all going to be fixed.

368
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:58,590
I'm sure the lawyer
did everything they could.

369
00:18:58,668 --> 00:19:01,532
Then where is Babu?
What happened to Babu?

370
00:19:01,604 --> 00:19:03,729
Show me Babu!

371
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,506
- Snapple?
- No.

372
00:19:09,378 --> 00:19:11,207
Too fruity.

373
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:16,915
Hey, what happened?

374
00:19:16,986 --> 00:19:19,281
I thought Cheryl
was gonna help Babu get his visa.

375
00:19:19,355 --> 00:19:21,320
- She didn't help him?
- No.

376
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,788
- Where is he?
- He's in Pakistan.

377
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:25,718
Oh, boy

378
00:19:26,062 --> 00:19:27,754
What do you mean, "Oh, boy"?

379
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,390
Well, last night she told me
that she liked you.

380
00:19:32,468 --> 00:19:34,729
Not you, the disturbed you.

381
00:19:35,438 --> 00:19:37,267
So I had to tell her the truth.

382
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,738
You told her the truth?
Well, you got Babu deported!

383
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:43,003
What do you mean I "got"? You didn't
give him his visa application.

384
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:44,544
That's because she had my mail.

385
00:19:44,614 --> 00:19:48,150
Well, I wouldn't have to get your mail
if he didn't go to that fantasy camp.

386
00:19:48,217 --> 00:19:51,081
Well, I just came back
from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.

387
00:19:51,154 --> 00:19:52,949
How could you go in there?

388
00:19:53,022 --> 00:19:55,852
Well, I had to. I had to apologize.

389
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,458
I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,
my idol.

390
00:19:58,528 --> 00:20:00,653
It was eating me up inside!

391
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:02,356
Well, what happened?

392
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:05,295
I got down on my knees, and I went,
"Go ahead, Mickey, hit me.

393
00:20:05,368 --> 00:20:08,460
I'm begging you, Mickey.
Please, hit me. Come on, hit me.

394
00:20:08,538 --> 00:20:10,799
I love you, Mickey. I love you."

395
00:20:10,873 --> 00:20:12,270
So, what did he do?

396
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:15,308
Well, the four of them, they picked
me up by my pants...

397
00:20:15,378 --> 00:20:18,311
and they threw me outside,
right into a horse.

398
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,344
- Kramer.
- Hey!

399
00:20:22,418 --> 00:20:24,816
Yeah. It's my Chinese food.

400
00:20:24,887 --> 00:20:27,046
Oh, Ping. Hi.

401
00:20:27,123 --> 00:20:30,590
Listen, thank you so much
for dropping that lawsuit against me.

402
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,785
- Not anymore.
- What?

403
00:20:32,862 --> 00:20:35,829
Cheryl call me last night.
Lawsuit back on.

404
00:20:35,898 --> 00:20:37,329
Why?

405
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,832
She call you
and your friends big liars.

406
00:20:39,902 --> 00:20:41,867
You think she nice girl?

407
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:45,405
Wait till you see her in court.
She's a shark!

408
00:20:45,474 --> 00:20:47,974
They call her "The Terminator."

409
00:20:48,044 --> 00:20:52,672
She never lose a case,
and now you make her mad.

410
00:20:52,748 --> 00:20:55,043
She doubled the damages.

411
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:58,550
Hasta la vista, baby.

412
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,825
So his friend had the mail,
but she did not give it to him.

413
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:09,496
And then he came to visit me...

414
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:13,465
said a lawyer would call and help.
He said the wheels were in motion.

415
00:21:13,536 --> 00:21:16,969
But there was no motion.
There was nothing.

416
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,334
And so they sent me back here.

417
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,939
This is a terrible story, Babu.

418
00:21:22,478 --> 00:21:24,045
What are you going to do?

419
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:27,011
I'm going to save up every rupee...

420
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,673
for someday...

421
00:21:28,751 --> 00:21:32,287
I will get back to America,
and when I do...

422
00:21:32,355 --> 00:21:35,185
I will exact vengeance
on this man.

423
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:37,119
I cannot forget him.

424
00:21:37,193 --> 00:21:39,158
He haunts me.

425
00:21:39,362 --> 00:21:45,958
He's a very bad man.
He's a very, very bad man.

426
00:21:46,302 --> 00:21:47,835
I am for open immigration...

427
00:21:47,903 --> 00:21:50,369
but that sign we have
on the Statue of Liberty:

428
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:53,736
"Give us your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses."

429
00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,401
Can't we just say, "Hey, the door's
open, we'll take whoever you got."

430
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,311
Do we have to specify
the "wretched refuse"?

431
00:22:01,384 --> 00:22:02,815
I mean, why don't we just say:

432
00:22:02,885 --> 00:22:05,476
"Give us the unhappy, the sad,
the slow, the ugly...

433
00:22:05,588 --> 00:22:08,384
people that can't drive,
that they have trouble merging...

434
00:22:08,457 --> 00:22:12,015
if they can't stay in their lane,
don't signal, can't parallel park...

435
00:22:12,094 --> 00:22:15,220
if they're sneezing, if they're
stuffed up, if they're clogged...

436
00:22:15,298 --> 00:22:18,959
if they have bad penmanship, don't
return calls, if they have dandruff...

437
00:22:19,035 --> 00:22:23,663
food between their teeth, if they have
bad credit, if they have no credit...

438
00:22:23,739 --> 00:22:26,000
missed a spot shaving."
In other words...

439
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:29,838
any dysfunctional, defective slob...

440
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:32,480
that you can somehow cattle prod
onto a wagon...

441
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:35,242
send them over, we want them.

441
00:22:36,305 --> 00:22:42,214
