# JERRY
I find it fascinating, when you go
in the stationery store...
**LOL**
that they're manufacturing
millions of pens constantly.
We're all buying them. I must have
bought 6000 Bics in my life.
I've used up maybe two of them.
Where's the rest of them?
Move a refrigerator,
there's a couple there.
**LOL**
But that doesn't account for it.
Where are all the pens?
That's why it's embarrassing
if you don't have one.
"You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen?"
We always have to whisper...
because it's so humiliating.
"l don't have a pen."
**LOL**
# STATIONER
"They're making millions
of them every week."
"l know. Where are they?"
**LOL**
May I help you?
# ELAINE
Yeah, hi.
I'm looking for a Rolamech 1000.
 It's a mechanical pencil.
# STATIONER
 Oh, I know the Rolamech 1000.
# ELAINE
No, I'm sure you do.
**LOL**
# STATIONER
They're pretty expensive.
# ELAINE
Well, it's for my boss.
# STATIONER
What do you do?
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Whatever.
# STATIONER
Well, we don't have any
in stock right now...
but I would be happy
to order it for you.
Just give me your phone number...
and when it comes in,
I'll give you a call.
Your name is...?
# ELAINE
Elaine.
# STATIONER
Elaine.
**LOL**
 And your last name?
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 It's just Elaine. Like Cher.
# STATIONER
And your number?
# ELAINE
It's KL5-2390.
# STATIONER
Okay. Thanks a lot.
 You'll be hearing from me.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 Okay. So long.
# JERRY
 Why did you give him my number?
# ELAINE
 Don't worry about it.
I think he got ideas.
# JERRY
I wonder if any woman
ever said that about Einstein.
# ELAINE
Just call me when
the pencil comes in.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer
a pencil to a pen anyway?
Hey, look who's here.
# GEORGE
# ELAINE
Hey.
**LOL**
# JULIE
 Hi, Jerry.
# JERRY
 Hi, Julie.
# GEORGE
Elaine, Julie.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
# JULIE
 Hi.
# JULIE
 Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.
# ELAINE
Mine's Ike.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Hey, wanna get some lunch?
# JERRY
Just had a big bowl of Kix.
# GEORGE
Oh, well, that's very mature.
 What about you?
# ELAINE
# JULIE
 Oh, please come, Elaine.
# ELAINE
No. Maybe you could
bring me back something.
# GEORGE
 Sure, all right. What do you want?
# ELAINE
 I don't know.
**LOL**
 A big salad.
# GEORGE
 What big salad?
 I'm going to the coffee shop.
# ELAINE
 They have big salads.
# GEORGE
I've never seen a big salad.
# ELAINE
They have big salads.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Is that what I ask for,
the big salad?
# ELAINE
 It's okay. Just forget it.
# GEORGE
 No, hey, I'll get it.
What's in the big salad?
**LOL**
# JERRY
Big lettuce, big carrots.
Tomatoes like volleyballs.
# GEORGE
So you gonna be upstairs?
See you in a little while.
 Okay.
 Okay.
# ELAINE
Maybe I should just get married.
# JERRY
Dating really is getting
embarrassing, isn't it?
# ELAINE
I know. Whenever I'm on a date,
I always feel like people can tell.
# JERRY
People on dates shouldn't be
allowed out in public.
# ELAINE
# JERRY
It's embarrassing for them.
**LOL**
It's painful for us to watch.
I'm going out with someone later,
I'm not even taking her out.
# ELAINE
 Good for you.
# JERRY
 I don't need people staring at us.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
You're telling me.
**LOL**
# JERRY
What was that?
# KRAMER
Gendason. What a jerk.
**LOL**
I'm never playing golf
with him again.
# ELAINE
 Who? Gendason?
# KRAMER
 Steve Gendason.
# ELAINE
Why does that name
sound so familiar?
**LOL**
# HXX
 He used to be a baseball player.
# ELAINE
 How'd you end up playing golf with him?
# KRAMER
I met him on the course
a couple years ago.
Yeah. Played with him a lot.
But today was it.
**LOL**
We're on the 15th hole.
He's beating me by a couple
of strokes.
Then he's about to hit
his second shot...
when he picks up the ball
and cleans it.
# ELAINE
 So what?
# KRAMER
 Sorry.
The rules clearly state you cannot
clean the ball unless it's on the green.
 The rules are clear about that.
# JERRY
 Certainly are.
# KRAMER
 So I penalized him a stroke.
# JXX
 So, what happened?
# KRAMER
He lost it!
**LOL**
We almost came to blows.
We're face to face,
like a manager and an umpire.
We're like,
"Hey, what are you talking about?!
 Think I'm gonna put up with that?!"
# JERRY
 All right. All right! You're in my face.
# ELAINE
I don't see what the big deal is.
# KRAMER
Hey, a rule is a rule. And let's face it,
without rules, there's chaos.
**LOL**
# JULIE
I like Anna Quindlen's column.
And Safire.
Don't you like Safire?
# GEORGE
Safire.
**LOL**
# JULIE
Although at times
he can be rather pedantic.
# GEORGE
He can be pedantic.
He can be pedantic.
# JULIE
And Bob Herbert's great.
**LOL**
He worked for the <i>Daily News</i>.
# GEORGE
Yes. Yes.
You know what's interesting?
The quarterback
for the Atlanta Falcons...
is Bobby Hebert, no R...
which I find fascinating.
You know, it's Herbert...
H-E-R-B-E-R-T...
Hebert, H-E-B-E-R-T.
**LOL**
Hebert. It's a fun name to pronounce.
Try and say it. Hebert.
Go ahead, take a shot. Hebert.
All right.
# JULIE
 Thanks. I got it.
 No. I'd like to pay.
# GEORGE
Now, Julie, Julie, don't insult me.
What difference does it make
who pays? It's meaningless.
# JULIE
 Okay, thanks, George.
**LOL**
# WXX
 Here's your big salad to go.
# JULIE
Oh, thank you.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Hello.
No, she's not here.
Okay, fine. Whatever.
Yes, I'll tell her.
Okay, goodbye.
Stationery-store guy called
to say he ordered your pencil.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
I told you. He has ideas.
# JERRY
He doesn't even care
if a man answers.
# ELAINE
Or you.
# GEORGE
 Hey.
# ELAINE
 Hey.
Hey.
# JULIE
 Sorry we're late.
# ELAINE
 It's no problem.
# JULIE
 Here's your big salad.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 Thank you, Julie.
# JULIE
You're very welcome.
So I guess I better get going.
Meeting Mother at the Guggenheim.
You don't wanna go?
# GEORGE
No, you Guggenheim.
I'm not much of a Guggenheimer.
# JULIE
 You sure?
# GEORGE
 Yeah, yeah. You go.
# JULIE
 Okay, I'll see you later. Bye-bye.
 Bye-bye.
**LOL**
# JERRY
# GEORGE
Did you see
what just happened here?
# JERRY
Well, that all depends.
# GEORGE
Did you happen to notice that Julie
handed the big salad to Elaine?
# JERRY
 Yeah, so?
# GEORGE
 Well, she didn't buy the big salad.
I bought the big salad.
# JERRY
 Is that a fact?
# GEORGE
 Yes, it is.
She just took credit for my salad.
 That's not right.
# JERRY
 No, it isn't.
# GEORGE
 I'm the one who bought it.
# JERRY
 You did.
# GEORGE
 She should've said something.
# JERRY
 She could have.
# GEORGE
 Oh, I know.
# JERRY
 Imagine...
her taking credit
for your big salad.
# GEORGE
You buy a big salad for somebody,
it would be nice if they knew it.
# JERRY
Obviously.
# KRAMER
 Turn on the TV.
# JERRY
 What?
# KRAMER
Put it on. Put it on!

 Jerry.

 Well, it had nothing to do with you.

Yeah, but maybe he was so mad
from the penalty stroke...
that he murdered the dry cleaner.
# JERRY
Generally speaking,
you don't need any extra incentive...
to murder a dry cleaner.
I wouldn't worry about it.
# ELAINE
 I like Julie. She's very personable.
# GEORGE
 Yeah, she's lovely.
# ELAINE
 That's great, George.
# GEORGE
 Yeah.
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday
 So did you enjoy your lunch?
# ELAINE
 Yeah. The big salad.
It was very good.
Actually, it was too big.
# GEORGE
 Why?
 Oh, no reason.
Because, you know,
she handed you the bag.
I could have handed you the bag.
But she happened to picked it up
at the restaurant, even though....
# ELAINE
Even though what?
# GEORGE
It's just....
You thanked her, even though....
What's the difference?
# ELAINE
What? What are you
trying to say, George?
# GEORGE
It's just that I was the one
that actually paid for the big salad.
She just happened to hand it to you.
But it's no big deal.
# ELAINE
You want the money
for the big salad, George?
# GEORGE
 No, no.
# ELAINE
 Then what is your problem?
# GEORGE
There is no problem.
Just a small miscommunication
whereby you thanked her...
instead of the person
actually responsible...
for the purchasing
of the big salad.
# JERRY
Kramer played golf with him,
and Kramer thinks a penalty stroke...
may have driven him to it.
# MARGARET
Well, they haven't even
arrested him yet.
Come on. Let's go out.
# JERRY
No, I don't think so.
# MARGARET
Why not?
# JERRY
We don't need a bunch of people
staring at us.
# MARGARET
 Who's staring?
# JERRY
 Oh, they're staring.
They know we're on a date.
They're making fun.
Come on. It's embarrassing.
# JERRY
Hello?
No, she's not here.
Yes, I will tell her.
No, I don't know what time
she might be coming back.
Look, I gotta go.
Bye.
That's.... It's a long story.
# JERRY
Hello, Newman.
# MARGARET
Hello, Jerry.
I was wondering if you knew...
 where Kramer was.
# JERRY
 No, I don't. Why?
# MARGARET
You know, Gendason.
This is something, isn't it?
# JERRY
 I suppose.
# MARGARET
 What did Kramer say?
# JERRY
 I don't know. Nothing.
# MARGARET
 Come on, Jerry.
You know something.
Tell me! Tell me!
Oh, Chunkys.
Margaret?
# MARGARET
 Hello.
# JERRY
 You two know each other?
# NEWMAN
You might say that.
# MARGARET
We used to go out.
# NEWMAN
Well, toodle-loo.
Nice seeing you again, Margaret.
Bye, Jerry.
Have fun.
# JERRY
You went out with Newman?
# MARGARET
 Just a few times.
# JERRY
 Why?
# MARGARET
 I liked him.
# JERRY
 You liked Newman?
# MARGARET
Look, I'm a little uncomfortable
talking about this, okay?
# JERRY
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious.
Why did you stop seeing him?
# MARGARET
He ended it.
# JERRY
He ended it?
# MARGARET
Yes. Yes.
It was a couple of years ago.
Why, does it matter?
# JERRY
No. No, of course not.
# KRAMER
Jerry, they found a tee.
# JERRY
 What tee?
# KRAMER
 A golf tee in the dry cleaner.
# JERRY
Newman.
She went out with Newman.
# ELAINE
 It must be a mistake.
 No. It isn't.
# JERRY
And the most distressing part
is not that she went out with him...
but that he stopped seeing her.
Do you understand? He, Newman...
Newman stopped seeing her.
Newman never stops
seeing anybody.
Newman will see
whoever is willing to see him.
So the question, then, is not
so much why did she see him...
as disturbing as that is...
but why did he, Newman,
stop seeing her?
# ELAINE
Perhaps there's more to Newman
than meets the eye.
# JERRY
No. There's less.
# ELAINE
 It's possible.
# JERRY
 No, it isn't.
I've looked into his eyes.
He's pure evil.
# ELAINE
Maybe he's an enigma.
A mystery wrapped in a riddle.
# JERRY
Yeah. He's a mystery
wrapped in a Twinkie.
# WXX
 Can I get you some more coffee?
# JERRY
 No, but thank you.
# JERRY
By the way, your stationery-store guy
called. He's got your pencil.
# ELAINE
You are kidding me.
# JERRY
No. He left the store early, made a
special trip to the distributor and got it.
# ELAINE
I bought one yesterday
on 14th Street.
# JERRY
What did you do that for?
He already ordered it.
# ELAINE
 I wanted to please Mr. Pitt.
# JERRY
 You better go down and tell this guy.
 He's very excited.
 Oh, boy.
# ELAINE
# JERRY
 Oh, hi, Julie.
# JERRY
 Hi.
# ELAINE
 Hi, Julie.
# JERRY
 How are you, Elaine?
 I'm meeting George here.
# ELAINE
 Well, then I better get going.
Otherwise George will make me
buy him lunch...
to make up for that big salad
he bought me yesterday.
# JERRY
How do you know that?
# NEWMAN
 Who is it?
# JERRY
 It's Jerry.
# NEWMAN
It's kind of a bad time.
Could you come back later?
# JERRY
Come on, Newman, open the door!
# NEWMAN
Hello, Jerry.
What a rare treat. What brings you
down to the east wing?
# JERRY
Okay, pudgy, let's stop playing games.
What happened with Margaret?
# NEWMAN
Don't get excited.
Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?
# JERRY
No, we can't. My skin is crawling
just being inside your little rat's nest.
 Now, what happened?
# NEWMAN
 You wanna know what happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
She wasn't my type.
# JERRY
 Not your type?
# NEWMAN
 Not really.
# JERRY
 Well, how come?
# NEWMAN
 She just didn't do it for me.
# JERRY
 What is wrong with her?
# NEWMAN
 Well, if you're happy with her...
that's all that matters.
# JERRY
 You don't think she's attractive?
# NEWMAN
 No.
I need a really pretty face.
But, hey, that's me.
# JERRY
Okay, Newman. Thanks a lot.
# NEWMAN
 Care for some lemonade?
# JERRY
 No, thank you.
# NEWMAN
Drop by anytime, Jerry.
# KRAMER
Jerry. All right, now, listen to this.
"lf a player cleans his ball
during play of a hole...
except on the putting green,
he shall incur a penalty of one stroke."
 That's the rule.
# JERRY
 It's just a friendly game.
 Why are you always such a stickler?
# KRAMER
 That's the way I was raised.
When I was growing up,
I had to be in bed every night by 9:00.
And if I wasn't.... Well, I don't have
to tell you what happened.
# JERRY
What are you so worried
about this for?
# KRAMER
You know he talked about Pinkus
on the course?
# JERRY
 He did?
# KRAMER
 Oh, yeah.
He said he brought his pants to
Pinkus', and they came back stained...
with some kind
of dry-cleaning fluid.
And Pinkus denied responsibility.
You see?
He was very upset at Pinkus.
# JERRY
So it had nothing to do with you.
# KRAMER
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him
over the edge.
# JERRY
 No, I don't think so.
# KRAMER
 Poor Pinkus.
Poor little Pinkus.
# JERRY
Hey, let me ask you a question.
You met Margaret.
You think Margaret's good-looking?
She's a natural beauty.
No makeup? I like that.
# JERRY
Yeah. And the curls?
You like the curls?
# KRAMER
 Oh, I love curls.
# JERRY
 Yeah. Yeah, me too.
# KRAMER
 I'll see you later.
# JERRY
 Where you going?
# KRAMER
# JERRY
 Gendason's.
 You're going to see Gendason?
# KRAMER
It's weighing on my conscience.
# GEORGE
I think I could have played with dolls
if there were dolls in the house.
It seems like fun to me.
It doesn't seem like a gender thing.
I think I would like to play with dolls.
What's so terrible?
# JULIE
So, George, I was talking
to Elaine before...
# GEORGE
We're just friends.
# JULIE
Yes, well, anyway, she said something
that was kind of intriguing.
# GEORGE
Share.
# JULIE
Well, when I came over to the table,
she mentioned something...
about how she'd better hurry up and
leave or you'd make her buy lunch...
to make up for the one
you bought yesterday.
# GEORGE
I'm not following.
# JULIE
Well, my question is, how could Elaine
be under the impression...
that you bought the big salad...
when I was the one
that handed it to her?
# GEORGE
Well, she probably just assumed.
# JULIE
Did she?
# GEORGE
Wait a second.
Are you suggesting that I went
out of my way to tell Elaine...
that even though you handed her
the big salad, that it came from me?
# JULIE
That's what I'm suggesting.
# GEORGE
Well, it was a big salad.
And what I would like to know
is how does a person...
who has virtually nothing
to do with the big salad...
claim responsibility
for that salad...
and accept a thank-you
under false pretenses?
# JULIE
George, all I did was
hand someone a bag.
# ELAINE
It's just that my boss
is very demanding...
and he needed the pencil
right away.
# STATIONER
Well, why did you tell me
to order it if you knew...
you were going to get one
someplace else?
# ELAINE
No, I didn't know. I'm sorry.
# STATIONER
I went all the way down
to the warehouse.
It took me three hours.
I had a big fight with the foreman.
# ELAINE
Really? A fight with the foreman?
# STATIONER
 Yes.
# ELAINE
 Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.
# STATIONER
Yeah?
Well, then how about
going out with me?
# ELAINE
Okay.
# MARGARET
I mean, they found a tee.
And he played golf that day.
Nobody walks into a dry cleaners'
with a tee.
The circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.
# JERRY
You had how many dates with him?
Three?
# MARGARET
Around three. I don't know.
# JERRY
And...?
# MARGARET
I told you, he stopped calling me.
I moved on. I'm not hung up on him.
 What are you looking at?
# JERRY
 What? I'm not looking. Nothing.
# JERRY
Why are you looking at my face?
# JERRY
Where am I gonna look?
# MARGARET
Kiss me.
# JERRY
I can't.
# JERRY
Newman.
# JERRY
Newman ruined it.
All I could think of...
when I was looking at her face was,
"Newman found this unacceptable."
# ELAINE
I'm going out
with the stationery-store guy.
# JERRY
You're going out
with the stationery-store guy?
# ELAINE
I felt so guilty about the pencil
I couldn't say no.
# ELAINE
Well, well, well.
I'm not treating you
to lunch anymore!
You had to tell Julie that I made
a special point of telling you...
that I bought you
the big salad, didn't you?
# ELAINE
# GEORGE
You know, if it was a regular salad,
I wouldn't have said anything.
But you had to have the big salad!
# JERRY
Hello?
What?
You're kidding.
I'm turning it on.
Oh, my God, get out of here.
Hey, listen to this. They issued
a warrant for Gendason's arrest.
He escaped, and the police spotted
him on the New Jersey Turnpike.
# TV
<i>As you can see,
he's in a white Ford Bronco.</i>
<i>The police have cleared
the highway traffic in front...</i>
<i>but they are keeping
their distance.</i>
<i>They don't want this situation
to escalate.</i>
<i>And we have gotten an identification
on the driver of the vehicle.</i>
His name is Kramer...
and he's reportedly one
of Gendason's golfing buddies.
# POLICE
<i>911, what are you reporting?</i>
# KRAMER
Yeah, this is Kramer.
I got Gendason in the car.
Now, he wants to see his fish.
I'm taking him to see his fish,
so tell the police to back off.
# POLICE
<i>Okay, sir. And what's your name?</i>
# KRAMER
My name is Kramer.
You know who I am, damn it!
# GENDERSON
 I told you not to take the turnpike.
# KRAMER
 I thought we would blend in.
# GENDERSON
If you took the Palisades,
this wouldn't happen.
# KRAMER
 Then we would've had bridge traffic.
# GENDERSON
 Just drive.
To me, murder doesn't even really
seem like that great of a revenge.
Wouldn't years of subtle psychological
mind games be a lot more satisfying?
Constantly calling them and hanging
up when they pick up the phone.
Sending pizzas and taxis
to their house all night long.
After a while they go, "l wish this guy
would kill me. I can't take it anymore!"
How come when the police
catch some really bad criminal...
they put him in the handcuffs,
hit him with the baton...
put the chokehold on him, but then
they don't want him to hurt his head...
