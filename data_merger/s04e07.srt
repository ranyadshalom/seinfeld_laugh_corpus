1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:05,011
Have you ever called someone and were
disappointed when they answered?

2
00:00:05,081 --> 00:00:07,274
You wanted the machine.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,747
You're always thrown off.

4
00:00:08,818 --> 00:00:12,684
You go, "Oh, I... I didn't know
you were there.

5
00:00:12,755 --> 00:00:17,519
I just wanted to leave a message
saying, 'Sorry I missed you. "'

6
00:00:17,627 --> 00:00:21,424
So here's two people who hate each
other, don't really ever wanna talk...

7
00:00:21,597 --> 00:00:24,894
but the phone machine
is like this relationship respirator...

8
00:00:24,967 --> 00:00:27,763
keeping these marginal,
brain-dead relationships alive.

9
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:32,499
We do it so when we come home,
you can see the little flashing red light.

10
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,302
You go, "All right, messages."

11
00:00:34,377 --> 00:00:36,468
You see, people need that.

12
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:39,945
It's very important for human beings
to feel popular and well-liked...

13
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:42,550
amongst a large group of people
we don't care for.

14
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,389
Well, this is it.

15
00:00:53,463 --> 00:00:55,224
Oh, this is nice.

16
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:58,196
- Thanks again for the Chinese food.
- Oh, you're welcome.

17
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,131
- I think I ate too much of that garlic.
- Me too.

18
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:05,137
I ate the whole plate. I didn't know.
I thought they were peanuts.

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,547
You know what, I think Naked Gun
is on. Oh, I've seen it.

20
00:01:13,649 --> 00:01:15,876
I laughed through that whole thing.
Wanna watch?

21
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,451
No.

22
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:20,312
- I mean, I don't think so.
- I thought you liked to laugh.

23
00:01:20,389 --> 00:01:21,956
I thought you were
happy-go-lucky.

24
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:27,152
No, no. I'm not happy,
I'm not lucky, and I don't go.

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,455
If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,801
That's not funny, Naomi.
I didn't mean to be funny there.

27
00:01:34,237 --> 00:01:38,068
Why don't you check the TV Guide?
I think Holocaust is on.

28
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:45,538
Jerry, it's George. You all set for the
weekend? This is gonna be great.

29
00:01:45,615 --> 00:01:47,376
You'll have a great time with Naomi.

30
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,347
All right, she's got that laugh.

31
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:52,851
What'd you say, it's like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

32
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:55,455
I was thinking we'd take two cars
up to the cabin.

33
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:57,889
That way, you know, if one of us
wanted to stay...

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:03,728
This thing has never worked right.

35
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,502
You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?

36
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:11,265
Well, first of all, Elmer Fudd
is one of the most beloved...

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,773
internationally known
cartoon characters of all time.

38
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,502
"I'm gonna kill that cwazy wabbit."

39
00:02:17,246 --> 00:02:22,147
Come on! Not only that, a juicer
is one of the healthiest ways...

40
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:26,948
It makes juice, it extracts the pulp
and... And then the vitamins.

41
00:02:27,023 --> 00:02:31,219
For long life and vitality.

42
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:34,888
How could you leave
a message like that?

43
00:02:34,964 --> 00:02:36,793
How could you play it to just anyone?

44
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:38,331
I didn't think you'd leave it.

45
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:41,732
- I didn't think you'd play it.
- Now she's not coming this weekend.

46
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:44,737
What do you mean, not going?
We got plans. Call her up.

47
00:02:44,807 --> 00:02:46,499
Ah, it's better anyway.

48
00:02:46,576 --> 00:02:48,769
I mean, really.
What was gonna happen?

49
00:02:48,844 --> 00:02:52,311
I'm a comedian. How can I go out
with a girl with a laugh like that?

50
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:56,143
It's like Coco Chanel going out
with a fishmonger.

51
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:02,113
You know, she's with all the perfumes,
and a fishmonger's a pretty bad smell.

52
00:03:05,695 --> 00:03:07,319
Well, maybe you should ask Elaine.

53
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,760
But if I ask Elaine,
Kramer will feel slighted.

54
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:13,629
Oh, no, no. Don't say anything
to Kramer. Susan can't stand him.

55
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:16,328
He vomited all over her.

56
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:20,141
Wait a minute. Do you smell smoke?

57
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:23,039
- Ah, Kramer.
- Hello, boys.

58
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:24,873
Top of the morning to you.

59
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:26,776
What do you say? What do you be?

60
00:03:27,116 --> 00:03:29,343
Put that thing out before you start
another fire.

61
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,008
You had to give him cigars.

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,384
So, what are you guys
doing this weekend?

63
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,291
- Ah, we're...
- Because I'm gonna be playing golf...

64
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,054
at the Westchester Country Club.

65
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:42,094
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?

66
00:03:42,164 --> 00:03:45,995
That's right, buddy.
It's private. It's very private.

67
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:50,837
I met the pro at the golf shop up on
49th Street. I gave him a Cuban...

68
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,997
and he invites me for a free round.

69
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:57,441
Then he says, anytime I lay one of
these on him, it'll be the same deal.

70
00:03:57,513 --> 00:03:59,103
- Wow.
- Isn't that beautiful?

71
00:03:59,181 --> 00:04:01,749
Man, I'm gonna be hitting
the links all weekend.

72
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,087
- Gee, that's... That's too bad.
- Yeah. Too bad.

73
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:09,551
- Why? What? What?
- Because we were just saying...

74
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,784
we were gonna ask you
to the country.

75
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,021
Susan's father has a cabin up there,
but all right.

76
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:16,960
They got any
golf courses up there?

77
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,397
No, no, no.

78
00:04:19,468 --> 00:04:21,832
- No, no, that's pie country.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:24,097
Yeah, they do a lot of baking up there.

80
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,468
They sell them by the road.
Blueberry, blackberry.

81
00:04:26,542 --> 00:04:28,837
- Blackberry, boysenberry.
- Boysenberry, huckleberry.

82
00:04:28,911 --> 00:04:31,104
- Raspberry, strawberry.
- Strawberry, cranberry.

83
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,907
Peach.

84
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,784
- I don't know.
- Come on, I don't wanna tag along...

85
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:41,514
with George and Susan.
With you, it's a better group.

86
00:04:41,857 --> 00:04:44,323
- What's that?
- Oh, it's an autographed picture...

87
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:47,587
for my dry cleaner. I never know
what to write on these things.

88
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,628
I hate doing this.

89
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,599
"I'm very impressed"?

90
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:58,096
You mean "pressed"
because it's a dry cleaner?

91
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,469
Yeah, see? That's why I hate it.

92
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,634
So come on, you wanna go?

93
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:06,771
Well, what about the sleeping
arrangements in the cabin?

94
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:12,985
Well... Same bed,
and underwear and a T-shirt.

95
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:16,556
- What about me?
- Well, you'd be naked, of course.

96
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:21,792
- Excuse me. Jerry Seinfeld?
- Yeah.

97
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:25,695
My names Sanger, Mel Sanger.
I drive that truck out there.

98
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:27,630
- The Yoo-hoo?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,636
- I love Yoo-hoo.
- Yes, it's a fine product.

100
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,274
I saw you on The Tonight Show
a couple of weeks ago.

101
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:35,740
I was watching the show
with my son Donald.

102
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:38,744
He's got this rare immune deficiency
in his blood.

103
00:05:38,814 --> 00:05:42,748
The damnedest thing. Doctors say
he has to live in a plastic bubble.

104
00:05:42,818 --> 00:05:44,579
Can you imagine that? A bubble.

105
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:46,482
- A bubble?
- A bubble?

106
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,486
Yes, a bubble.

107
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:51,157
- Do you mind? May I?
- Oh, sure.

108
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:56,056
It'd break your heart
seeing him in there.

109
00:05:56,132 --> 00:06:00,191
He's like a prisoner.
No friends. Just his mother and me.

110
00:06:00,269 --> 00:06:03,566
And I'm out there six days
a week hauling Yoo-hoo.

111
00:06:04,473 --> 00:06:08,566
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...

112
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:10,939
bubble boy.

113
00:06:11,347 --> 00:06:14,473
- Excuse me.
- Oh, here.

114
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:25,660
Excuse me.

115
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:28,524
Anyway, we were watching
you on TV...

116
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,164
You get in the bubble with him?

117
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,527
No. He can see through the bubble,
it's plastic.

118
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,660
- Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
- No. It's clear.

119
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:38,530
Who has the remote?

120
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,140
He does.

121
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:42,209
The remote goes through the bubble?

122
00:06:42,278 --> 00:06:45,404
Yeah. He's in the bubble
with the remote.

123
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,776
So you have no control
over the remote?

124
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,884
No. It's frustrating.

125
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,044
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.

126
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:55,417
So anyway,
you're his favorite comedian.

127
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:57,252
He laughed so hard the other night...

128
00:06:57,326 --> 00:06:59,656
we had to give him
an extra shot of hemoglobin.

129
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,396
That's nice.

130
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:04,258
Tomorrow is his birthday.

131
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:08,563
And it would mean so much to him
if you could find it in your heart...

132
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,901
to pay him a visit and just say hello.
- Oh, well, tomorrow, I...

133
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:16,738
Jerry. Of course he'd pay him a visit.
You'd be happy to.

134
00:07:17,112 --> 00:07:19,612
Yeah. Okay...

135
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:22,945
Tomorrow. Where do you live?
Uptown? Up Westside?

136
00:07:23,285 --> 00:07:26,183
- No. Upstate.
- Upstate.

137
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:31,917
He's a bubble boy!

138
00:07:32,595 --> 00:07:35,926
- A bubble boy?
- Yes, a bubble boy.

139
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:39,363
- What's a bubble boy?
- He lives in a bubble.

140
00:07:39,702 --> 00:07:41,201
Boy.

141
00:07:44,073 --> 00:07:46,300
What kind of a bubble, like an igloo?

142
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:50,377
No, that's what I thought. It's
a piece of plastic dividing the room.

143
00:07:51,113 --> 00:07:54,410
What kind of plastic do you think it is?
Like that dry-cleaning plastic?

144
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:56,483
That's no good.

145
00:07:56,552 --> 00:07:58,847
He wouldn't last 10 minutes in there.

146
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,587
What can I do?
I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.

147
00:08:01,657 --> 00:08:03,622
It's his birthday.
I can't go to the cabin.

148
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:07,125
- Well, where does he live?
- I don't know. Upstate. Fall-something.

149
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,197
Wait a minute. This is right
on the way to the cabin.

150
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:14,427
Oh, all right. Beautiful. So you stop in,
visit the bubble boy for 20 minutes...

151
00:08:14,503 --> 00:08:16,230
then we can go.
- You think so?

152
00:08:16,305 --> 00:08:19,306
I know exactly where this is.
You can just follow us.

153
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,636
Oh, great. Okay, we're going away.

154
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,301
- I think I'm excited.
- I'm excited.

155
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,938
Oh, you're gonna love this cabin.
My grandfather built it in 1947.

156
00:08:28,017 --> 00:08:31,518
- It's incredible.
- There you go. It's a '47 cabin.

157
00:08:31,754 --> 00:08:34,550
- So we'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

158
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,723
Well, hey.

159
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,086
Very nice. Very nice.

160
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,393
- Well, I'm off to the links.
- Yeah.

161
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,361
I wanna thank you
for the invite upstate.

162
00:08:44,433 --> 00:08:45,761
I'm sorry I can't make it.

163
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,993
- The what?
- Nothing. Let's get going. Come on.

164
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,263
- Did you..?
- No, no, we'll talk about it later.

165
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:53,237
Is that one of the cigars
my father gave you?

166
00:08:57,179 --> 00:09:00,248
Hey, what's with George and Susan?
Does he actually like her?

167
00:09:00,316 --> 00:09:03,943
I don't know if he likes her
as much as he likes it.

168
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,743
Oh, that's nice.

169
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,980
What's he doing? What is his hurry?

170
00:09:08,057 --> 00:09:10,921
Oh, you know George.
He's gotta make "good time."

171
00:09:10,993 --> 00:09:14,790
He once went from West 81 st St.
To Kennedy airport in 25 minutes.

172
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:16,692
I never heard the end of it.

173
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,590
Look at him.

174
00:09:19,001 --> 00:09:21,228
Would you stop that, please?
Just stop that.

175
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,497
- Why?
- Knock it off. You're distracting me.

176
00:09:24,573 --> 00:09:26,800
We're making incredible time here.

177
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:31,935
I once made it to Kennedy airport
from West 81 St. in 15 minutes.

178
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:34,914
Oh, here. Hold this.
It's $10 for the tolls.

179
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,280
What's he doing?
Is he out of his mind?

180
00:09:37,553 --> 00:09:40,281
Do you see him? I don't even
see him anymore. Where is he?

181
00:09:40,723 --> 00:09:43,155
- Isn't that blue car him?
- No, no, that's not him.

182
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:46,419
What happened to him?
I can't believe it. I lost him.

183
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,085
That stupid idiot.

184
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:50,561
- Now what are we gonna do?
- It's no big deal, Jerry.

185
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:52,758
We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

186
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,960
I don't even know
where the bubble boy lives.

187
00:09:55,037 --> 00:09:57,401
I don't even remember the name
of the town.

188
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:00,098
- You don't have the directions?
- No, I was following him!

189
00:10:00,175 --> 00:10:02,004
How could you not take the directions?

190
00:10:02,077 --> 00:10:04,407
Because he's my directions.

191
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,817
I don't see them, George.

192
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,451
You make plans,
then he goes 100 miles an hour...

193
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:14,612
the weekend's over just like that.

194
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,519
Poor little bubble boy.

195
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:20,184
He's sitting there waiting for you
in his bubble or igloo thing, whatever.

196
00:10:20,262 --> 00:10:22,853
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where I am.

197
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:26,395
Just get off at this exit.
We'll figure something out.

198
00:10:27,403 --> 00:10:30,267
We lost them. Do you know that?
We lost them.

199
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,667
Well, it's not my fault.

200
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,502
Seinfeld can't drive.
How hard is it to follow somebody?

201
00:10:34,576 --> 00:10:36,735
Well, now what are you gonna do?

202
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,774
It's fine. We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.

203
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,107
Does he have the address?

204
00:10:48,724 --> 00:10:50,758
Yeah.

205
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,025
Leave a message,
I'll call you back. Thanks.

206
00:10:59,101 --> 00:11:01,635
Hi, Jerry. It's Naomi.

207
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:04,932
Listen, if it's not too late,
I changed my mind.

208
00:11:05,007 --> 00:11:08,167
- I'd like to go to the cabin.
- Wait. Wait.

209
00:11:08,243 --> 00:11:10,743
Yeah, hello. Hi.

210
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:12,673
This is Kramer.

211
00:11:12,848 --> 00:11:15,348
Yeah. I'm the next-door neighbor.

212
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:20,481
You know, Jerry's left, but listen,
you see, my golf game got canceled.

213
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:22,487
I'm thinking of going up myself.

214
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:25,991
They got pies,
and I got the directions right here.

215
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,532
I drive all the way
to the country club...

216
00:11:33,602 --> 00:11:36,227
and then I find out
there's a tournament going on.

217
00:11:36,638 --> 00:11:38,968
- You mind if I smoke?
- No.

218
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:40,733
These are Cubans.

219
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:54,485
I don't know if this is the house.

220
00:11:54,556 --> 00:11:57,022
I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.

221
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,559
Would you stop it?

222
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:03,254
Would you quit it, please?
Someone is gonna see us here.

223
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:05,093
So what?

224
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:07,633
You are such a prude.

225
00:12:07,703 --> 00:12:10,328
Hey. I am not a prude, sweetheart.

226
00:12:10,405 --> 00:12:13,201
I swing with the best of them.

227
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,443
- Come on, let's go in.
- What?

228
00:12:15,511 --> 00:12:18,910
We should tell them what happened.
They might be very late...

229
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:21,675
if they make it all.
- I can't go in there.

230
00:12:21,984 --> 00:12:23,551
I can't face the bubble boy.

231
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:28,318
- What's the matter?
- I don't react well to these situations.

232
00:12:28,991 --> 00:12:32,424
My grandmother died two months early
from how I reacted in the hospital.

233
00:12:32,494 --> 00:12:34,721
She was getting better.
Then I paid her a visit.

234
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,457
She saw my face, boom.
That was the end of her.

235
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:39,100
- We're going in.
- Wait, please...

236
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:42,135
- Come on, George. George, stop.
- Would you wait one moment...

237
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:48,266
I can't believe a little thing
like George speeding...

238
00:12:48,343 --> 00:12:51,674
and my whole weekend is gone.
The plans, the packing. Everything.

239
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,441
Your whole weekend?
What about the bubble boy?

240
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:56,481
Why do you keep bringing up
the bubble boy?

241
00:12:56,552 --> 00:12:59,416
You don't have to mention him.
I know about the bubble boy.

242
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,078
I'm aware of the bubble boy.

243
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:04,316
Why do you keep reminding me
about the bubble boy?

244
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:10,825
I'll have a cup of coffee
and a turkey club.

245
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:13,661
- How about you?
- I'll just have a glass of water.

246
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:17,504
You can't just have water.

247
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:19,698
Why not? That's all I want.

248
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:22,343
This isn't a park bench
where you come in and sit down.

249
00:13:22,411 --> 00:13:24,069
It's a business.

250
00:13:26,081 --> 00:13:27,773
Hold it a second.

251
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,508
Don't you play on TV?

252
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:34,180
- Oh, no.
- Yes. Yes, you saw him on TV.

253
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,682
- What's your name?
- Jerry Seinfeld.

254
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:39,884
- Elaine...
- Gary Seinfield.

255
00:13:39,962 --> 00:13:42,292
- I saw you on The Tonight Show.
- Right.

256
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:44,295
Wouldn't you like
an autographed picture?

257
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,595
I don't have any more pictures, Elaine.

258
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,135
He's lying. They're in the trunk.

259
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,138
- Now you get to sign another one.
- I'm not lying.

260
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:55,208
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

261
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,113
She'll have a cup of coffee
and a broiled chicken.

262
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,917
See, it's not really a bubble.

263
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:09,989
A lot of people think it's an igloo,
but it's really just a plastic divider.

264
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:22,064
Can you go in the bubble?

265
00:14:22,137 --> 00:14:25,434
Well, you have to put so many things
on because of the germs.

266
00:14:25,507 --> 00:14:28,337
The gloves, the mask,
it's a whole production.

267
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:30,608
So then he makes his own bed?

268
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:34,177
Well, that's one of the things
we fight about.

269
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:36,511
Would you like to meet him?

270
00:14:36,652 --> 00:14:39,585
- Ah, well, you know...
- Oh, he loves games.

271
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,846
Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit
with him.

272
00:14:42,124 --> 00:14:46,024
Hey, Ma! What the hell do I gotta
do to get some food around here?

273
00:14:46,228 --> 00:14:50,287
I'm starving. And if it's peanut butter,
I'm gonna shove it in your face!

274
00:14:57,973 --> 00:15:02,567
- One picture left in the trunk.
- Thanks. This is fun.

275
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,202
Yeah, this turned out to be
a great weekend.

276
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,938
Where's my water?

277
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:09,447
Oh, it's coming.

278
00:15:10,218 --> 00:15:12,252
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

279
00:15:12,621 --> 00:15:14,416
What'd you write?

280
00:15:14,489 --> 00:15:17,114
"Nothing's finer
than being in your diner."

281
00:15:23,665 --> 00:15:26,791
There is "nothing finer than being
in your diner"?

282
00:15:26,868 --> 00:15:29,960
- No good?
- This is what you came up with?

283
00:15:30,038 --> 00:15:31,628
Well?

284
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:33,536
That is so lame, Jerry.

285
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:37,474
People will be reading that for the
next 20 years and laughing at you.

286
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:40,644
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

287
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:42,841
Would you mind?
I'd like the picture back.

288
00:15:42,918 --> 00:15:45,452
- Why?
- I'm not happy with what I wrote.

289
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:48,555
- It's good. I like it.
- No, believe me, it's not good.

290
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:50,816
I'll mail you one with something
really funny.

291
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:53,756
Well, when you mail me a new one,
I'll send you back this one.

292
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:56,261
You don't understand.
I want the picture.

293
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,830
Right.

294
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,072
This is Donald.

295
00:16:08,143 --> 00:16:09,471
- Hi.
- Hello.

296
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:10,872
Who are you?

297
00:16:10,946 --> 00:16:13,537
- Where's Seinfeld?
- He's on his way.

298
00:16:13,615 --> 00:16:15,205
These are his friends.

299
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:17,179
What are you looking at?

300
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:19,946
Never seen a kid in a bubble before?

301
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:25,886
Of course I have. Come on.

302
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:28,859
My cousin's in a bubble.

303
00:16:29,664 --> 00:16:33,256
My friend Jeffrey's sister also,
bubble, you know...

304
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:36,062
I got a lot of bubble experience.
Come on.

305
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:40,671
- What's your story?
- I have no story.

306
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:42,969
She works for NBC.

307
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:45,511
How about taking your top off?

308
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,313
Donald, behave yourself.

309
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:51,111
Come on.

310
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:52,981
I know, I know.

311
00:16:53,055 --> 00:16:55,419
Why don't you play
a game of Trivial Pursuit?

312
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,421
Ah, you know, we gotta be running...

313
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,287
What, are you afraid?

314
00:16:59,961 --> 00:17:04,191
- No. You see, it's...
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

315
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,432
I was nice enough
to give you the picture.

316
00:17:07,502 --> 00:17:11,333
I don't like what I wrote. I don't want
it up there. Please just give it back.

317
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,408
You are really starting
to get under my skin.

318
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:17,238
- I want that picture.
- Well, you can't have it.

319
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:20,176
In fact, maybe you better
just pay your check, and get out.

320
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,407
I'm not paying until I get that back.

321
00:17:22,484 --> 00:17:24,449
Well, you ain't getting it back.

322
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,383
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.

323
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,691
This chicken is really good.

324
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:36,961
Okay, history.

325
00:17:37,032 --> 00:17:38,861
This is for the game.

326
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,167
How you doing over there?

327
00:17:41,403 --> 00:17:43,937
Not too good.

328
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,999
All right, bubble boy.

329
00:17:47,075 --> 00:17:49,166
Let's just play.

330
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:52,643
"Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?"

331
00:17:52,714 --> 00:17:54,907
That's a joke. The Moors.

332
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:57,176
Oh, no.

333
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,813
I'm so sorry. It's the "Moops."

334
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:02,183
The correct answer is the Moops.

335
00:18:02,257 --> 00:18:05,383
Moops? Let me see that.

336
00:18:06,528 --> 00:18:09,222
That's not Moops, you jerk.

337
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,661
It's Moors. It's a misprint.

338
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:15,234
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.

339
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:21,938
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.
There's no Moops.

340
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,441
- It's Moops.
- Moors.

341
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:28,873
- Moops.
- Moors!

342
00:18:32,787 --> 00:18:34,377
Hey!

343
00:18:34,756 --> 00:18:36,346
Anybody home?

344
00:18:38,126 --> 00:18:41,093
- Oh, boy.
- What should we do?

345
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:44,396
Hold these pies.

346
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:47,924
Okay.

347
00:18:56,711 --> 00:18:58,142
Help. Someone...

348
00:18:58,213 --> 00:19:01,407
- There's no Moops, you idiot!
- Stop it! Let go of him.

349
00:19:01,483 --> 00:19:04,746
Donald. Stop it.
Now, let go of him, Donald.

350
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,513
- I'm gonna kill him.
- He's choking me.

351
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:09,554
- Donald. Stop.
- Moors!

352
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:11,123
Say Moors!

353
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,817
Moops. Moops.

354
00:19:12,894 --> 00:19:14,928
Donald, stop it.

355
00:19:24,806 --> 00:19:26,931
What are you doing?
You're choking me. Elaine!

356
00:19:27,008 --> 00:19:30,168
- Are you gonna pay today?
- No, I want that picture back!

357
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:32,074
Something's happened
to the bubble boy!

358
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,010
- They're rushing him to hospital.
- What?

359
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,480
The bubble boy?
He lives around here?

360
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,084
That's his house, down the road.

361
00:19:38,153 --> 00:19:39,777
He got in a fight with some guy.

362
00:19:39,854 --> 00:19:42,252
Who kind of a person would hurt
the bubble boy?

363
00:19:42,324 --> 00:19:44,551
Some little bald guy from the city.

364
00:19:44,626 --> 00:19:49,060
Come on, Vern. Page, Preston, don't
you think we ought to do something?

365
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:53,458
Naomi, come on, let's get going.

366
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:55,603
But that lake must be freezing.

367
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,397
No, it's good for you.

368
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,665
Retards the aging process.

369
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,605
Ready to go swimming?

370
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:08,180
Let's go.

371
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,578
Okay.

372
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,290
Jerry, what happened to you?

373
00:20:20,362 --> 00:20:22,896
What happened to you?
You were going 100 miles an hour.

374
00:20:22,964 --> 00:20:24,793
I was not.
Bubble boy tried to kill me.

375
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,558
- What?
- Susan, tell them.

376
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:28,999
It's a long story.

377
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:32,668
- Hey, Seinfeld.
- Hey, happy birthday.

378
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,240
Thanks for showing up.

379
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:37,105
- You know, your friend tried to kill me.
- He's a lying snot.

380
00:20:37,178 --> 00:20:39,212
He's a cheater, aren't you,
little twerp?

381
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,712
- Moors!
- Moops!

382
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:42,917
- Moors!
- Moops!

383
00:20:42,984 --> 00:20:46,485
There's the guy who tried to kill
the bubble boy. Get him!

384
00:20:55,997 --> 00:20:58,088
Fire engines.

385
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:03,026
Must be a big one.

386
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:08,509
Do you smell something?

387
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,267
- Yeah.
- Smoke.

388
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:12,572
Yeah. Definite smoke.

389
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:15,243
Look, it's a fire!

390
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,084
Holy cow, look at that!

391
00:21:18,253 --> 00:21:21,845
- It's my father's cabin!
- The cabin is on fire.

392
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:27,861
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.

393
00:21:29,597 --> 00:21:31,858
How could this have happened?

394
00:21:35,103 --> 00:21:36,534
Oh, my God. The cabin.

395
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:38,069
What are you two doing here?

396
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:39,763
Look at that.

397
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:43,168
Hey, you didn't:

398
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,079
My Cubans.

399
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:51,483
Something very scary
and exciting about fire.

400
00:21:51,553 --> 00:21:53,120
People always run to see a fire.

401
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:56,121
They're very proud
if they have a fireplace.

402
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,657
I think that's what smoking
is really all about.

403
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:01,091
That's the power of smoking.
It's just this thing:

404
00:22:01,162 --> 00:22:03,628
"I got fire right here in my hand.

405
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:07,731
Smoke and fire is literally
coming right out of my mouth."

406
00:22:07,802 --> 00:22:09,961
And it's very intimidating
to the nonsmoker.

407
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,662
It's like talking to someone going:

408
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,899
"My head could open up.
Lava could explode out.

409
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:17,101
Pour right down my face.
Doesn't bother me a bit."

410
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,245
And a cigar is even worse.

411
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:20,938
I mean, a cigar is like:

412
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:25,643
You think this end is bad.
Look at this wet, disgusting nub, huh?

413
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,220
How scary is that?

414
00:22:29,305 --> 00:22:35,803
