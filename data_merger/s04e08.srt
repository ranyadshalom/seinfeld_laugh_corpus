1
00:00:00,569 --> 00:00:03,843
I don't think people think of their office
as a workplace. I think they think of it...

2
00:00:03,868 --> 00:00:06,304
as a stationery
store with Danish.

3
00:00:06,352 --> 00:00:08,647
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry...

4
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:10,880
your envelopes, your supplies...

5
00:00:10,956 --> 00:00:14,025
your toilet paper, six cups of coffee,
and you go home.

6
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:16,154
Why do people that work in offices...

7
00:00:16,228 --> 00:00:19,525
have pictures of their family
on their desk facing them?

8
00:00:19,665 --> 00:00:21,790
Do they forget that they're married?

9
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:24,800
Do they go, "5:00. Time to hit the bars
and pick up hookers.

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:26,961
Hold it a second.

11
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,767
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.

12
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:31,307
I completely forgot."

13
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:41,944
- She hasn't told her father yet?
- No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.

14
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:45,147
- "We're"? What do you mean, "we're"?
- Susan wants me to be there.

15
00:00:45,224 --> 00:00:47,622
You're meeting the father
for the first time?

16
00:00:47,693 --> 00:00:52,025
- Yeah.
- You'll make quite an impression on him...

17
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:54,791
when you tell him how
you burned his cabin down.

18
00:00:56,035 --> 00:00:58,467
I didn't burn it down. Kramer did.

19
00:00:58,537 --> 00:01:01,970
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.

20
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,167
The guy's nice enough to give you
a box of very fine Cuban cigars...

21
00:01:05,244 --> 00:01:06,811
- I know what happened.
- No, wait.

22
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,073
- Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
- I know.

23
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:14,413
Who proceeds to burn
the man's cabin down...

24
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:17,987
with one of those
very same cigars.

25
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:20,822
It's very comical.

26
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:23,661
Maybe we shouldn't
start writing today.

27
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,057
I got a lot on my mind.

28
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,494
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.

29
00:01:27,566 --> 00:01:29,634
I wonder how Susan's
father's gonna react.

30
00:01:29,701 --> 00:01:32,133
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.

31
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:33,532
Come on.

32
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:35,501
Not even a house. It's like a cabin.

33
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:37,266
We could build a cabin like that.

34
00:01:37,342 --> 00:01:40,070
Well, maybe not us,
but two men could.

35
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:43,478
BICs? What, did you get BICs?

36
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:45,549
What, you got a problem
with the pen, now?

37
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:47,514
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.

38
00:01:47,586 --> 00:01:50,120
All right, let's just get to work.

39
00:01:50,556 --> 00:01:52,817
NBC pilot. Seinfeld Project.

40
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:56,290
Act 1, Scene A.

41
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:59,191
So you're gonna sit there?

42
00:01:59,765 --> 00:02:01,127
Let me explain to you...

43
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,894
one of the key elements involved
in the writing process.

44
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:05,559
Because it may seem outwardly...

45
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:08,570
that the pen and the paper
and the chair play a large role.

46
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:14,209
But they're all somewhat incidental
to the actual using of the brain.

47
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:17,414
Okay, so just... Just park yourself.

48
00:02:17,483 --> 00:02:19,710
All right. Act 1, Scene A.

49
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:22,376
- Drink?
- No. No drink.

50
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:27,857
- All right. Here we go.
- Act 1, Scene A.

51
00:02:33,866 --> 00:02:36,799
- Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
- Yes.

52
00:02:43,308 --> 00:02:45,137
Hi, is Elaine there?

53
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,902
Oh, hi, Sandra.

54
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:49,007
Yeah, I can hold.

55
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:52,912
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat
with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.

56
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,280
Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen,
I'm at a pay phone.

57
00:02:55,354 --> 00:02:57,513
There's a lot of people
waiting to use it.

58
00:02:57,589 --> 00:03:00,487
I'll be off in a minute!

59
00:03:00,559 --> 00:03:02,524
Yeah, could you put me through
to Elaine?

60
00:03:02,594 --> 00:03:05,060
Okay, thanks.

61
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,225
Are you thinking of ideas?

62
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,329
Is there any way I can
get you directly?

63
00:03:10,402 --> 00:03:14,029
Every time I call, Sandra bends
my ear for, like, 20 minutes.

64
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:15,434
So we're on for later?

65
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,802
Yeah, I'll come by after work.

66
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,809
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing
happening here.

67
00:03:22,047 --> 00:03:23,375
I gotta go. I gotta go.

68
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,379
Sandra? Sandra?

69
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,983
Can you come here for a second?

70
00:03:27,619 --> 00:03:29,152
- Okay. Let's go.
- Here we go.

71
00:03:29,221 --> 00:03:31,380
- You got it? Here we go.
- Yeah.

72
00:03:32,391 --> 00:03:33,788
Okay, how about this:

73
00:03:33,859 --> 00:03:37,451
I'm in my apartment.
You come in.

74
00:03:37,529 --> 00:03:39,597
It's beautiful.

75
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:42,790
And what do I say?

76
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,299
Could you do me a favor?

77
00:03:51,376 --> 00:03:53,000
When my friends call...

78
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:56,142
could you not talk to them
for too long?

79
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,510
Why, did Jerry say something?

80
00:03:58,584 --> 00:04:00,174
No. No.

81
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:01,649
He must've said something.

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,185
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.

83
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:04,788
- I can't work for you.
- Oh, God.

84
00:04:04,856 --> 00:04:07,789
- I can't. I'm leaving.
- No, Sandra...

85
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:10,052
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.

86
00:04:10,128 --> 00:04:13,163
Listen, Jerry's under a lot
of pressure right now.

87
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:16,028
It's very hard being
a stand-up comedian.

88
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:19,034
Sometimes they don't laugh.

89
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,500
- All right, let's get going.
- All right, let's go to work.

90
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:25,973
- Let's go.
- Okay.

91
00:04:26,211 --> 00:04:29,109
- Hey.
- We're in the middle of something.

92
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,841
- We're trying to do a little work here.
- Yeah, come on.

93
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:33,314
What's with you?

94
00:04:33,385 --> 00:04:35,680
- No more golf.
- Why?

95
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:39,080
Remember I told you about the pro
at the Westchester Country Club...

96
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:42,192
who's letting me play every time
I gave him those Cuban cigars?

97
00:04:42,261 --> 00:04:45,194
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!

98
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:53,028
Hey, George, maybe you can
ask Susan's father for some more.

99
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:54,433
What are you, crazy?

100
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:57,871
I can't ask the guy for more cigars
after you burned down his cabin.

101
00:04:57,943 --> 00:04:59,943
What's one thing got to do
with another?

102
00:05:00,946 --> 00:05:02,274
Kramer, please.

103
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:04,642
Well, I can't go back
to the public courses now.

104
00:05:04,716 --> 00:05:07,216
I can't. I won't.

105
00:05:07,286 --> 00:05:09,581
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.

106
00:05:09,655 --> 00:05:11,985
The grass has
big brown patches in it.

107
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,522
They don't rake the sand traps.

108
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:16,661
Not to mention the caliber of people
you have to play with.

109
00:05:16,995 --> 00:05:20,064
I can't help you. You're gonna have to
get them someplace else.

110
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:22,223
Where? They're Cubans.

111
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,661
- You know what? I should take off.
- What?

112
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:28,601
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house
for dinner.

113
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:31,470
I wanna shower first,
and I wanna leave plenty of time.

114
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:33,770
You got four hours.
What about the script?

115
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,942
I think we got a bite on it.

116
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,412
Doesn't George look like
your sister Sara?

117
00:05:47,726 --> 00:05:49,521
A slight resemblance.

118
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:52,228
Her son's a podiatrist, you know.

119
00:05:52,564 --> 00:05:56,794
Oh, I have tremendous respect
for people who work with feet.

120
00:05:56,868 --> 00:05:59,801
I mean, to dedicate yourself
to the foot...

121
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:04,166
You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean...

122
00:06:06,678 --> 00:06:08,769
How are you enjoying those cigars
I gave you?

123
00:06:09,781 --> 00:06:12,349
Oh, the cigars.

124
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:15,111
I'm sucking them down.

125
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:17,778
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.

126
00:06:17,856 --> 00:06:20,288
You know, those cigars
are made special for Castro.

127
00:06:21,193 --> 00:06:23,386
I did not know that.

128
00:06:23,462 --> 00:06:24,859
Weird. Wild.

129
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:29,998
- What?
- He's doing Johnny Carson, Daddy.

130
00:06:30,202 --> 00:06:32,031
I didn't care much for his jokes.

131
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:36,172
- Daddy never laughs.
- Oh, well, so what?

132
00:06:36,241 --> 00:06:38,332
Laughter. What is that?

133
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,037
I mean, what is the point
of opening your mouth and going:

134
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:45,143
What is that?

135
00:06:47,586 --> 00:06:49,847
You know, you can't get
those cigars anywhere.

136
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:52,717
You and your cigars.

137
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,189
Wear some more lipstick.

138
00:06:57,863 --> 00:07:01,296
Daddy, there's... There's something
that we have to talk to you about.

139
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:04,560
Oh, I forgot to ask you:
how'd you like the cabin?

140
00:07:05,103 --> 00:07:07,501
Oh, the... The cabin.

141
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,333
Well...

142
00:07:12,811 --> 00:07:14,640
After we get off the phone
you tell her?

143
00:07:14,713 --> 00:07:16,804
Of course she knows it was me
who complained.

144
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:18,916
Now I'm responsible
for this woman quitting.

145
00:07:18,984 --> 00:07:22,178
- Oh, this is unbelievable.
- I know.

146
00:07:22,254 --> 00:07:25,084
I screwed up. It's all my fault.

147
00:07:25,157 --> 00:07:28,192
- Would you call her?
- Oh, dial the number.

148
00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:32,919
How could you do this?

149
00:07:32,998 --> 00:07:35,123
I was just trying to help you.

150
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,098
Trying to help me.

151
00:07:39,037 --> 00:07:40,832
Hello. Sandra.

152
00:07:40,906 --> 00:07:42,633
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.

153
00:07:42,707 --> 00:07:46,265
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.

154
00:07:46,344 --> 00:07:48,241
See, I told Elaine...

155
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:51,541
that it was a real treat
talking to you on the phone.

156
00:07:51,616 --> 00:07:55,049
And she thought I was being sarcastic
because I'm a comedian, and all.

157
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,656
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a
real treat talking to her on the phone."

158
00:07:58,723 --> 00:08:02,020
But I was really being sincere.

159
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:04,593
No, of course I like you.

160
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,825
Tonight?

161
00:08:10,335 --> 00:08:11,663
Hold on a second.

162
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:14,100
- She wants to have a drink with me.
- Just go. Go.

163
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:15,967
- Oh, I don't...
- Go.

164
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:18,439
Yeah, I think I can.

165
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:20,905
Yeah, I know where that is.

166
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,674
Okay. I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.

167
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:26,840
Now I gotta have a drink with her.

168
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:28,815
The cabin.

169
00:08:29,488 --> 00:08:31,078
Well...

170
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:34,523
Susan?

171
00:08:34,593 --> 00:08:37,093
- About the cabin...
- I love that place.

172
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:40,857
My father built that cabin in 1947.

173
00:08:40,932 --> 00:08:44,433
My mother was recuperating
from impetigo at the time...

174
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:48,437
and Dad thought it would be a good
idea to get her out into the fresh air.

175
00:08:48,507 --> 00:08:50,302
She died there the following winter.

176
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:55,608
And Dad passed away
10 years later to the day.

177
00:08:56,715 --> 00:08:59,283
His last words to me were:

178
00:08:59,718 --> 00:09:02,116
"Cherish the cabin."

179
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:09,182
Not, "Take care of your sister."
She's a paraplegic.

180
00:09:10,695 --> 00:09:14,060
But, "Cherish the cabin."

181
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:17,395
And I have, for 45 years.

182
00:09:17,636 --> 00:09:21,832
It's often been a sanctuary for me.

183
00:09:22,607 --> 00:09:25,403
Kind of like Superman's
Fortress of Solitude.

184
00:09:25,977 --> 00:09:27,738
What?

185
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:29,703
Superman.

186
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:32,816
He built a Fortress of Solitude
up at the North Pole...

187
00:09:32,884 --> 00:09:36,317
to, you know, sort of
get away from it all.

188
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,981
When I go, I'm passing it on to her.

189
00:09:40,058 --> 00:09:44,618
Well, I'll take a hotel any day.

190
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,161
- Daddy?
- Yes.

191
00:09:46,231 --> 00:09:48,561
Daddy, about the cabin.

192
00:09:49,134 --> 00:09:52,795
Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me.

193
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:55,838
- What about it?
- Well, the thing is...

194
00:09:55,907 --> 00:09:59,408
- What, what is it?
- Well, the cabin is kind of...

195
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:02,239
- George?
- Burned.

196
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:06,649
- Burned?
- There was a fire, and it...

197
00:10:06,718 --> 00:10:08,251
Burned.

198
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:12,984
- The cabin burned?
- Yeah, burned.

199
00:10:13,058 --> 00:10:15,922
Burned?

200
00:10:15,994 --> 00:10:17,322
Was anything found?

201
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:20,521
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?

202
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:23,361
- No. Nothing.
- Nothing?

203
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,334
But, you know, Mr. Ross,
if you look at the whole situation...

204
00:10:28,406 --> 00:10:31,066
what with it being your cigars
and everything...

205
00:10:31,142 --> 00:10:33,107
it's really rather ironic.

206
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:36,372
One might even say,
in a sense, comical.

207
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,481
Really. Think about it.

208
00:10:41,553 --> 00:10:44,213
- I can't believe you said that.
- What?

209
00:10:44,289 --> 00:10:46,619
How could you say
something like that to me?

210
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:49,225
What? You were the one
who was talking dirty.

211
00:10:49,294 --> 00:10:50,793
I was just trying to keep up.

212
00:10:50,862 --> 00:10:54,693
- That was a weird thing to say.
- Why? It didn't mean anything.

213
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:57,391
I was trying to join in
so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.

214
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:01,733
- Oh, I think you're really sick.
- I'm not sick.

215
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,931
You said much sicker things
than me.

216
00:11:04,876 --> 00:11:06,967
- I'm leaving.
- You're making too much of this.

217
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:08,373
Excuse me.

218
00:11:08,446 --> 00:11:10,537
- Let me walk you to a cab.
- That's okay.

219
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:13,115
The main thing is that this is
just between us.

220
00:11:13,184 --> 00:11:16,048
- And that'll be the end of it.
- Oh, really?

221
00:11:16,121 --> 00:11:18,883
I mean, people, they're not interested
in things like this.

222
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:21,548
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.

223
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,388
So we're drinking and talking.

224
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:29,931
And so she starts rubbing my leg.

225
00:11:30,001 --> 00:11:33,036
Wow, what did you do?

226
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:35,604
Have you ever told a woman
to stop touching your leg?

227
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:39,172
- Yeah. Right.
- I know it's the wrong thing to do.

228
00:11:39,244 --> 00:11:42,643
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.

229
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:46,181
I'm looking at the hand thinking,
"That hand should not be on my leg."

230
00:11:46,251 --> 00:11:50,082
But I can't make my brain to get
my mouth to say the words:

231
00:11:50,155 --> 00:11:51,722
"Would you mind?"

232
00:11:52,323 --> 00:11:55,722
Yet women have no problem getting
the hand off. How do they do that?

233
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:58,385
I don't know. They're working
on a whole other level.

234
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,393
- All right, so go ahead.
- So then we go back to my apartment.

235
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:06,533
So we're fooling around there.

236
00:12:06,604 --> 00:12:08,695
You know, it's getting
a little passionate.

237
00:12:08,773 --> 00:12:12,070
And she starts with the dirty talking.

238
00:12:12,143 --> 00:12:14,905
All right, all right. Hold on.

239
00:12:14,979 --> 00:12:17,070
Time out.

240
00:12:18,717 --> 00:12:22,719
- What did she say?
- You know. The usual.

241
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,912
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?

242
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:28,183
- Typical things.
- What's typical? Give me typical.

243
00:12:30,095 --> 00:12:32,561
She says...

244
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

245
00:12:47,178 --> 00:12:48,905
That's very dirty.

246
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,913
That's absolutely filthy.

247
00:12:51,983 --> 00:12:54,278
And then she starts talking
about her panties.

248
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:57,146
I'm gonna need some water here.

249
00:12:58,556 --> 00:13:00,248
So I said something.

250
00:13:00,492 --> 00:13:02,025
Okay, what did you say?

251
00:13:02,093 --> 00:13:05,185
Now, bear in mind,
I am just trying to keep up.

252
00:13:05,263 --> 00:13:07,490
- Of course.
- Okay.

253
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:10,896
So she's talking about her panties.

254
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:13,003
So...

255
00:13:13,738 --> 00:13:15,237
So I said:

256
00:13:15,306 --> 00:13:18,534
"You mean, the panties your mother
laid out for you."

257
00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:35,219
"The panties your mother
laid out for you"?

258
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,861
- What does that mean?
- I don't know.

259
00:13:39,631 --> 00:13:40,959
It just popped out.

260
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:44,295
- Well, how did she react?
- She flipped out. Just left.

261
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,902
Well, that's not offensive.

262
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,436
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.

263
00:13:48,506 --> 00:13:51,769
Look, the main thing is I don't want
Elaine to know about any of this.

264
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:53,672
I mean, especially the pantie remark.

265
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:56,746
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.

266
00:13:56,848 --> 00:13:58,575
What if this girl says something?

267
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,342
She will. She's going back to work.

268
00:14:00,418 --> 00:14:03,078
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.

269
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:06,053
So Susan's father took that news
pretty hard, huh?

270
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:08,852
Yeah. He went into the bedroom
and started sobbing.

271
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:11,996
- Guess he didn't see the humor in it.
- Yeah.

272
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,829
- Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.
- All right.

273
00:14:16,901 --> 00:14:19,231
- Big workday.
- That's right.

274
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:21,566
- Okay.
- Let's go.

275
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:22,967
- Right now.
- Let's do it.

276
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,836
- Okay.
- All right.

277
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:28,879
- What do you got?
- I got, you enter, you go, "Hi."

278
00:14:28,947 --> 00:14:30,947
And I go, "Hello."

279
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:35,185
Now, we need something here.

280
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:37,848
- Oh, hey.
- Kramer! Hey!

281
00:14:37,922 --> 00:14:40,422
- Buddy!
- You guys are working. I'll come back.

282
00:14:40,491 --> 00:14:41,990
- No, no! Come on.
- No, no!

283
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:44,320
No, you guys should
get back to work.

284
00:14:44,395 --> 00:14:46,986
- Don't leave. We're taking a break.
- Oh, yeah?

285
00:14:47,065 --> 00:14:49,827
George, did you talk to that guy
about getting more cigars?

286
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:52,160
I told you. I'm not gonna do that.

287
00:14:52,237 --> 00:14:54,498
Okay. Well...

288
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:58,005
I guess I'm just gonna have to
take matters into my own hands, huh?

289
00:14:58,076 --> 00:14:59,700
All right. I'll see you guys.

290
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:02,937
Where are you going?
Don't run off like that.

291
00:15:12,991 --> 00:15:14,786
Okay...

292
00:15:18,396 --> 00:15:21,431
- I need to talk to someone.
- Well, what is this about?

293
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:24,159
Well, it's a very private matter,
but extremely urgent.

294
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:27,097
- Are you an American?
- Oh, yeah.

295
00:15:27,171 --> 00:15:28,602
I see.

296
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:30,638
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

297
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:37,406
- Okay, let's get going.
- Let's get focused here.

298
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:41,279
Come on, now.
Come on, let's get it together.

299
00:15:42,353 --> 00:15:43,784
- Yeah?
- It's Elaine.

300
00:15:43,855 --> 00:15:45,786
Come on up.

301
00:15:48,526 --> 00:15:50,560
All right, you know what
we should do?

302
00:15:50,628 --> 00:15:52,855
We should go to the movies.

303
00:15:52,931 --> 00:15:55,226
- Get away from the script for a while.
- We should.

304
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,892
I just have to go over to the Rosses'
and drop off Susan's sunglasses.

305
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,300
- Come with me?
- Yeah. Does she live with them?

306
00:16:01,372 --> 00:16:02,700
No, no.

307
00:16:02,774 --> 00:16:06,935
- Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld.
- What?

308
00:16:07,578 --> 00:16:10,442
I just got a message from Sandra.
She's coming back to work.

309
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,682
Well, then you've just gotta fire her.

310
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,318
Don't even think about it.
There's no two ways about it.

311
00:16:15,586 --> 00:16:19,019
- Why, what happened? Did you talk?
- Talk? Did I talk? I...

312
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:22,023
You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.

313
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:24,320
I've concluded,
from the basis the those talks...

314
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:26,963
that this isn't anybody
you should be talking to.

315
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:29,497
- You really think I should fire her?
- Oh, yeah.

316
00:16:29,567 --> 00:16:33,797
In fact, if George and I weren't
so busy working, I'd do it myself.

317
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,515
What is your name, señor?

318
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:48,913
Kramer.

319
00:16:48,987 --> 00:16:52,113
So Señor Kramer,
what is this about?

320
00:16:53,658 --> 00:16:55,623
- Cigars.
- Cigars?

321
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,628
- Cigars.
- What about cigars?

322
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:00,892
See, here, I...

323
00:17:00,965 --> 00:17:03,260
I saved one of the cigar rings.

324
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:08,931
- You mean, one of these.
- Yeah, yeah. That's them.

325
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:12,907
Okay, so I'd like to buy
a couple of boxes of those from you.

326
00:17:12,977 --> 00:17:16,376
You realize, of course,
these are illegal in your country.

327
00:17:16,981 --> 00:17:18,878
Well, illegal, huh?

328
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:24,782
I like that jacket.

329
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,127
- Hi!
- Hi. How are you?

330
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,561
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

331
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:38,395
I thought you guys were
working today.

332
00:17:38,903 --> 00:17:40,800
- Just taking a little break.
- Yeah.

333
00:17:40,872 --> 00:17:43,964
- Oh, here's your sunglasses.
- Oh, thanks. Come on in for a second.

334
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:47,471
This is my brother Ricky. He's home
from college for the weekend.

335
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:49,613
Hey, there, young fella.

336
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,645
- What's your major?
- I don't have one.

337
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,081
Well, you should always
consider podiatry.

338
00:17:54,352 --> 00:17:56,010
Nothing wrong with the feet.

339
00:17:56,087 --> 00:17:57,745
And this is my aunt, Sara.

340
00:17:59,123 --> 00:18:00,986
He doesn't look like me.

341
00:18:02,627 --> 00:18:04,922
Sara, what do you have
on your wheels?

342
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:06,961
Nothing. They're clean.

343
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:08,860
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?

344
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:12,469
- Yes.
- Well, they're filthy.

345
00:18:13,538 --> 00:18:16,471
It's just a matter
of common courtesy.

346
00:18:17,642 --> 00:18:21,576
You come in the house,
you wipe your wheels.

347
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,545
Excuse me.

348
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:26,344
Hello, Raymond.

349
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:28,815
The man from the insurance company
dropped this off.

350
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,682
Said it was the only thing left
from the remains of the fire.

351
00:18:31,756 --> 00:18:33,790
Oh, thank you.

352
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:36,952
Wow, I've never seen this before.

353
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:38,390
Oh, they're letters.

354
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:40,993
- Here.
- Oh, sure.

355
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:46,265
From... From John Cheever!

356
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,164
"Dear Henry...

357
00:18:51,242 --> 00:18:54,072
last night with you was bliss.

358
00:18:54,145 --> 00:18:56,213
I fear my...

359
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:00,981
orgasm has left me a cripple.

360
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:04,679
I don't know how I shall ever
get back to work.

361
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:08,256
I love you madly, John.

362
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:11,819
P.S. Loved the cabin."

363
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,367
- Well, we really should be...
- Yeah, look at the time.

364
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:22,131
Heading out.
You know, it's a time...

365
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:23,933
The box!

366
00:19:24,008 --> 00:19:25,632
My letters! Give me that!

367
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,473
Who told you to open it?

368
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:30,011
Who's John? Who's John?!

369
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:32,081
- I knew it.
- I wanna know who John is!

370
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,514
John Cheever? Dad!
You and John Cheever?

371
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:38,587
Yes. Yes, he was the most
wonderful person I've ever known.

372
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:41,154
And I loved him deeply.

373
00:19:41,325 --> 00:19:44,019
In a way you could
never understand.

374
00:19:51,469 --> 00:19:54,367
Well, we really should be
heading out.

375
00:19:54,438 --> 00:19:56,563
Jerry hates to miss
the coming attractions.

376
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:58,800
- Yeah, and because of the time.
- Yeah.

377
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:02,139
Time is what he's indicating there.

378
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:06,079
Anyway, onward and upward.

379
00:20:09,086 --> 00:20:10,414
- Here we go.
- Let's go.

380
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:11,953
- Come on, now.
- Right now.

381
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:14,057
- You and me. No fooling.
- You got it.

382
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,160
- All right, what do you got?
- I got, you come in, you say, "Hi."

383
00:20:17,228 --> 00:20:19,728
And then I say, "Hello."

384
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:22,965
- All right. So we need something.
- Yeah.

385
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:26,664
How about this:
I say, "How's it going?"

386
00:20:27,772 --> 00:20:30,807
"How's it going?" Beautiful.

387
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:33,840
- Come on. We were just on a roll now.
- All right.

388
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:35,842
- Did you get that line?
- "How's it going?"

389
00:20:35,913 --> 00:20:38,880
- Did you write it down?
- I'm writing it. "How's it going?"

390
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,411
- Real good!
- What?

391
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:44,915
You know how much money
you cost me today? $429.

392
00:20:44,989 --> 00:20:47,557
- What, how?
- I got Sandra transferred...

393
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,488
to another office upstairs, okay.

394
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,720
So she blabs to Lippman about
my long-distance calls to Europe!

395
00:20:52,797 --> 00:20:56,264
- What calls?
- I made a friend when I was in Europe.

396
00:20:56,334 --> 00:20:59,597
And we've been in touch,
and Sandra told Lippman!

397
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:02,065
Did she say anything else to you?

398
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,135
Anything else? What do you mean,
"anything else"?

399
00:21:05,309 --> 00:21:07,104
So she just left the office...

400
00:21:07,178 --> 00:21:10,111
didn't say a word to you
about anything?

401
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:13,849
- Yeah.
- Beautiful.

402
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:16,680
Why is that beautiful?

403
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,344
Oh, no. Not beautiful.

404
00:21:18,422 --> 00:21:20,183
It's $429!

405
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:22,292
Hey, look, I'm gonna pay for that.

406
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,985
- No, no.
- No, I insist.

407
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:27,392
I was the one that encouraged you
to fire her.

408
00:21:27,465 --> 00:21:29,294
- The whole thing was all my...
- Okay.

409
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:31,025
Fault.

410
00:21:31,102 --> 00:21:33,295
Do you smell smoke?

411
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:40,139
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you
to meet my new friends here.

412
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:43,144
This is Luis, Jorge and Umberto.

413
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:45,509
- Hey.
- How you doing? Nice to meet you.

414
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:48,413
Yeah, we're heading up
to Westchester. Gonna hit the links.

415
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:51,282
- Yeah.
- Hey, isn't that your..?

416
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:53,389
Oh, yeah. Okay. We're going.
All right.

417
00:22:01,465 --> 00:22:02,793
Hey, what are you reading?

418
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,531
The Falconer, by John Cheever.
It's really excellent.

419
00:22:07,138 --> 00:22:09,866
John Cheever. You ever read
any of his stuff?

420
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,532
Yeah, I'm familiar with
some of his writing. You know.

421
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,813
Look, we gotta get back to work.
We just had a big breakthrough.

422
00:22:18,883 --> 00:22:20,814
- Okay. I'll leave you two alone.
- Okay.

423
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:22,213
Maybe I'll visit my mother.

424
00:22:22,286 --> 00:22:26,982
She just bought me some new panties,
and they're all laid out for me.

425
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,663
There's this whole
talking-during-sex business.

426
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:45,502
I mean, what are we doing here?

427
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:47,438
The question is...

428
00:22:47,511 --> 00:22:49,806
does the talking really
improve the sex?

429
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,470
Or is the sex act now...

430
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:54,049
just there to spice up
the conversation?

431
00:22:54,185 --> 00:22:57,686
Eventually, I'm sure people will get
too lazy even for phone sex.

432
00:22:57,755 --> 00:23:00,585
They'll start having
phone machine sex.

433
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:04,791
"Yeah, I want you really bad.
Just leave it on the tape."

434
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:09,298
Then, I guess, the phone company
will come out with sex-waiting.

435
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,332
That'll be the new thing.

436
00:23:11,402 --> 00:23:13,527
"Yeah, hold on, honey.
I got another call.

437
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:15,001
Oh, hi, baby. One second.

438
00:23:15,072 --> 00:23:18,005
Honey, I've gotta take this.

439
00:23:18,075 --> 00:23:20,234
Yeah, I've got sex-waiting
on the other line...

440
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:22,504
and I've got to take this."
