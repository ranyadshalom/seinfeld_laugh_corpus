1
00:00:00,676 --> 00:00:04,300
You can't have adultery.
You commit it.

2
00:00:04,301 --> 00:00:08,219
You can't even commit adultery unless
you already have a commitment.

3
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:11,886
So you have to make the commitment
before thinking about committing it.

4
00:00:11,965 --> 00:00:13,828
There's no commit without the commit.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,401
Then, once you commit,
then you can commit the adultery.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,936
Then you get caught, get divorced,
lose your mind...

7
00:00:20,006 --> 00:00:21,596
and they have you committed.

8
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:26,734
You know, some people actually cheat
on the people they're cheating with...

9
00:00:26,813 --> 00:00:29,279
which is like, you know,
being in a holdup...

10
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:31,747
and turning to the robber
next to you and going:

11
00:00:31,818 --> 00:00:33,909
"All right, give me everything
you have too."

12
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:41,393
You met her
at the supermarket? How?

13
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:44,121
Produce section.
Very provocative area.

14
00:00:44,197 --> 00:00:47,266
Lots of melons and shapes.
Everyone squeezing and smelling.

15
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:48,832
It just happened.

16
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:51,026
- So when you gonna see her?
- Tonight.

17
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,640
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

18
00:00:54,707 --> 00:00:57,776
- How could you not know her name?
- I was nervous. I got distracted.

19
00:00:57,844 --> 00:01:00,504
It had something to do
with a car or a fish.

20
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:05,951
Look at... Why do I get bananas?
They're good for one day.

21
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:08,744
Oh, my God. I forgot to tell you.

22
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:11,481
I got a letter today from
the State Controller's Office.

23
00:01:11,557 --> 00:01:13,249
Back in public school in Brooklyn...

24
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:15,951
every week I put 50 cents
in the Lincoln Savings Bank.

25
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:18,620
- Yeah, I did that too.
- Remember the little bankbook?

26
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:22,427
I haven't put anything in it since sixth
grade. I completely forgot about it.

27
00:01:22,502 --> 00:01:24,900
The State Controller's Office
tracks me down.

28
00:01:24,971 --> 00:01:27,301
The interest has accumulated
to $1900.

29
00:01:27,373 --> 00:01:29,805
Nineteen hundred dollars.
They're sending me a check.

30
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:32,504
Yeah. Interest. It's an amazing thing.

31
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:35,912
You make money
without doing anything.

32
00:01:35,982 --> 00:01:39,313
I have some friends that try and base
their whole life on that principle.

33
00:01:39,385 --> 00:01:42,477
- Really? Who?
- Nobody you know.

34
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:45,649
Maybe I'll go down to the track,
put it all on a horse.

35
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,918
Why don't you put it in the bank.

36
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:50,392
Bank? This is found money.

37
00:01:50,463 --> 00:01:52,827
I want to parlay it.
I wanna make a big score.

38
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:55,332
You mean you wanna lose it.

39
00:01:56,335 --> 00:01:59,927
Yeah. All right.

40
00:02:02,008 --> 00:02:03,575
- You got it, huh?
- Yes, I did.

41
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:05,677
- Yes.
- What's with the gloves?

42
00:02:05,745 --> 00:02:09,212
Well, I'm staining my floors. You know,
I don't wanna get my hands dirty.

43
00:02:09,282 --> 00:02:11,680
- What, the whole apartment?
- The whole apartment.

44
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,978
And I'm buying
that fake-wood wallpaper.

45
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:17,554
I'm gonna surround myself
in wood.

46
00:02:17,623 --> 00:02:20,089
It's gonna be like a log cabin.

47
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:22,921
Because I need wood around me.

48
00:02:22,995 --> 00:02:26,360
Wood, Jerry. Wood.

49
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,295
- Wood is good.
- Definitely.

50
00:02:28,367 --> 00:02:30,594
So we're still going to play
racquetball, right?

51
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,603
- Yeah. Whenever you're ready.
- Okay. Soon as Elaine gets here.

52
00:02:34,574 --> 00:02:36,904
- What, you rented Home Alone?
- Yeah.

53
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,574
- I thought you saw that.
- No, I saw Home Alone 2.

54
00:02:39,645 --> 00:02:42,543
Oh, right. But you hated it.

55
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:45,843
Well, I was lost.
I never saw the first one.

56
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:49,210
- By the way, you mind if I watch it here?
- What for?

57
00:02:49,288 --> 00:02:52,323
If I watch it at my apartment,
I feel like I'm not doing anything.

58
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:55,392
If I watch it here, I'm out of the house,
I'm doing something.

59
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:57,722
All right, go ahead.

60
00:02:58,898 --> 00:03:01,193
- Yeah?
- It's me. Are you ready to go?

61
00:03:01,267 --> 00:03:03,528
No. Come on up.

62
00:03:03,603 --> 00:03:05,330
I can't work with these.

63
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:09,534
- What's wrong?
- You bought me dishwashing gloves.

64
00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:12,143
- There's no fine touch.
- You said "gloves."

65
00:03:12,211 --> 00:03:14,745
No. No, these are too thick.

66
00:03:16,315 --> 00:03:18,246
- Is that Home Alone?
- Yeah. The original.

67
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:21,252
- Hey, boys-o.
- Hey!

68
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,321
Hello.

69
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,923
Hey, get your stuff. Let's go.

70
00:03:25,992 --> 00:03:27,992
Wait a minute.
There's a change of plans.

71
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,288
- What?
- Remember Roy, the artist?

72
00:03:31,364 --> 00:03:34,331
- Oh, the triangle guy.
- Yeah. Exactly. The triangle guy.

73
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,092
Yeah. You liked him.
What happened?

74
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:37,964
Yeah, I did. He was very talented.

75
00:03:38,037 --> 00:03:41,834
He was just, I don't know,
a little too...

76
00:03:41,908 --> 00:03:44,738
- Artsy?
- Fat.

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:46,810
He was a fat starving artist,
you know?

78
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,571
- That's very rare.
- Yeah.

79
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,239
Anyway, he's in the hospital,
he's having surgery...

80
00:03:51,317 --> 00:03:53,442
and I should go visit him.
- What's wrong?

81
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,179
Something with his spleen.
It'll just take five minutes.

82
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:58,050
Okay? The hospital's
right on the way.

83
00:03:58,124 --> 00:04:01,523
- All right. We'll wait for you.
- I can get some rubber gloves there.

84
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:05,496
Listen, Jerry, could you
do me a favor?

85
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:08,225
Could you go into the room
with me to visit him?

86
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:11,802
Because I don't want him to think
that I'm, you know, interested.

87
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:14,098
Oh, you want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend.

88
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:16,707
- Well...
- Well, I think I can do that.

89
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:19,401
I've played that role before
to some critical acclaim.

90
00:04:20,213 --> 00:04:21,780
- All right, let's go.
- All right.

91
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,107
- Yep.
- What's with him?

92
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:25,512
You know, a lot of people
have asked that.

93
00:04:31,924 --> 00:04:34,993
Roy.

94
00:04:35,061 --> 00:04:36,924
Elaine.

95
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:39,587
What a surprise.

96
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:41,995
Oh, my God.

97
00:04:42,068 --> 00:04:45,604
I hardly recognize you. You look so...

98
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:49,673
- Yeah, I've lost some weight.
- A lot of weight.

99
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:54,074
- I know.
- You look terrific.

100
00:04:54,146 --> 00:04:56,578
Thank you. So do you.

101
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:04,621
This is... You really lost weight.

102
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:08,351
- Thank you.
- Jerry. I'm the boyfriend.

103
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:16,192
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.

104
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,338
Dr. Whittenberg, outside call.

105
00:05:27,813 --> 00:05:30,177
The mother lode.

106
00:05:36,155 --> 00:05:39,122
I can't believe it. You were huge.

107
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:41,384
Like blubber.

108
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,391
I couldn't even get my arms
around you.

109
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:45,894
Yes. I remember.

110
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,590
Well, that's a positive thing
about getting sick.

111
00:05:48,668 --> 00:05:52,829
- You get to lose weight.
- Elaine, it wasn't the illness.

112
00:05:52,905 --> 00:05:55,064
- It was you.
- Me?

113
00:05:55,141 --> 00:05:59,337
Yeah. After you stopped seeing me,
I was devastated.

114
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,571
I couldn't eat for weeks.

115
00:06:01,647 --> 00:06:03,578
Get out!

116
00:06:07,086 --> 00:06:10,087
- Really. It's the truth.
- Jerry, did you hear this?

117
00:06:10,156 --> 00:06:12,520
He couldn't eat for weeks.

118
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:14,852
That's terrible.

119
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:19,894
I had no idea I had
that kind of effect on you.

120
00:06:19,965 --> 00:06:22,056
You did.

121
00:06:23,402 --> 00:06:26,369
You know, I can't get
this damn thing to sleep.

122
00:06:27,506 --> 00:06:29,198
Now, listen, Roy, tell me something:

123
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:32,435
- When are you getting out of here?
- Next Thursday.

124
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,102
Okay, I tell you what.
How about on Friday...

125
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:40,378
I take you out for a big meal,
because you are getting too thin.

126
00:06:40,453 --> 00:06:42,578
Honey...

127
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:49,952
aren't we going to
the Poconos next Friday?

128
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:52,859
No, that's the week after.

129
00:06:52,932 --> 00:06:55,262
No, I believe it's next week.

130
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,698
- You're wrong.
- No, I'm not.

131
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,495
Shut up.

132
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:05,142
Pay dirt.

133
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,676
Roy, this is Kramer.
He's one of our friends.

134
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,444
- How do you do?
- I do great.

135
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:16,086
- Hi, Roy.
- Hey, Dr. Siegel.

136
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:20,055
Hey, doc, check this out.

137
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:22,524
- Hey.
- I just learned that.

138
00:07:24,663 --> 00:07:27,129
I just wanted to stop by...

139
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,029
see if you had any questions
about tomorrow's operation.

140
00:07:30,102 --> 00:07:33,000
Yeah, yeah, I have...
I have a question.

141
00:07:33,072 --> 00:07:36,141
What do you know about
interabdominal retractors?

142
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:39,505
Are you asking because
you saw 20/20 last night?

143
00:07:39,578 --> 00:07:41,646
I sure am.

144
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:45,773
Well, that report was about
one very specific type of retractor.

145
00:07:45,851 --> 00:07:50,752
And I can assure you we do not use
that retractor in your friend's procedure.

146
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:54,086
But you will use a retractor.

147
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,591
We have to.

148
00:08:03,436 --> 00:08:07,529
I'll tell you what. You're obviously
concerned about your friend's welfare.

149
00:08:07,606 --> 00:08:10,504
A few of my students will be
observing tomorrow's operation...

150
00:08:10,576 --> 00:08:13,907
from the viewing gallery. How would
you like to watch it with them?

151
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,912
- I'd love to watch the operation, yeah.
- I don't know.

152
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,209
Come on, Jerry,
you gotta see the operation.

153
00:08:19,285 --> 00:08:22,650
They're gonna cut him open.
His guts will be all over the place.

154
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:25,519
- Yeah, that's true.
- They'll saw through bone.

155
00:08:29,161 --> 00:08:31,593
We'll see what's inside bone.

156
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,198
- Hey.
- Hi.

157
00:08:45,945 --> 00:08:49,981
- What are you doing? You're crying?
- No.

158
00:08:50,049 --> 00:08:52,174
You're crying from Home Alone?

159
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:56,880
- The old man got to me.
- All right.

160
00:08:56,956 --> 00:08:59,616
Get yourself together.
I don't know if I can be friends...

161
00:08:59,692 --> 00:09:02,955
with you anymore after this display.
- Oh, shut up.

162
00:09:05,498 --> 00:09:08,032
What are you doing back
so soon, anyway?

163
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,668
I never even got to the gym.
Kramer got the gloves...

164
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,532
wanted to come home
and start working on his floor.

165
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:15,674
- How's the guy?
- He's okay.

166
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:18,036
In fact, him and Elaine
are getting pretty chummy.

167
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:20,178
Now Elaine wants me to buy
some of his art.

168
00:09:20,246 --> 00:09:22,974
- That's nerve.
- Yeah. So she and triangle boy...

169
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:25,173
can go out to fancy restaurants.

170
00:09:26,352 --> 00:09:27,783
You know what it is?

171
00:09:27,853 --> 00:09:29,818
It's Clara Nightingale Syndrome.

172
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:33,049
- He falls ill, she falls in love.
- You mean Florence Nightingale.

173
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:36,456
- What did I say, "Clara"?
- You must have meant Clara Barton.

174
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:40,531
Clara Barton? What did she do?

175
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:44,825
I'm not sure,
but I think she was nice.

176
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:48,735
Susan B. Anthony I think
I'd have a problem with.

177
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:51,569
Yeah, I think you would.

178
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,143
So are you gonna buy his art?

179
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,405
No. Why don't you buy it.
You got $1900.

180
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,015
Yeah. That's what I want. Triangles.

181
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,310
I'm out of here.
Have fun with whatshername.

182
00:10:00,386 --> 00:10:02,010
I will.

183
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:05,054
You know, now you gotta ask her
her name. It's so embarrassing.

184
00:10:05,124 --> 00:10:08,625
- No, it isn't. I can find out.
- Yeah? How?

185
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:10,261
There are ways.

186
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:13,727
You know, I remember
when I was a kid growing up...

187
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:16,663
kids would make fun of my name
like you wouldn't believe.

188
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:19,770
"Jerry, Jerry, Dingleberry" and...

189
00:10:19,838 --> 00:10:22,498
- "Seinsmelled."
- Seinsmelled?

190
00:10:22,575 --> 00:10:24,233
Yeah.

191
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:26,742
What about you? Did people
make fun of your name?

192
00:10:26,812 --> 00:10:29,278
Are you kidding?
They were merciless.

193
00:10:29,348 --> 00:10:31,348
What do you expect
when your name rhymes...

194
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:34,008
with a part of the female anatomy?

195
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,352
Of course, not everybody can be
as sweet as you are.

196
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:52,670
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, you.

197
00:10:55,307 --> 00:10:57,773
Now, let's try "breast."

198
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,541
Celeste.

199
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:06,116
- Kest.
- No.

200
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:11,120
- Rest. Sest. Hest.
- Hest?

201
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,848
That's not a name.

202
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,721
- You should have just asked her.
- I know I should have asked.

203
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:18,692
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know. I can't ask her now.

204
00:11:18,764 --> 00:11:20,889
I've already made out with her.

205
00:11:20,966 --> 00:11:23,830
Once you make out with a woman,
you can't ask her her name.

206
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:25,765
Aretha.

207
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:30,532
No.

208
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:34,201
- Bovary.
- All right, that's enough.

209
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,447
You know what you gotta do?
You gotta go through her purse.

210
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:39,174
The credit cards, driver's license.

211
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:42,843
- Well, how am I gonna do that?
- When she goes to the bathroom.

212
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:45,019
- There you are.
- Hey.

213
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,680
My date stood me up.

214
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:49,692
Listen, will you guys go
to the operation with me?

215
00:11:50,896 --> 00:11:53,658
You asked a date
to go to the operation?

216
00:11:53,732 --> 00:11:55,129
Yeah.

217
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,631
So come on. What do you say?

218
00:11:57,336 --> 00:12:00,428
- What kind of operation is it?
- Splenectomy.

219
00:12:00,506 --> 00:12:02,972
- Isn't that where they remove the..?
- Don't ruin it.

220
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:05,076
I haven't seen it yet.

221
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:07,110
Now, come on. What do you say?

222
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:08,940
Mulva.

223
00:12:11,684 --> 00:12:13,376
Mulva?

224
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:15,543
Come on, come on. You wanna go?

225
00:12:15,621 --> 00:12:17,382
- Come on. Yeah.
- All right. All right.

226
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:19,353
Just let me finish my coffee.

227
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:22,983
Then we'll watch them go
slice this fat bastard up.

228
00:12:25,864 --> 00:12:29,161
Now we'll open
the peritoneal cavity...

229
00:12:29,234 --> 00:12:32,064
exposing the body's
internal organs.

230
00:12:32,304 --> 00:12:35,202
Nurse, retractor.

231
00:12:43,482 --> 00:12:47,211
- What are you eating?
- Junior Mints.

232
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,286
- You want one?
- No.

233
00:12:49,354 --> 00:12:51,445
Now, I can't see.

234
00:12:56,161 --> 00:12:58,161
Could you get..?

235
00:13:09,241 --> 00:13:10,899
Where'd you get those?

236
00:13:10,976 --> 00:13:12,566
- The machine. You want one?
- No.

237
00:13:12,644 --> 00:13:14,507
- Here. Take one.
- I don't want one.

238
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,307
- No, they're good.
- I don't want any.

239
00:13:16,381 --> 00:13:19,541
- Just take one.
- No. Stop... Kramer, stop it.

240
00:13:33,465 --> 00:13:37,057
- Did it go in?
- Yes.

241
00:13:42,341 --> 00:13:45,171
Over the balcony, bounced off
some respirator thing...

242
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:47,107
into the patient.

243
00:13:49,081 --> 00:13:51,240
What do you mean,
"Into the patient"?

244
00:13:51,316 --> 00:13:53,577
Into the patient. Literally.

245
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:56,585
- Into the hole?
- Yes.

246
00:13:56,655 --> 00:13:58,484
The hole.

247
00:13:58,557 --> 00:14:00,420
- Didn't they notice it?
- No.

248
00:14:00,492 --> 00:14:04,255
- How could they not notice it?
- Because it's a little mint.

249
00:14:04,329 --> 00:14:06,556
It's a Junior Mint.

250
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,731
Well, what did they do?

251
00:14:11,804 --> 00:14:14,270
They sealed him up
with the mint inside.

252
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,068
- They left the Junior Mint in him?
- Yes.

253
00:14:19,178 --> 00:14:22,076
Well, I... I guess it can't hurt him.

254
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:23,908
People eat pounds of those things.

255
00:14:23,982 --> 00:14:25,515
Yes, they eat them.

256
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:30,781
They don't put them next to vital
organs in their abdominal cavity.

257
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,155
- Yeah.
- It's me.

258
00:14:35,227 --> 00:14:36,726
Come on up.

259
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:38,385
Hey.

260
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:41,430
This wallpaper is very good.

261
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,693
My place looks like a ski lodge.

262
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:46,497
Why'd you force that mint on me?
I didn't want the mint!

263
00:14:46,572 --> 00:14:48,970
- What? I didn't believe you.
- How could you not?

264
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,837
Well, who's gonna turn down
a Junior Mint?

265
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,377
It's chocolate, it's peppermint.
It's delicious.

266
00:14:56,682 --> 00:14:59,979
- That's true.
- It's very refreshing.

267
00:15:00,052 --> 00:15:03,519
Well, just don't say anything
about this to Elaine.

268
00:15:05,924 --> 00:15:07,582
Prognosis...

269
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:09,556
negative.

270
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:11,821
Prognosis negative?

271
00:15:11,897 --> 00:15:14,431
He's not doing well.
The doctors don't know what it is.

272
00:15:14,499 --> 00:15:16,464
They're baffled.

273
00:15:16,535 --> 00:15:18,660
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

274
00:15:18,737 --> 00:15:22,398
Just my luck, you know? Just when
he was getting thin and attractive.

275
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,273
You know, Jerry, you should
buy some of his art.

276
00:15:25,344 --> 00:15:29,574
- That would really lift his spirits.
- It's that bleak?

277
00:15:31,049 --> 00:15:34,676
You know, if the guy dies...

278
00:15:34,753 --> 00:15:37,344
the art could really be
worth something.

279
00:15:37,422 --> 00:15:38,750
- We gotta confess.
- Really?

280
00:15:38,824 --> 00:15:40,516
- Yes.
- We could be tried for murder.

281
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:43,058
I can't have this on my conscience.
We're Leopold and Loeb.

282
00:15:43,128 --> 00:15:45,423
- You're not saying anything.
- You can't stop me.

283
00:15:45,664 --> 00:15:47,755
No, you're not!

284
00:15:49,902 --> 00:15:52,994
Hey, Elaine, put me down
for some of that art.

285
00:15:53,071 --> 00:15:55,332
Nineteen hundred dollars' worth.

286
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:01,610
Yeah, that's the spot.

287
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,372
What are you so tense about?

288
00:16:03,448 --> 00:16:06,881
Nothing, really. Just a homicide.

289
00:16:08,954 --> 00:16:11,022
That's terrific...

290
00:16:11,924 --> 00:16:13,685
Mulva.

291
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:23,093
What?

292
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:25,734
Mulva?

293
00:16:26,405 --> 00:16:28,439
Mulva?

294
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:29,869
My...

295
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,977
My aunt's name is Mulva.
She's a masseuse.

296
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:36,105
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

297
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,112
Good idea.

298
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,256
What are you doing?

299
00:16:49,895 --> 00:16:52,520
I was just looking for some gum.

300
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,494
- Or a mint.
- I have Junior Mints.

301
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,395
No! No. I mean...

302
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:59,066
No, thank you. No.

303
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:05,609
- Any news?
- No. No. You better get out of here.

304
00:17:05,677 --> 00:17:07,506
No, wait a sec. Wait a second.

305
00:17:07,713 --> 00:17:10,111
I don't know the name of
this woman in the bathroom.

306
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,375
So when she comes out,
you introduce yourself.

307
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:14,542
- She'll be forced to say her name.
- Ten-four.

308
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,482
Okay.

309
00:17:17,155 --> 00:17:19,655
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Kramer.

310
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:22,817
- Nice to meet you.
- See you later.

311
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:27,688
I'd better get going.
I don't wanna be late for the play.

312
00:17:27,766 --> 00:17:29,527
- Okay.
- My cousin knows the producer.

313
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,169
I may get to go backstage
and meet Olympia Dukakis.

314
00:17:32,237 --> 00:17:34,396
- There's a name you don't forget.
- Bye, Jerry.

315
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,063
Bye.

316
00:17:37,776 --> 00:17:39,707
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm George.

317
00:17:39,778 --> 00:17:43,780
- Nice to meet you, George.
- Yeah. I gave it a shot.

318
00:17:44,883 --> 00:17:47,781
So any word on the artiste?

319
00:17:47,853 --> 00:17:49,545
No. I haven't heard anything.

320
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:51,848
- Well, I got my triangles.
- Really?

321
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:54,514
Yep. You know, they really
spruce up the apartment.

322
00:17:54,593 --> 00:17:58,493
Yeah, I'm sure. I gotta call the hospital.
I gotta tell them what happened.

323
00:17:58,697 --> 00:18:00,697
- No, no. Jerry, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?

324
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,333
You could get in trouble.

325
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:04,230
Look, I gotta try and help the guy.

326
00:18:04,302 --> 00:18:06,893
Who are you to play God?!

327
00:18:06,972 --> 00:18:08,835
Every man's time comes.

328
00:18:08,907 --> 00:18:11,066
If his number is up,
who are you to interfere?

329
00:18:11,143 --> 00:18:13,609
Yes, I'd like to speak with Dr. Siegel.

330
00:18:13,678 --> 00:18:15,837
It's about Roy Corning's condition.

331
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:18,107
- What? What?
- That's fantastic.

332
00:18:18,183 --> 00:18:22,344
- He didn't get better, did he?
- Thank you very much. Okay. Bye-bye.

333
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:24,648
He's gonna be okay.

334
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:28,458
Where's the luck?

335
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,152
There's no luck.

336
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:34,492
Nineteen hundred dollars
down the drain.

337
00:18:36,902 --> 00:18:38,697
You saved my life, George.

338
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,168
You buying my art is what
inspired me to get better.

339
00:18:41,239 --> 00:18:43,273
I'll never forget what you did for me.

340
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:45,375
Well, that's great. It's really great.

341
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:47,902
You know, art's a great investment.

342
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,671
They'll be great in your apartment.

343
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:52,612
Yes, I look forward
to many years of...

344
00:18:52,684 --> 00:18:55,582
looking at the triangles.

345
00:18:56,455 --> 00:18:59,388
Well, I'll... I'll wait for you outside.

346
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:02,925
- Hey, George.
- Yeah?

347
00:19:04,796 --> 00:19:06,124
- All right.
- That's nice.

348
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:07,822
Thanks, Roy.

349
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:10,800
Hey.

350
00:19:10,869 --> 00:19:13,767
There's the guy who saved my life.

351
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,635
You know, I don't want
to totally discount...

352
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:19,709
the emotional element
in your recovery...

353
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:22,972
but I think there were
other factors at play here.

354
00:19:23,048 --> 00:19:25,582
- What do you mean?
- I have no medical evidence...

355
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,050
to back me up, but something
happened during the operation...

356
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:32,782
that staved off that infection.

357
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:35,586
Something beyond science.

358
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,728
Something perhaps...

359
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:39,625
from above.

360
00:19:42,167 --> 00:19:43,666
Mint?

361
00:19:43,735 --> 00:19:46,133
Those can be very refreshing.

362
00:19:50,475 --> 00:19:52,702
So Elaine...

363
00:19:52,777 --> 00:19:56,040
where we going for our
big dinner on Friday?

364
00:19:58,116 --> 00:19:59,410
I'm so sorry, Roy...

365
00:19:59,484 --> 00:20:02,951
but, actually, we are going to
the Poconos on Friday. Right, honey?

366
00:20:03,321 --> 00:20:05,252
I don't think so.

367
00:20:05,323 --> 00:20:07,914
Yeah, I believe that we...
We are.

368
00:20:07,993 --> 00:20:09,822
I believe we're not.

369
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:14,856
- Please, can we go to the Poconos?
- Well, I'll think about it.

370
00:20:16,301 --> 00:20:18,892
Great seats. You could see
the actors spitting.

371
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:20,298
Really.

372
00:20:20,372 --> 00:20:22,804
Afterwards, we went backstage,
and Olympia Dukakis...

373
00:20:22,874 --> 00:20:24,202
autographed my playbill.

374
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,774
- Wait a second. You got her autograph?
- Yeah.

375
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:31,006
- Do you have it with you?
- Yeah, it's in my purse.

376
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:33,343
Let me see.

377
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:37,318
You know, I really think I'm
falling for you, Jerry Seinfeld.

378
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:41,220
Well, I really think
I'm falling for you...

379
00:20:41,293 --> 00:20:43,884
"Joseph Poglia."

380
00:20:46,665 --> 00:20:48,630
I had it autographed for my uncle.

381
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,462
Yeah, I know.

382
00:20:51,536 --> 00:20:54,230
You don't know my name, do you?

383
00:20:55,006 --> 00:20:57,802
- Yes, I do.
- What is it?

384
00:20:58,276 --> 00:21:01,174
It rhymes with a female body part.

385
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:03,374
What is it?

386
00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:06,717
Mulva?

387
00:21:10,622 --> 00:21:12,485
Gipple?

388
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,554
Loleola?

389
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:32,366
Dolores!

390
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:45,415
Ages 0 through 10, candy is
your life. There's nothing else.

391
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,888
Family, friends, school,
they're only obstacles...

392
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:50,323
in the way of getting more candy.

393
00:21:50,395 --> 00:21:52,486
You have your favorite candies
that you love.

394
00:21:52,564 --> 00:21:54,928
You know, "I love those. I hate those.

395
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,295
I hate those. I love those."

396
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:00,063
Only a 7-year-old kid can actually
taste the difference...

397
00:22:00,138 --> 00:22:03,503
between, like, a red M&M
and a light-brown M&M.

398
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:06,610
That's two totally different things
when you're a 7-year-old.

399
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:08,939
"Well, your red is more of
a main-course M&M...

400
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:11,412
but the brown, it's a more
of a mellower flavor.

401
00:22:11,483 --> 00:22:14,552
It's an after-dinner M&M, really."

402
