1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,801
Don't visualize your parents
having sex.

2
00:00:03,873 --> 00:00:06,441
You know what I mean? It's somehow
very uncomfortable.

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,240
You know they had to have sex
at least once to have you.

4
00:00:11,315 --> 00:00:14,009
But you still kind of maintain
the image in your head:

5
00:00:14,084 --> 00:00:17,551
"Well, I don't know. I'm not positive.
I can't prove it.

6
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:19,518
I don't know if that
actually happened."

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,716
That's why if I found I was adopted,
that would come as great news.

8
00:00:22,793 --> 00:00:24,292
"I'm adopted? That's great."

9
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:26,794
I'd be happy to hear that.
That means technically...

10
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:32,028
it's possible, that my mother and
father are just really great friends.

11
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:35,138
Sex is great, but you don't wanna
think your whole life began...

12
00:00:35,206 --> 00:00:37,934
because somebody had a little
too much wine with dinner.

13
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,240
Let me ask you a question.

14
00:00:46,886 --> 00:00:48,715
You're a hostage captured
by terrorists.

15
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:50,788
- Who, me?
- You, anybody. Whatever.

16
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,721
You're in the little room.
You're chained to the floor.

17
00:00:53,794 --> 00:00:55,623
You're there for a long time.

18
00:00:55,695 --> 00:00:58,059
Do you think they would consider
doing laundry?

19
00:00:58,131 --> 00:01:00,165
They have to.
It's in the Geneva Convention.

20
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:03,131
You. Take off your socks
and pants. We're doing the wash.

21
00:01:03,203 --> 00:01:05,771
Come on. Take it off.
Take it off.

22
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:08,932
- Hey, Georgie.
- Hi.

23
00:01:11,145 --> 00:01:12,507
What's the matter?

24
00:01:14,715 --> 00:01:16,282
My mother caught me.

25
00:01:17,018 --> 00:01:18,585
Caught you? Doing what?

26
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:20,515
You know.

27
00:01:23,559 --> 00:01:26,059
I was alone...

28
00:01:26,895 --> 00:01:28,758
You mean..?

29
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:30,956
- She caught you?
- Where?

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,692
I stopped by the house
to drop the car off...

31
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,736
and I went inside
for a few minutes.

32
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:39,033
Nobody was there.
They're supposed to be working.

33
00:01:40,043 --> 00:01:44,273
My mother had a Glamour magazine.
I started leafing through it.

34
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:46,271
Glamour?

35
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,511
- So one thing led to another.
- What did she do?

36
00:01:50,588 --> 00:01:54,556
First she screams, "George, what are
you doing? My God!"

37
00:01:55,559 --> 00:01:57,126
Looked like she was gonna faint.

38
00:01:57,194 --> 00:02:00,229
She started clutching the wall,
trying to hang onto it.

39
00:02:00,297 --> 00:02:03,299
I didn't know whether to keep her
from falling or zip up.

40
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:06,363
- What did you do?
- I zipped up.

41
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:08,403
- So she fell?
- Yeah.

42
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,572
Well, I couldn't run over there
the way I was.

43
00:02:11,643 --> 00:02:14,234
- No, I guess you couldn't.
- I wouldn't think so.

44
00:02:14,312 --> 00:02:18,440
So she fell, and then she starts
screaming, "My back, my back!"

45
00:02:18,517 --> 00:02:20,585
I picked her up. I took her
to the hospital.

46
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:24,187
- How is she?
- She's in traction.

47
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:26,018
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny, Elaine.

48
00:02:26,092 --> 00:02:28,888
I know. I'm sorry. It's serious.

49
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:32,327
Her back went out. She's gotta be
there for a couple of days.

50
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:37,436
All she said on the way over
in the car was, "Why, George, why?"

51
00:02:37,504 --> 00:02:40,095
I said, "Because it's there."

52
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:43,499
Glamour?

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,911
I'll tell you this, though:

54
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,072
I am never doing...

55
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,047
that again.

56
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:53,710
What? You mean in your mother's
house or altogether?

57
00:02:53,788 --> 00:02:56,356
- Altogether.
- Give me a break.

58
00:02:56,424 --> 00:02:58,083
Yeah, right.

59
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:01,057
- You don't think I can?
- No chance.

60
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:05,063
- You think you could?
- I could hold out longer than you.

61
00:03:06,168 --> 00:03:08,202
Care to make it interesting?

62
00:03:09,305 --> 00:03:10,736
Sure. How much?

63
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,135
Hundred dollars?

64
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,741
You're on.

65
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:17,038
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Count me in on this.

66
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:20,805
You? You'll be out before we
get the check.

67
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,780
I want in on this.

68
00:03:23,853 --> 00:03:27,754
- No, no.
- It's apples and oranges.

69
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:29,256
- It's different.
- Why? Why?

70
00:03:29,327 --> 00:03:31,088
- Because you're a woman.
- So what?

71
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:35,062
It's easier for a woman not to do it
than a man. We have to do it.

72
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,894
It's part of our lifestyle.

73
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:40,461
It's like shaving.

74
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,774
That is such baloney.
I shave my legs.

75
00:03:43,842 --> 00:03:45,307
Not every day.

76
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,103
- You wanna be in?
- Yeah.

77
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:52,444
You gotta give us odds.
At least 2-1. You gotta put up $200.

78
00:03:52,517 --> 00:03:54,677
No. A thousand.

79
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:57,345
No. I'll put up 150.

80
00:03:57,423 --> 00:04:00,549
- All right. You're in for 150.
- Okay, 150.

81
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:02,023
How we gonna monitor this?

82
00:04:02,128 --> 00:04:04,856
Obviously, we all know each
other very well.

83
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:10,595
I'm sure we'll all feel comfortable within
the confines of the honor system.

84
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:13,873
All right. Come on.

85
00:04:18,412 --> 00:04:22,745
No, Ma. I'm not gonna
see a psychiatrist.

86
00:04:23,051 --> 00:04:25,517
I don't care if you do pay for it.

87
00:04:25,587 --> 00:04:27,621
No. Discussion over.

88
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:29,654
Yeah, all right. I'll see you later.

89
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:32,486
Yes, of course I'm gonna come by.

90
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,720
All right.

91
00:04:34,797 --> 00:04:37,798
My mother wants me
to see a psychiatrist now.

92
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:41,061
Why? Because she caught me?

93
00:04:41,137 --> 00:04:45,571
You know, if everyone who did
that had to go see a psychiatrist...

94
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:51,575
Yeah..?

95
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:53,548
Whatever.

96
00:04:57,154 --> 00:04:58,619
- How is she?
- She'll be fine.

97
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:00,380
I gotta go see her at the hospital.

98
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:01,683
- Yeah?
- It's me.

99
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:03,087
Come on up.

100
00:05:03,161 --> 00:05:05,991
- Hey, what are you doing tonight?
- Date with Marla.

101
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:08,155
- Oh, the virgin?
- Yeah.

102
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,901
Any progress there?
What's the latest?

103
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:13,263
I got my troops amassed
along the border.

104
00:05:13,337 --> 00:05:15,735
I'm waiting for someone to give me
the go-ahead.

105
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,436
Hey, look at this. Come here. There's
a naked woman across the street.

106
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:21,479
Where?

107
00:05:21,547 --> 00:05:24,047
Second floor from the top.
See the window on the left?

108
00:05:24,683 --> 00:05:27,513
Who walks around
the house like that?

109
00:05:27,586 --> 00:05:30,520
Maybe she's a nudist. You know those
nudist-colony people.

110
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,419
Yeah.

111
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:33,957
Yeah.

112
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

113
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:44,695
Let me ask you,
in these nudist colonies...

114
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:46,669
do they eat naked
in the dining room?

115
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,364
I would imagine it's all naked.

116
00:05:48,442 --> 00:05:50,271
Are the chambermaids naked too?

117
00:05:50,344 --> 00:05:53,379
They're naked. The gardener's naked.
Bellhops.

118
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,572
It's one big nude-o-rama.

119
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:59,615
- Hey.
- Hey.

120
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:02,313
Well, where's my money?
Who caved?

121
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,287
- Not me.
- Not me.

122
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:07,257
- What are you looking at?
- A naked woman across the street.

123
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,994
This is gonna be the easiest
money I've ever made in my life.

124
00:06:12,201 --> 00:06:15,464
My friend Joyce is teaching an
aerobics class. I'm gonna go tonight.

125
00:06:15,538 --> 00:06:18,505
Yeah, well, the waitress
should've taken it back.

126
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,649
Then, I got a call this morning. I was
chosen to go on the space shuttle.

127
00:06:29,853 --> 00:06:32,717
- We're going to Mars.
- Have a good time.

128
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,484
I'm out.

129
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:51,931
What?

130
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:55,108
Yeah, I'm out.
I'm out of the contest.

131
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:57,942
- You're out?
- Yeah.

132
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,608
Wow, that was fast.

133
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:03,448
Well, it was that woman
across the street.

134
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,614
You know, you better be careful,
buddy. She'll get you next.

135
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,863
And then there were three.

136
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,333
I don't understand you. I really don't.

137
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:24,033
You have nothing better to do
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

138
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,411
I go out for a quart of milk.

139
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,175
I come home and find
my son treating his body...

140
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:32,751
like it was an amusement park.

141
00:07:34,388 --> 00:07:35,717
Ma...

142
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,519
Don't give me "Ma." It's good
I didn't hit the table.

143
00:07:38,594 --> 00:07:40,662
I could have cracked my head open.

144
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,997
People can hear you.

145
00:07:43,065 --> 00:07:45,030
Too bad you can't do that
for a living.

146
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:51,169
You'd be very successful at it.

147
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:54,174
You could sell out
Madison Square Garden.

148
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:56,574
Thousands of people
could watch you.

149
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:58,680
You could be a big star.

150
00:07:58,748 --> 00:08:01,078
All right. That's enough.

151
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,842
I want you to go see a psychiatrist.

152
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,045
No! I am not going
to see a psychiatrist!

153
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:07,690
- Why not? Why won't you go?
- Because I don't want to.

154
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:11,989
- I want you to go see somebody.
- Well, I am not going.

155
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:14,062
It's a good thing
your father's in Chicago.

156
00:08:14,131 --> 00:08:16,529
Hello, Aunt Estelle.

157
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,929
Look at you.

158
00:08:18,003 --> 00:08:21,504
- How did this happen?
- Is that important, really?

159
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:24,437
What is this, a police investigation?
She's been through enough.

160
00:08:24,509 --> 00:08:26,236
She has to relive the experience?

161
00:08:27,112 --> 00:08:29,646
Hi, Denise. 6:30, time for
your sponge bath.

162
00:08:30,448 --> 00:08:34,212
Is it 6:30 already? I fell asleep.

163
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,355
So, George...

164
00:08:41,861 --> 00:08:43,929
what are you doing now?

165
00:08:43,996 --> 00:08:48,431
I hear you got some kind of
television writing thing.

166
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:49,967
Yeah. Television.

167
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:53,197
Let me help you off with that.
Here, just slip it over your head.

168
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:56,570
Well, it's about time.

169
00:08:56,643 --> 00:09:00,612
We thought you were gonna
wind up on the street.

170
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,175
So...

171
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,551
what is it you're doing, exactly?

172
00:09:12,494 --> 00:09:16,121
George, your cousin Shelly
is talking to you!

173
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:23,797
So when was the last time
you took a class?

174
00:09:23,872 --> 00:09:26,099
- It's been a while.
- Are you psyched?

175
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:28,973
Yeah. I'm really psyched.

176
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:31,136
You're gonna thank me
for getting you in here.

177
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:33,612
- Why is that?
- See the guy with the dark hair...

178
00:09:33,683 --> 00:09:36,013
and the red shorts?

179
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,781
Oh, my God.

180
00:09:38,855 --> 00:09:41,117
John F. Kennedy Jr. is here.

181
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:43,954
- He's gonna be in your class today.
- In my class?

182
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:45,686
John Kennedy's gonna
be in my class?

183
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:48,024
I can get you a spot
right behind him.

184
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:50,667
He has got a great butt.

185
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:55,205
Yeah. Butt, butt.
Great butt. John-John's butt.

186
00:09:59,911 --> 00:10:02,502
- Let's slow it down a little.
- Slow it down?

187
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:04,876
Well, you know.

188
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,849
Yeah. I know.

189
00:10:09,122 --> 00:10:11,281
You're okay with that, right?

190
00:10:11,357 --> 00:10:12,890
Yeah. Yeah. Of course.

191
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,086
You think I care about the sex? What
kind of person do you think I am?

192
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:19,993
That doesn't mean anything to me.
I don't care about that.

193
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:21,794
I'll see you Saturday night, then?

194
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,903
Sure. Saturday night.

195
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:27,165
- All right, then. Good night.
- Good night.

196
00:10:27,608 --> 00:10:28,936
Not just a good night.

197
00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:31,373
A great night.

198
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:02,141
Good morning.

199
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,238
Yeah, good morning.

200
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:07,747
Nothing like some good,
solid sack-time.

201
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:09,408
She's not there.

202
00:11:09,486 --> 00:11:11,144
She's doing her wash.

203
00:11:11,721 --> 00:11:14,051
So did you make it
through the night?

204
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:17,054
Yes, I'm proud to say I did.

205
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,693
So you're still master
of your domain.

206
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,059
Yes. Yes, I am.

207
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:24,428
Master of my domain.

208
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:26,569
But I will tell you this:

209
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:28,466
I am going over to her apartment...

210
00:11:28,539 --> 00:11:30,971
and I'm telling her to put
those shades down.

211
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:32,610
Wait. What did you just say?

212
00:11:32,678 --> 00:11:34,803
I can't take it anymore.

213
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,709
She's driving me crazy.
I can't sleep.

214
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:39,110
I can't leave the house.
I'm climbing walls.

215
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,149
I'm dating a virgin,
I'm in this contest.

216
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,413
Something's gotta give.

217
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:48,992
Do you hear what you're saying?
Can you hear it?

218
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:51,323
This is a beautiful woman
walking around naked...

219
00:11:51,397 --> 00:11:53,089
and you wanna tell her to stop?

220
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:55,826
That's the dumbest thing
I ever heard!

221
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:57,833
It's incomprehensible...
I won't let you.

222
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,599
- I'm doing it. Get out of my way.
- No, no. You can't.

223
00:12:00,674 --> 00:12:03,709
This is something that comes about
once in a lifetime.

224
00:12:03,777 --> 00:12:06,141
When we were boys looking through
our windows...

225
00:12:06,213 --> 00:12:09,441
we'd think, "Why can't a woman
out there take her clothes off?"

226
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:12,484
Now that wish has come true,
and you wanna throw it away?

227
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,552
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not gonna let you do it.

228
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:17,658
- Kramer, get out of my way.
- Don't do it.

229
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:21,489
For my sake. God knows,
I don't ask you for much.

230
00:12:21,563 --> 00:12:26,066
Please, Jerry. I'm begging you.
Please! Come on! Please!

231
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,273
- All right, all right.
- Yes!

232
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:35,303
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

233
00:12:36,812 --> 00:12:38,402
She's not there.

234
00:12:38,481 --> 00:12:40,914
Oh, I can wait.

235
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:47,182
The nurse was giving her
a sponge bath?

236
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,224
Every night at 6:30.

237
00:12:50,294 --> 00:12:52,157
The nurse was gorgeous.

238
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,628
Then I got a look at the patient.

239
00:12:54,766 --> 00:12:56,094
I was going nuts.

240
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:59,693
I guess you'll be going back
to that hospital.

241
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,772
Well, my mother, Jerry.

242
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,873
But are you still
master of your domain?

243
00:13:06,844 --> 00:13:09,812
I am king of the county.

244
00:13:09,882 --> 00:13:12,075
- You?
- Lord of the manor.

245
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:18,886
John F. Kennedy Jr.

246
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:21,820
What?

247
00:13:21,894 --> 00:13:24,361
He was in my aerobics class.

248
00:13:24,431 --> 00:13:26,499
Really? Did you talk to him?

249
00:13:26,566 --> 00:13:31,330
No, you don't understand.
He was working out in front of me.

250
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:34,098
After the class was over,
I timed my walk to the door...

251
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:36,402
so we'd get there
at the exact same moment.

252
00:13:36,477 --> 00:13:39,876
And he says to me,
"Quite a workout."

253
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:42,015
"Quite a workout"?

254
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:45,050
- What did you say?
- I said, "Yeah."

255
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,148
Good one.

256
00:13:47,254 --> 00:13:50,119
Listen, listen. Then I showered,
and I dressed...

257
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:52,226
and I saw him again
on the way out.

258
00:13:52,294 --> 00:13:56,194
So we're walking and talking,
and he asked me my name...

259
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:59,492
and I think I said Elaine,
but I mean, who the hell knows?

260
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:02,660
So then he says to me:

261
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:07,139
"Do you wanna split
a cab uptown?"

262
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:10,602
And I said, "Sure," even though
I was going downtown.

263
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,150
So we get in the cab, and I mean,
I have no idea where I'm going, right?

264
00:14:16,219 --> 00:14:19,653
But this is John F. Kennedy Jr.
We're talking about.

265
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:21,415
So he says, "Where do you live?"

266
00:14:21,492 --> 00:14:23,992
I was close to your block,
so I said your building.

267
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:25,651
He dropped me off in front...

268
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:30,129
and then I had to take a cab all
the way back downtown to my house.

269
00:14:30,567 --> 00:14:31,896
Oh, God.

270
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,004
The question is...

271
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,734
are you still master
of your domain?

272
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,203
I'm queen of the castle.

273
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,114
You're back.

274
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,916
Of course I'm back.

275
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,649
Why wouldn't I be back?

276
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,920
My mother is in the hospital.
I'm gonna pay her a visit.

277
00:14:56,996 --> 00:14:59,429
I know, but two days in a row?

278
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,157
You didn't have to do this.

279
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:05,293
You're my mother.
What wouldn't I do for you?

280
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:06,700
You know what you could do?

281
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,205
I haven't eaten lunch or dinner.

282
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,640
I can't eat this hospital food.

283
00:15:11,712 --> 00:15:15,305
Maybe you could run down to the deli
and get me a sandwich.

284
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:17,750
You got it, Ma.

285
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:19,648
A little later.

286
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:25,420
Could you go now, Georgie?
I'm very hungry. I'm weak.

287
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:27,357
Wait a while. What's the difference?

288
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,862
I don't understand why
you can't do this for me!

289
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:34,025
I just got here, Ma. I'd like to spend
a little time with you.

290
00:15:34,103 --> 00:15:36,296
But if you wait, they won't
let you back in!

291
00:15:36,371 --> 00:15:38,496
Visiting hours are almost over!

292
00:15:38,574 --> 00:15:42,338
Ten minutes. Here.
Have some Tic Tacs.

293
00:15:43,947 --> 00:15:46,413
Get the hell out of here.

294
00:15:46,483 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm sorry you came.

295
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,543
6:30. Time for your bath.

296
00:15:56,527 --> 00:16:00,825
George. I'm hungry.

297
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:04,333
Hang on, Ma. Hang on.

298
00:16:10,642 --> 00:16:13,210
- Hi.
- Hi.

299
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:14,902
Did you get your hair done today?

300
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:19,415
No, I just fixed it a little bit.

301
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:21,575
You-know-who isn't here.

302
00:16:21,653 --> 00:16:23,915
He was in the early class today,
but I think...

303
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,581
you made quite an impression
on him yesterday.

304
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:29,250
What? What? Who? Me?

305
00:16:29,328 --> 00:16:31,328
- What impression?
- Let me put this back.

306
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:34,295
No, no, now! Tell me now!
What did he say?

307
00:16:34,367 --> 00:16:36,367
- He asked about you.
- He asked about me?

308
00:16:36,436 --> 00:16:38,902
John Kennedy asked about me?
What did he say?

309
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:40,630
He wanted to know your situation.

310
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:43,173
- What? I have a situation?
- I said you were single.

311
00:16:43,243 --> 00:16:46,506
- That was good. That was very good.
- He said you were just his type.

312
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,981
Okay. You're trying to hurt me?
You're trying to injure me?

313
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,111
He told me to tell you he'll be in your
neighborhood tomorrow around 9:00.

314
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:58,953
He'll stop in front of your building if
you wanna come down and say hello.

315
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,861
All right, Ma.
I'll talk to you later.

316
00:17:05,935 --> 00:17:10,768
Nothing. I'm watching
Tiny Toons here on Nickelodeon.

317
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,376
I like kids' shows. They have a very
innocent, wholesome quality.

318
00:17:14,443 --> 00:17:17,034
Okay. All right, talk to you later. Bye.

319
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:21,146
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
That's very, very good.

320
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:23,343
It's hot in there, so just walk around.

321
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,354
Yeah. Don't be ashamed.
Don't be ashamed. That's good.

322
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:29,492
Yes, yes, yes.

323
00:17:34,398 --> 00:17:36,796
The woman across the block
Has nothing on

324
00:17:36,868 --> 00:17:38,526
Nothing on, nothing on

325
00:17:38,603 --> 00:17:41,831
The woman across the block
Has nothing on, nothing on

326
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:43,166
All through the day

327
00:17:59,591 --> 00:18:03,753
All you got is instant coffee?
Why don't you get some real coffee?

328
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,923
I don't keep real coffee here.
I get my coffee on the outside.

329
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:10,532
Yeah!

330
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:13,137
- It's Elaine.
- Come on up!

331
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,141
- Where did you get those socks?
- I don't know.

332
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:18,868
- I think those are my socks.
- How are these your socks?

333
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:20,843
I don't know, but those are my socks.

334
00:18:20,915 --> 00:18:24,542
I had a blue-striped pair just like that,
and now I don't have them anymore.

335
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:28,416
Yeah, you fell asleep on the sofa,
and I took them off your stinking feet!

336
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:30,524
They looked so good,
I had to have them!

337
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,024
- Well, they're my socks!
- They're my socks!

338
00:18:34,462 --> 00:18:36,689
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy.
- What are we doing here?

339
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:39,561
- This is ridiculous.
- You believe this? We're fighting.

340
00:18:39,634 --> 00:18:41,965
I haven't been myself.
I've snapped at everybody.

341
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,038
I'm yelling at strangers
on the street.

342
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:50,238
Hello.

343
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,148
You caved?

344
00:18:58,221 --> 00:19:00,619
- It's over?
- You're out?

345
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:05,091
Oh, my God. The queen is dead.

346
00:19:05,829 --> 00:19:09,559
I figured you'd cruise,
at least through the spring.

347
00:19:10,435 --> 00:19:12,503
- What happened?
- It was...

348
00:19:13,137 --> 00:19:14,465
John-John.

349
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,608
- John-John.
- John-John.

350
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:20,471
But you made it through
the day before.

351
00:19:20,545 --> 00:19:25,674
But he told Joyce that he wants to
meet me outside here at 9:00 tonight.

352
00:19:25,751 --> 00:19:28,445
- Why outside here?
- Because he thinks I live here.

353
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,646
Remember the cab? He dropped me off
out front. He's picking me up.

354
00:19:32,124 --> 00:19:34,317
All right, Costanza...

355
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:35,721
it's you and me.

356
00:19:35,828 --> 00:19:39,524
And then, there were two.

357
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,624
Elaine Benes...

358
00:19:42,702 --> 00:19:45,498
Kennedy Jr.

359
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:55,614
Let's go in the bedroom.

360
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:57,842
- Really?
- Yes.

361
00:19:57,918 --> 00:19:59,918
- You sure?
- Yes.

362
00:19:59,987 --> 00:20:03,022
- You really want to?
- I do. I'm ready.

363
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:04,585
Okay.

364
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,852
I know how difficult this
must have been for you.

365
00:20:08,497 --> 00:20:10,792
You don't know the half of it.

366
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:15,100
- What do you mean?
- It's kind of silly, but...

367
00:20:21,077 --> 00:20:23,338
Contest? A contest?

368
00:20:23,413 --> 00:20:25,538
This is what you do
with your friends?

369
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:28,741
It was just a bet. It actually started
with George and his mother.

370
00:20:28,818 --> 00:20:31,182
I don't wanna hear another word!

371
00:20:31,254 --> 00:20:34,347
To think how close I came to you
being the one!

372
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:37,050
I must have been out of my mind.

373
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:52,504
Marla.

374
00:20:52,577 --> 00:20:54,668
Hi. I'm glad I ran into you.

375
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:58,179
I don't wanna have anything to do
with you or your perverted friends.

376
00:20:59,517 --> 00:21:03,952
Get away from me.
You're horrible, horrible. All of you.

377
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:08,927
- What happened?
- I told her about the contest.

378
00:21:09,995 --> 00:21:12,086
Boy. She's a wacko.

379
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:14,699
- Hey, what happened?
- What?

380
00:21:14,768 --> 00:21:16,733
- You were meeting Kennedy.
- He didn't show.

381
00:21:16,803 --> 00:21:18,165
Yeah, he did.

382
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:20,397
What? He's out there?

383
00:21:20,474 --> 00:21:23,042
- Oh, my God. I gotta go.
- No, no, he just left.

384
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,574
- What?
- He was talking to Marla.

385
00:21:26,646 --> 00:21:28,008
Marla?

386
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:31,174
She was, like, crying.
He was consoling her.

387
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:34,219
She got into his car,
and they just drove away.

388
00:21:35,456 --> 00:21:39,492
- He left with Marla, the virgin?
- Yeah.

389
00:21:39,861 --> 00:21:42,430
- They drove away?
- Yeah, drove away.

390
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:48,264
- You know, I said hello to him. He's...
- Oh, my God in heaven.

391
00:21:50,506 --> 00:21:52,699
Is that..?

392
00:21:52,774 --> 00:21:54,774
Kramer?

393
00:21:59,749 --> 00:22:02,044
He's waving.

394
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:22,998
Oh, John...

395
00:22:23,073 --> 00:22:25,904
that was wonderful.

396
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,056
Men wanna see women naked.

397
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,987
Whatever it is you won't show us...

398
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,491
that's what we're obsessed
with seeing.

399
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:46,063
If women always wore hats in public,
all the time...

400
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:48,200
you'd see men buying
Playhead magazine...

401
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,699
you know, Skulls of the Big 10.

402
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,066
This would be what we're
interested in.

403
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,504
What about cultures, like in
National Geographic...

404
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:57,734
where everybody is naked?

405
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:01,347
What are men in these cultures trying
to look at when the women walk by?

406
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:03,312
How could you have a strip
club there?

407
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:07,352
Woman takes off the necklace and
the nose ring, that's it, show's over.

408
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:11,948
The men are going, "Boy, did you see
that little indentation in her lip?

409
00:23:12,026 --> 00:23:14,287
I told you, man, this place is hot!"

409
