1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:05,020
I find it fascinating, when you go
in the stationery store...

2
00:00:05,045 --> 00:00:08,399
that they're manufacturing
millions of pens constantly.

3
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:12,171
We're all buying them. I must have
bought 6000 Bics in my life.

4
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:15,440
I've used up maybe two of them.
Where's the rest of them?

5
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:17,584
Move a refrigerator,
there's a couple there.

6
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:22,051
But that doesn't account for it.
Where are all the pens?

7
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:24,487
That's why it's embarrassing
if you don't have one.

8
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,889
"You got a pen? Can I borrow a pen?"
We always have to whisper...

9
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:31,429
because it's so humiliating.
"l don't have a pen."

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,756
"They're making millions
of them every week."

11
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,232
"l know. Where are they?"

12
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,644
May I help you?

13
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:48,407
Yeah, hi.
I'm looking for a Rolamech 1000.

14
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:53,918
- It's a mechanical pencil.
- Oh, I know the Rolamech 1000.

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,958
No, I'm sure you do.

16
00:00:58,025 --> 00:01:00,116
They're pretty expensive.

17
00:01:00,194 --> 00:01:02,285
Well, it's for my boss.

18
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:03,953
What do you do?

19
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,097
Whatever.

20
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,259
Well, we don't have any
in stock right now...

21
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,904
but I would be happy
to order it for you.

22
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,006
Just give me your phone number...

23
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,972
and when it comes in,
I'll give you a call.

24
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,805
Your name is...?

25
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:20,446
Elaine.

26
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,514
Elaine.

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:28,651
- And your last name?
- It's just Elaine. Like Cher.

28
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:33,318
And your number?

29
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:38,522
It's KL5-2390.

30
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,959
Okay. Thanks a lot.

31
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:44,332
- You'll be hearing from me.
- Okay. So long.

32
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:47,804
- Why did you give him my number?
- Don't worry about it.

33
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,971
I think he got ideas.

34
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:53,307
I wonder if any woman
ever said that about Einstein.

35
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,141
Just call me when
the pencil comes in.

36
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:57,750
Why does Mr. Pitt prefer
a pencil to a pen anyway?

37
00:01:58,485 --> 00:01:59,847
Hey, look who's here.

38
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,011
Hey.

39
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,316
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi, Julie.

40
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,754
Elaine, Julie.

41
00:02:06,827 --> 00:02:09,259
- Hi.
- Oh, hi. Elaine's my middle name.

42
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,694
Mine's Ike.

43
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:14,395
Hey, wanna get some lunch?

44
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,832
Just had a big bowl of Kix.

45
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,496
Oh, well, that's very mature.

46
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,538
- What about you?
- Oh, please come, Elaine.

47
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,768
No. Maybe you could
bring me back something.

48
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:27,539
- Sure, all right. What do you want?
- I don't know.

49
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,615
- A big salad.
- What big salad?

50
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:32,251
- I'm going to the coffee shop.
- They have big salads.

51
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,182
I've never seen a big salad.

52
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,617
They have big salads.

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,691
Is that what I ask for,
the big salad?

54
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,756
- It's okay. Just forget it.
- No, hey, I'll get it.

55
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:44,864
What's in the big salad?

56
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:49,298
Big lettuce, big carrots.
Tomatoes like volleyballs.

57
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,969
So you gonna be upstairs?
See you in a little while.

58
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,697
- Okay.
- Okay.

59
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,208
Maybe I should just get married.

60
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,404
Dating really is getting
embarrassing, isn't it?

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,313
I know. Whenever I'm on a date,
I always feel like people can tell.

62
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:06,817
People on dates shouldn't be
allowed out in public.

63
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,046
It's embarrassing for them.

64
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,850
It's painful for us to watch.

65
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,822
I'm going out with someone later,
I'm not even taking her out.

66
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:17,054
- Good for you.
- I don't need people staring at us.

67
00:03:17,131 --> 00:03:19,165
You're telling me.

68
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,131
What was that?

69
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,837
Gendason. What a jerk.

70
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:32,137
I'm never playing golf
with him again.

71
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,304
- Who? Gendason?
- Steve Gendason.

72
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,074
Why does that name
sound so familiar?

73
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,017
- He used to be a baseball player.
- How'd you end up playing golf with him?

74
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:43,053
I met him on the course
a couple years ago.

75
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,522
Yeah. Played with him a lot.
But today was it.

76
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:49,594
We're on the 15th hole.

77
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,958
He's beating me by a couple
of strokes.

78
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:54,623
Then he's about to hit
his second shot...

79
00:03:54,702 --> 00:04:00,263
when he picks up the ball
and cleans it.

80
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:04,103
- So what?
- Sorry.

81
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,107
The rules clearly state you cannot
clean the ball unless it's on the green.

82
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,013
- The rules are clear about that.
- Certainly are.

83
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:15,121
- So I penalized him a stroke.
- So, what happened?

84
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,223
He lost it!

85
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,214
We almost came to blows.

86
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,520
We're face to face,
like a manager and an umpire.

87
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,186
We're like,
"Hey, what are you talking about?!

88
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:29,427
- Think I'm gonna put up with that?!"
- All right. All right! You're in my face.

89
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,295
I don't see what the big deal is.

90
00:04:31,372 --> 00:04:36,967
Hey, a rule is a rule. And let's face it,
without rules, there's chaos.

91
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:42,611
I like Anna Quindlen's column.
And Safire.

92
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:44,375
Don't you like Safire?

93
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,485
Safire.

94
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,644
Although at times
he can be rather pedantic.

95
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:51,154
He can be pedantic.
He can be pedantic.

96
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:54,152
And Bob Herbert's great.

97
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:55,727
He worked for the <i>Daily News</i>.

98
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:58,922
Yes. Yes.
You know what's interesting?

99
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,466
The quarterback
for the Atlanta Falcons...

100
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:06,333
is Bobby Hebert, no R...

101
00:05:06,407 --> 00:05:07,872
which I find fascinating.

102
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:10,199
You know, it's Herbert...

103
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:13,073
H-E-R-B-E-R-T...

104
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:17,616
Hebert, H-E-B-E-R-T.

105
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:22,348
Hebert. It's a fun name to pronounce.
Try and say it. Hebert.

106
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:25,381
Go ahead, take a shot. Hebert.
All right.

107
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,493
- Thanks. I got it.
- No. I'd like to pay.

108
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,561
Now, Julie, Julie, don't insult me.

109
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,221
What difference does it make
who pays? It's meaningless.

110
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,368
- Okay, thanks, George.
- Here's your big salad to go.

111
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,333
Oh, thank you.

112
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,539
Hello.

113
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:44,370
No, she's not here.

114
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:47,705
Okay, fine. Whatever.

115
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:49,644
Yes, I'll tell her.

116
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,511
Okay, goodbye.

117
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:56,588
Stationery-store guy called
to say he ordered your pencil.

118
00:05:57,624 --> 00:06:00,215
I told you. He has ideas.

119
00:06:00,294 --> 00:06:02,089
He doesn't even care
if a man answers.

120
00:06:02,162 --> 00:06:04,253
Or you.

121
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,066
- Hey.
- Hey.

122
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:08,599
Hey.

123
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,327
- Sorry we're late.
- It's no problem.

124
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:12,995
- Here's your big salad.
- Thank you, Julie.

125
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,731
You're very welcome.

126
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:18,071
So I guess I better get going.

127
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,577
Meeting Mother at the Guggenheim.
You don't wanna go?

128
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,739
No, you Guggenheim.
I'm not much of a Guggenheimer.

129
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,748
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah. You go.

130
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:28,979
- Okay, I'll see you later. Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

131
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:37,060
Did you see
what just happened here?

132
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:39,891
Well, that all depends.

133
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,667
Did you happen to notice that Julie
handed the big salad to Elaine?

134
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:47,233
- Yeah, so?
- Well, she didn't buy the big salad.

135
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,069
I bought the big salad.

136
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:52,035
- Is that a fact?
- Yes, it is.

137
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,010
She just took credit for my salad.

138
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:56,649
- That's not right.
- No, it isn't.

139
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:58,478
- I'm the one who bought it.
- You did.

140
00:06:58,552 --> 00:07:00,711
- She should've said something.
- She could have.

141
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,582
- Oh, I know.
- Imagine...

142
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:06,556
her taking credit
for your big salad.

143
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:11,229
You buy a big salad for somebody,
it would be nice if they knew it.

144
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:13,366
Obviously.

145
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:15,362
- Turn on the TV.
- What?

146
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,560
Put it on. Put it on!

147
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:21,470
<i>Neither the district attorney's office
nor the police department...</i>

148
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,633
<i>have answered
any questions as yet.</i>

149
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,744
<i>To repeat,
in case you're just joining us...</i>

150
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,847
<i>former baseball star
Steve Gendason has been taken...</i>

151
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,007
<i>to police headquarters
for questioning...</i>

152
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:34,745
<i>in the murder of Bobby Pinkus,
the owner of Royal Dry Cleaners...</i>

153
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:38,254
<i>at 2759 Amsterdam Avenue.</i>

154
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,949
<i>According to Pinkus' wife...</i>

155
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:43,028
<i>Gendason had been involved
in a dispute with the cleaner...</i>

156
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:46,597
<i>over a stain on a pair
of gray Sansabelt slacks.</i>

157
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:50,194
<i>We also have a report that
earlier in the day...</i>

158
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,736
<i>a groundskeeper at
Van Cortlandt golf course...</i>

159
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:57,843
<i>reportedly saw an irate Gendason
leaving the clubhouse in a huff.</i>

160
00:07:57,911 --> 00:08:00,707
<i>Whether there is a possible
connection between the two...</i>

161
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,611
<i>is something we'll just have
to wait and find out.</i>

162
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:07,652
- Jerry.
- Well, it had nothing to do with you.

163
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,289
Yeah, but maybe he was so mad
from the penalty stroke...

164
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,049
that he murdered the dry cleaner.

165
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,893
Generally speaking,
you don't need any extra incentive...

166
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,967
to murder a dry cleaner.
I wouldn't worry about it.

167
00:08:25,072 --> 00:08:29,074
- I like Julie. She's very personable.
- Yeah, she's lovely.

168
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,801
- That's great, George.
- Yeah.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,074

Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

170
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:44,715
- So did you enjoy your lunch?
- Yeah. The big salad.

171
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:48,224
It was very good.
Actually, it was too big.

172
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:53,230
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

173
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,663
Because, you know,
she handed you the bag.

174
00:08:57,971 --> 00:08:59,561
I could have handed you the bag.

175
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,937
But she happened to picked it up
at the restaurant, even though....

176
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,010
Even though what?

177
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,974
It's just....

178
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,639
You thanked her, even though....

179
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:13,815
What's the difference?

180
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,251
What? What are you
trying to say, George?

181
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:20,883
It's just that I was the one
that actually paid for the big salad.

182
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:24,622
She just happened to hand it to you.
But it's no big deal.

183
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,959
You want the money
for the big salad, George?

184
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,999
- No, no.
- Then what is your problem?

185
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,160
There is no problem.

186
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,408
Just a small miscommunication
whereby you thanked her...

187
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,805
instead of the person
actually responsible...

188
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,776
for the purchasing
of the big salad.

189
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,515
Kramer played golf with him,
and Kramer thinks a penalty stroke...

190
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,052
may have driven him to it.

191
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,324
Well, they haven't even
arrested him yet.

192
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,722
Come on. Let's go out.

193
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:57,090
No, I don't think so.

194
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,988
Why not?

195
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:01,657
We don't need a bunch of people
staring at us.

196
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,198
- Who's staring?
- Oh, they're staring.

197
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,396
They know we're on a date.
They're making fun.

198
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:08,302
Come on. It's embarrassing.

199
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,137
Hello?

200
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:15,140
No, she's not here.

201
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,306
Yes, I will tell her.

202
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:22,118
No, I don't know what time
she might be coming back.

203
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,881
Look, I gotta go.

204
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:26,458
Bye.

205
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:29,288
That's.... It's a long story.

206
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,698
Hello, Newman.

207
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,368
Hello, Jerry.
I was wondering if you knew...

208
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,595
- where Kramer was.
- No, I don't. Why?

209
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:41,673
You know, Gendason.
This is something, isn't it?

210
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,536
- I suppose.
- What did Kramer say?

211
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:47,305
- I don't know. Nothing.
- Come on, Jerry.

212
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:50,244
You know something.
Tell me! Tell me!

213
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,815
Oh, Chunkys.

214
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,385
Margaret?

215
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:04,729
- Hello.
- You two know each other?

216
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:07,056
You might say that.

217
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,199
We used to go out.

218
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:16,298
Well, toodle-loo.

219
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:19,343
Nice seeing you again, Margaret.
Bye, Jerry.

220
00:11:19,412 --> 00:11:21,412
Have fun.

221
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:32,650
You went out with Newman?

222
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,791
- Just a few times.
- Why?

223
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:42,598
- I liked him.
- You liked Newman?

224
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,899
Look, I'm a little uncomfortable
talking about this, okay?

225
00:11:45,972 --> 00:11:50,509
No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious.
Why did you stop seeing him?

226
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,975
He ended it.

227
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,179
He ended it?

228
00:11:57,818 --> 00:12:00,113
Yes. Yes.

229
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,450
It was a couple of years ago.
Why, does it matter?

230
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,592
No. No, of course not.

231
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,528
Jerry, they found a tee.

232
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:16,096
- What tee?
- A golf tee in the dry cleaner.

233
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:25,476
Newman.
She went out with Newman.

234
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:28,272
- It must be a mistake.
- No. It isn't.

235
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,440
And the most distressing part
is not that she went out with him...

236
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:33,984
but that he stopped seeing her.

237
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,687
Do you understand? He, Newman...

238
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:40,382
Newman stopped seeing her.

239
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,152
Newman never stops
seeing anybody.

240
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,957
Newman will see
whoever is willing to see him.

241
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:48,532
So the question, then, is not
so much why did she see him...

242
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:51,763
as disturbing as that is...

243
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:56,136
but why did he, Newman,
stop seeing her?

244
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,176
Perhaps there's more to Newman
than meets the eye.

245
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,948
No. There's less.

246
00:13:06,386 --> 00:13:09,216
- It's possible.
- No, it isn't.

247
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,323
I've looked into his eyes.

248
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,482
He's pure evil.

249
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:17,555
Maybe he's an enigma.
A mystery wrapped in a riddle.

250
00:13:17,631 --> 00:13:20,029
Yeah. He's a mystery
wrapped in a Twinkie.

251
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,132
- Can I get you some more coffee?
- No, but thank you.

252
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:27,330
By the way, your stationery-store guy
called. He's got your pencil.

253
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:30,300
You are kidding me.

254
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:34,208
No. He left the store early, made a
special trip to the distributor and got it.

255
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:36,679
I bought one yesterday
on 14th Street.

256
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,341
What did you do that for?
He already ordered it.

257
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,647
- I wanted to please Mr. Pitt.
- You better go down and tell this guy.

258
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:45,950
- He's very excited.
- Oh, boy.

259
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,750
- Oh, hi, Julie.
- Hi.

260
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,758
- Hi, Julie.
- How are you, Elaine?

261
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,194
- I'm meeting George here.
- Well, then I better get going.

262
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:55,391
Otherwise George will make me
buy him lunch...

263
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,093
to make up for that big salad
he bought me yesterday.

264
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:00,870
How do you know that?

265
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,773
- Who is it?
- It's Jerry.

266
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,380
It's kind of a bad time.
Could you come back later?

267
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,039
Come on, Newman, open the door!

268
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,524
Hello, Jerry.

269
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,320
What a rare treat. What brings you
down to the east wing?

270
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:26,624
Okay, pudgy, let's stop playing games.
What happened with Margaret?

271
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,291
Don't get excited.
Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?

272
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:34,236
No, we can't. My skin is crawling
just being inside your little rat's nest.

273
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,500
- Now, what happened?
- You wanna know what happened?

274
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:40,908
I'll tell you what happened.

275
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,345
She wasn't my type.

276
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:46,617
- Not your type?
- Not really.

277
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:50,813
- Well, how come?
- She just didn't do it for me.

278
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:55,427
- What is wrong with her?
- Well, if you're happy with her...

279
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,688
that's all that matters.

280
00:14:58,798 --> 00:15:01,992
- You don't think she's attractive?
- No.

281
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,895
I need a really pretty face.

282
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,097
But, hey, that's me.

283
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,205
Okay, Newman. Thanks a lot.

284
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,538
- Care for some lemonade?
- No, thank you.

285
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:16,614
Drop by anytime, Jerry.

286
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:23,183
Jerry. All right, now, listen to this.

287
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,223
"lf a player cleans his ball
during play of a hole...

288
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:31,989
except on the putting green,
he shall incur a penalty of one stroke."

289
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,156
- That's the rule.
- It's just a friendly game.

290
00:15:34,234 --> 00:15:38,270
- Why are you always such a stickler?
- That's the way I was raised.

291
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:41,703
When I was growing up,
I had to be in bed every night by 9:00.

292
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:46,278
And if I wasn't.... Well, I don't have
to tell you what happened.

293
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:50,142
What are you so worried
about this for?

294
00:15:50,216 --> 00:15:52,546
You know he talked about Pinkus
on the course?

295
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,947
- He did?
- Oh, yeah.

296
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,351
He said he brought his pants to
Pinkus', and they came back stained...

297
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:59,890
with some kind
of dry-cleaning fluid.

298
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,186
And Pinkus denied responsibility.

299
00:16:02,262 --> 00:16:04,125
You see?
He was very upset at Pinkus.

300
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,162
So it had nothing to do with you.

301
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,731
Yeah, but maybe I pushed him
over the edge.

302
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:12,099
- No, I don't think so.
- Poor Pinkus.

303
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,898
Poor little Pinkus.

304
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,904
Hey, let me ask you a question.

305
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,672
You met Margaret.
You think Margaret's good-looking?

306
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,050
She's a natural beauty.
No makeup? I like that.

307
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,914
Yeah. And the curls?
You like the curls?

308
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,648
- Oh, I love curls.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

309
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,553
- I'll see you later.
- Where you going?

310
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:35,785
- Gendason's.
- You're going to see Gendason?

311
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,089
It's weighing on my conscience.

312
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:44,867
I think I could have played with dolls
if there were dolls in the house.

313
00:16:45,205 --> 00:16:46,897
It seems like fun to me.

314
00:16:46,973 --> 00:16:51,601
It doesn't seem like a gender thing.
I think I would like to play with dolls.

315
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,708
What's so terrible?

316
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:56,874
So, George, I was talking
to Elaine before...

317
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,915
We're just friends.

318
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:03,582
Yes, well, anyway, she said something
that was kind of intriguing.

319
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,053
Share.

320
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:08,786
Well, when I came over to the table,
she mentioned something...

321
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,523
about how she'd better hurry up and
leave or you'd make her buy lunch...

322
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,792
to make up for the one
you bought yesterday.

323
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:18,535
I'm not following.

324
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:23,335
Well, my question is, how could Elaine
be under the impression...

325
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:25,636
that you bought the big salad...

326
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,837
when I was the one
that handed it to her?

327
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:31,408
Well, she probably just assumed.

328
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,315
Did she?

329
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:38,884
Wait a second.

330
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,758
Are you suggesting that I went
out of my way to tell Elaine...

331
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,991
that even though you handed her
the big salad, that it came from me?

332
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,158
That's what I'm suggesting.

333
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,904
Well, it was a big salad.

334
00:17:54,774 --> 00:17:57,866
And what I would like to know
is how does a person...

335
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,842
who has virtually nothing
to do with the big salad...

336
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,244
claim responsibility
for that salad...

337
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:07,614
and accept a thank-you
under false pretenses?

338
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:13,115
George, all I did was
hand someone a bag.

339
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,598
It's just that my boss
is very demanding...

340
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,827
and he needed the pencil
right away.

341
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,665
Well, why did you tell me
to order it if you knew...

342
00:18:26,739 --> 00:18:29,307
you were going to get one
someplace else?

343
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:32,035
No, I didn't know. I'm sorry.

344
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,543
I went all the way down
to the warehouse.

345
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,944
It took me three hours.

346
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,346
I had a big fight with the foreman.

347
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,177
Really? A fight with the foreman?

348
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:48,487
- Yes.
- Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.

349
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:50,151
Yeah?

350
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:54,166
Well, then how about
going out with me?

351
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,696
Okay.

352
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:04,704
I mean, they found a tee.
And he played golf that day.

353
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:07,437
Nobody walks into a dry cleaners'
with a tee.

354
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,610
The circumstantial evidence
is overwhelming.

355
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:14,276
You had how many dates with him?
Three?

356
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,346
Around three. I don't know.

357
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,286
And...?

358
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:23,952
I told you, he stopped calling me.

359
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,963
I moved on. I'm not hung up on him.

360
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:34,262
- What are you looking at?
- What? I'm not looking. Nothing.

361
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:36,436
Why are you looking at my face?

362
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,369
Where am I gonna look?

363
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,447
Kiss me.

364
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:53,286
I can't.

365
00:19:58,665 --> 00:20:00,357
Newman.

366
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:05,462
Newman ruined it.
All I could think of...

367
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:10,405
when I was looking at her face was,
"Newman found this unacceptable."

368
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,075
I'm going out
with the stationery-store guy.

369
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,510
You're going out
with the stationery-store guy?

370
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,813
I felt so guilty about the pencil
I couldn't say no.

371
00:20:25,158 --> 00:20:27,226
Well, well, well.

372
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:31,363
I'm not treating you
to lunch anymore!

373
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:36,464
You had to tell Julie that I made
a special point of telling you...

374
00:20:36,536 --> 00:20:39,161
that I bought you
the big salad, didn't you?

375
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,610
You know, if it was a regular salad,
I wouldn't have said anything.

376
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:48,372
But you had to have the big salad!

377
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,881
Hello?

378
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,521
What?

379
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,122
You're kidding.

380
00:20:58,191 --> 00:20:59,918
I'm turning it on.

381
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,822
Oh, my God, get out of here.

382
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:06,297
Hey, listen to this. They issued
a warrant for Gendason's arrest.

383
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:10,232
He escaped, and the police spotted
him on the New Jersey Turnpike.

384
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:14,430
<i>As you can see,
he's in a white Ford Bronco.</i>

385
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,041
<i>The police have cleared
the highway traffic in front...</i>

386
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,905
<i>but they are keeping
their distance.</i>

387
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:21,410
<i>They don't want this situation
to escalate.</i>

388
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:25,813
<i>And we have gotten an identification
on the driver of the vehicle.</i>

389
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,714
His name is Kramer...

390
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:31,414
and he's reportedly one
of Gendason's golfing buddies.

391
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,390
<i>911, what are you reporting?</i>

392
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:38,189
Yeah, this is Kramer.
I got Gendason in the car.

393
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:40,025
Now, he wants to see his fish.

394
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,930
I'm taking him to see his fish,
so tell the police to back off.

395
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,230
<i>Okay, sir. And what's your name?</i>

396
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,806
My name is Kramer.
You know who I am, damn it!

397
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:54,104
- I told you not to take the turnpike.
- I thought we would blend in.

398
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,407
If you took the Palisades,
this wouldn't happen.

399
00:21:56,482 --> 00:22:00,245
- Then we would've had bridge traffic.
- Just drive.

400
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:11,729
To me, murder doesn't even really
seem like that great of a revenge.

401
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:16,426
Wouldn't years of subtle psychological
mind games be a lot more satisfying?

402
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:19,833
Constantly calling them and hanging
up when they pick up the phone.

403
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:23,373
Sending pizzas and taxis
to their house all night long.

404
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:27,138
After a while they go, "l wish this guy
would kill me. I can't take it anymore!"

405
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,976
How come when the police
catch some really bad criminal...

406
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,881
they put him in the handcuffs,
hit him with the baton...

407
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:38,490
put the chokehold on him, but then
they don't want him to hurt his head...

408
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,024
when they're putting him
in the patrol car.

409
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:45,687
"Watch your head. Don't hit that
metal edge there. That really hurts."
