1
00:00:00,809 --> 00:00:03,261
Whenever you ask for the doggy bag
in a restaurant...

2
00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:05,944
there's a sense of
failure there, isn't there?

3
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:09,881
People always whisper it
to the waiter, "Excuse me...

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:13,816
I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to give me the doggy bag.

5
00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:15,889
I couldn't make it."

6
00:00:16,258 --> 00:00:18,792
It is embarrassing because
a doggy bag means either...

7
00:00:18,861 --> 00:00:21,429
you were at a restaurant
when you're not hungry...

8
00:00:21,497 --> 00:00:26,500
or you've chosen the stupidest
way to get dog food that there is.

9
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:29,035
How about the doggy bag
on a date?

10
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:30,728
That's a good move for a guy, huh?

11
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:34,273
Let me tell you, if you're a guy and you
ask for the doggy bag on a date...

12
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:37,708
you might as well have them
just wrap up your genitals too.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,872
You're not gonna be needing
those for a while either.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

15
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:55,057
- Is that bothering you?
- No. Not at all.

16
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:57,962
It's the BMW.

17
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:00,158
Oh, could you please hurry?

18
00:01:00,903 --> 00:01:02,630
"Please hurry."

19
00:01:02,705 --> 00:01:05,000
Look at you.
Look what you've become.

20
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:07,836
What? What have I become?
I haven't become anything.

21
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:09,705
Oh, Carl can't wait a few...

22
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,369
more minutes?
- I don't want to keep him waiting.

23
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,745
- He'll like you more.
- That's impossible.

24
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,552
Stan, why do you have to
pick your teeth at the table?

25
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,417
- Leave me alone.
- It's disgusting.

26
00:01:21,523 --> 00:01:24,751
Yeah, I'm gonna get married
real soon.

27
00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:27,862
- So where am I dropping you?
- His place.

28
00:01:28,364 --> 00:01:30,591
Guy's got quite a racket.
I take you to dinner...

29
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:32,290
then drop you at his apartment.

30
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,028
And he gets the rest of my chicken.

31
00:01:36,272 --> 00:01:38,203
So is tonight the night?

32
00:01:38,274 --> 00:01:39,739
You never know.

33
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,967
Baby doll.

34
00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:45,476
Thank you, brother.

35
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:03,522
What, do you smell something?

36
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,600
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?

37
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,169
- Of course I smell something.
- What is it?

38
00:02:10,572 --> 00:02:12,640
I think its BO.

39
00:02:14,143 --> 00:02:15,608
What?

40
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,843
It's BO.
The valet must've had BO.

41
00:02:20,449 --> 00:02:23,518
It can't be. Nobody has BO like this.

42
00:02:23,585 --> 00:02:27,018
Jerry, its BO.

43
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:29,282
But the whole car smells.

44
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,018
- So?
- So when somebody has BO...

45
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:34,526
the O usually stays with the B.

46
00:02:34,596 --> 00:02:36,630
Once the B leaves,
the O goes with it.

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,440
Oh, my God.

48
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:53,839
- I can't believe you ski.
- I'm a great skier.

49
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,313
Yeah, what else?

50
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:58,453
Let's see. I ski, I fish...

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,281
I pillage, I plunder.

52
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:04,791
- You pillage and plunder?
- When I travel.

53
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,293
See, finally, finally I get
to meet a man...

54
00:03:08,364 --> 00:03:12,195
who pillages and plunders.
I'm so lucky.

55
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:27,147
- It should only take a second.
- Yeah, I'm gonna poke around.

56
00:03:33,622 --> 00:03:35,952
Hey, what do you know?
Look at that.

57
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:38,524
A lesbian sighting.

58
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,252
My lucky day.

59
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:43,762
They're so fascinating. Why is that?

60
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:46,025
Because they don't want us.

61
00:03:46,635 --> 00:03:48,703
You gotta respect that.

62
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:50,930
Oh, my God.

63
00:03:51,006 --> 00:03:54,234
It's Susan! But what do I do?

64
00:03:54,543 --> 00:03:56,338
George?

65
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,307
- Susan. Hi.
- Hi.

66
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:02,641
Oh, boy.

67
00:04:03,185 --> 00:04:04,684
What are you doing here?

68
00:04:04,753 --> 00:04:07,048
- Renting a video.
- Right.

69
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:08,484
What do you got there?

70
00:04:08,557 --> 00:04:11,285
Oh, some... some stupid movie.

71
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,792
This is Mona.

72
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,087
Hi.

73
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:20,030
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Yes. Well...

74
00:04:20,102 --> 00:04:22,932
Well, I'll let you two catch up.

75
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:29,207
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yes.

76
00:04:29,278 --> 00:04:31,539
I just haven't seen you
in a long time.

77
00:04:31,613 --> 00:04:34,580
And you didn't expect me to be
holding hands with a woman.

78
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,575
Oh, please. Me?

79
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,983
Come on, that's great.

80
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,589
Are you kidding?
I think that's fantastic.

81
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:44,749
I've always encouraged
experimentation.

82
00:04:44,827 --> 00:04:48,954
I'm the first guy in the pool.
Who do you think you're talking to?

83
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,827
- I know who I'm talking to.
- Of course you do.

84
00:04:52,601 --> 00:04:56,899
It's just, you know,
I never knew that...

85
00:04:56,972 --> 00:04:59,267
- I like women?
- There you go.

86
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,672
So how long has this
been going on?

87
00:05:04,646 --> 00:05:06,475
Since you and I broke up.

88
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:13,781
So after me, you...

89
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:15,583
went that way?

90
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,355
Yeah.

91
00:05:18,427 --> 00:05:21,860
I think that's fantastic. Good for you.

92
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,328
Nice. That's very nice.

93
00:05:29,738 --> 00:05:31,601
- So, what do you got there?
- I don't...

94
00:05:32,574 --> 00:05:35,802
- Rochelle, Rochelle.
- Yeah.

95
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:39,778
It's a foreign movie.
A film is what it is, actually.

96
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:42,416
- A lot of nudity in that, huh?
- No, no, just a tiny bit.

97
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:44,074
It's not even frontal nudity.

98
00:05:44,152 --> 00:05:46,982
It's "sidal" nudity.

99
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:48,981
Next.

100
00:05:49,191 --> 00:05:50,883
- That's me.
- Good seeing you, George.

101
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,526
Yes, good to see you too.

102
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:54,286
And good luck with...

103
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:56,454
With the whole thing there.

104
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:00,232
What are you returning?

105
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:03,832
Rochelle, Rochelle.

106
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,133
Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle.
A young girl's strange...

107
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:08,833
erotic journey from Milan to Minsk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

108
00:06:09,044 --> 00:06:11,772
That'll be $3.49.

109
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:13,642
Three forty-nine? It says $1.49.

110
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,545
You didn't rewind it. There's
a $2 charge for not rewinding.

111
00:06:16,618 --> 00:06:18,481
But there's no signs here.

112
00:06:18,554 --> 00:06:21,521
- This is an outrage.
- Don't give him any money for that.

113
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,591
It'll cost you less to keep it
another day, rewind it...

114
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,423
and bring it back tomorrow.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

115
00:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,531
I'm not giving you the satisfaction.

116
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,429
I'm gonna watch it again.

117
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:35,464
How could that hurt?

118
00:06:37,072 --> 00:06:40,335
So this morning I go down
to the garage to check the car out.

119
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:43,478
I figure by this time,
the odor molecules have had...

120
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:46,739
at least 12 hours to "de-smellify."
- Right.

121
00:06:46,815 --> 00:06:49,145
I open the car door...

122
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:51,808
like a punch in the face...

123
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,844
the stench hits me.

124
00:06:53,922 --> 00:06:57,219
It's almost as if it had gained strength
throughout the night.

125
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:00,555
You know, I can think of at least
six known offensive odors...

126
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,755
that I would rather smell
than what's living in your car.

127
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:06,025
- What about skunk?
- I don't mind skunk.

128
00:07:06,101 --> 00:07:08,795
- Horse manure?
- I love horse manure.

129
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,033
I've never seen anything like this
in my life.

130
00:07:13,108 --> 00:07:14,800
In fact, I went to the car wash...

131
00:07:14,876 --> 00:07:18,639
they want $250 to detail it
and get the smell out.

132
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,872
I'm not paying for that.
That's not my responsibility.

133
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,917
I'm driving to that restaurant,
and demand they pay for it.

134
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,816
Absolutely.

135
00:07:27,623 --> 00:07:30,556
Listen, let me ask you something.

136
00:07:30,726 --> 00:07:34,990
When you're with a guy and he
tells you he has to get up early...

137
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:37,927
what does that mean?
- It means he's lying.

138
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,133
- Why, is that what he told you?
- Yeah. Last night.

139
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:48,276
Oh, come on. Men have to
get up early sometime.

140
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:50,502
No. Never.

141
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:54,638
Jerry, I'm sure I've seen men on
the street early in the morning.

142
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:57,011
Well, sometimes we do
have to get up early...

143
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,176
but a man will always
trade sleep for sex.

144
00:07:59,254 --> 00:08:02,255
Is it possible I'm not as attractive
as I think I am?

145
00:08:03,592 --> 00:08:05,159
Anything's possible.

146
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:10,364
Yeah.

147
00:08:10,966 --> 00:08:13,899
- What's the matter with you?
- Steinbrenner!

148
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:15,969
- He's ruining my life.
- Oh, yes.

149
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:18,834
- Steinbrenner.
- I can't take another season with him.

150
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:21,100
He just traded away
their best prospects...

151
00:08:21,176 --> 00:08:24,768
just like he did with Buhner,
McGee, Drabeck, McGriff.

152
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:26,470
I know the list.

153
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,283
What's that smell?

154
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:31,146
What..? What smell?

155
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:35,616
You stink.

156
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:39,950
- What do you mean, I stink?
- You stink.

157
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:42,460
- Why don't you take a shower.
- I showered.

158
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:44,463
Oh, wait a second.

159
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,295
Since I showered, I've been in the car.

160
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:50,097
- So?
- Don't you see what's happening?

161
00:08:50,172 --> 00:08:52,900
It's attached itself to me. It's alive.

162
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:56,601
If it's attached itself to you...

163
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,573
Oh, my God.

164
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:02,843
That's why Carl said he had to
get up early, because I stink.

165
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:05,847
Jerry, he thinks I have BO. Me.

166
00:09:06,988 --> 00:09:08,817
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

167
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,958
- It's George.
- I'm coming right down.

168
00:09:11,026 --> 00:09:12,957
- All right, what happened?
- What happened?

169
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:15,358
My car stinks is what happened.

170
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:18,863
And it's destroying the lives
of everyone in its path.

171
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,496
- This is BO?
- Yes.

172
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:27,665
- This is unbelievable BO.
- I know.

173
00:09:27,743 --> 00:09:30,641
At the car wash, the guy told me
in 38 years in the business...

174
00:09:30,712 --> 00:09:33,440
he's never smelled anything like it.

175
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:36,584
So let me ask you, do you think
I could've done this?

176
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:38,878
No, no. It's the valet guy.

177
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,114
No, no. I mean, driven Susan
to lesbianism.

178
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,383
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.

179
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,153
What if her experience with me
drove her to it.

180
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,524
Suicide, maybe. Not lesbianism.

181
00:09:49,598 --> 00:09:51,461
The woman she was
"lesbianing" with...

182
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:54,534
Susan told me she's never
been with a guy.

183
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:59,633
Oh, this isn't even BO.
This is beyond BO. It's BBO.

184
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:02,606
There should be a BO squad
that patrols the city...

185
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:06,110
to sniff them out, strip them down
and wash them with a soapy brush.

186
00:10:06,181 --> 00:10:11,685
The funny thing is, somehow
I find her more appealing now.

187
00:10:11,787 --> 00:10:14,355
Like, if I knew she was
a lesbian when we went out...

188
00:10:14,422 --> 00:10:16,820
I never would've
broken up with her.

189
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:18,482
Let me see if I understand this.

190
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:22,291
On second thought...

191
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,300
Oh, my God, there he is.
That's the guy.

192
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,903
No, thank you. Go back.

193
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:31,368
No, go back.

194
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:33,336
No, back, back.

195
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:36,477
Go back. I got it. I'll park it.

196
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:39,409
I'll park it. Go back. You go back.

197
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,641
Sorry. Thank you. Thank you, no.

198
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:45,911
What do you mean "stunk up"?

199
00:10:45,987 --> 00:10:47,714
I mean the car stinks.

200
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,151
George, does the car stink?

201
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:50,814
- Stinks.
- Stinks.

202
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:53,256
Well, perhaps you're the one
who has the odor.

203
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:55,453
I've never smelled in my life, buddy.

204
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:58,758
- Really? Well, I can smell you now.
- That's from the car.

205
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:01,767
Maybe you stunk up the car,
rather than the car stinking up you.

206
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,497
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg.

207
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,965
Thank you very much.

208
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:09,940
Well then, go out and smell the car.
See which smells worse.

209
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:12,545
I don't have time to smell cars.

210
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:14,443
Forget about smelling the car.

211
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,607
Smell the valet. Go to the source.

212
00:11:16,685 --> 00:11:19,515
- You gotta smell the car.
- I'm a busy man.

213
00:11:19,588 --> 00:11:21,019
Come on. One whiff.

214
00:11:22,591 --> 00:11:24,386
All right. One whiff.

215
00:11:30,599 --> 00:11:32,963
All right. I give up. I
admit it, it stinks.

216
00:11:33,034 --> 00:11:34,362
Now could you let me out?

217
00:11:34,436 --> 00:11:37,767
- Yeah, you'll pay for the cleaning?
- Yes, $50. I'll give you $50.

218
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,136
- Fifty dollars, that's not gonna cover it.
- Whatever you want.

219
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:44,107
- I'll give you whatever you want!
- I want half, 125.

220
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,476
Yes! Yes, 125 is good.
Now could you please open the door!

221
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:49,810
- All right.
- Let me out of here!

222
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:54,053
- Oh, my God.
- What?

223
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,316
The video. Someone stole
the video right out of the car.

224
00:11:57,392 --> 00:12:00,518
- Someone stole Rochelle, Rochelle?
- Well, you left the window open.

225
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,026
We had to air out the car.

226
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,961
- You should pay for it.
- I'm not paying for that.

227
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:07,124
They already got my $7.

228
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:11,102
Erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.

229
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:19,443
- The valet had such bad BO?
- Oh, man, just rampant, mutant BO.

230
00:12:19,514 --> 00:12:23,846
The O went from the valet's B
to the car to me.

231
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,422
It clings to everything.
Jerry thinks it's an entity.

232
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:33,693
But I showered,
and I shampooed. So...

233
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:36,729
- That's a relief.
- Yeah.

234
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:41,196
- What?
- It's still there.

235
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,929
No, no, it can't be.
I shampooed. I rinsed.

236
00:12:44,005 --> 00:12:46,096
- I repeated.
- It's still there. I smelled it.

237
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:48,208
I don't smell anything.
Take another smell.

238
00:12:48,276 --> 00:12:49,638
- No. No.
- No, here, just...

239
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:51,438
Please!

240
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,312
Which movie was that again?

241
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:56,006
Rochelle, Rochelle.

242
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:57,708
George.

243
00:12:57,786 --> 00:12:59,319
Hey. Thanks for meeting me here.

244
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:03,082
- Yeah, I don't have much time.
- Yeah, listen, I gotta ask you...

245
00:13:03,258 --> 00:13:05,485
I was a little concerned that...

246
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,960
perhaps I was responsible
in some way for your...

247
00:13:10,365 --> 00:13:12,626
metamorphosis.

248
00:13:14,469 --> 00:13:16,730
That'll be $98.

249
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,497
What $98?

250
00:13:18,573 --> 00:13:20,072
That's what I said, $98.

251
00:13:20,575 --> 00:13:23,439
How could that piece
of crap cost $98?

252
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,602
- George, I really have...
- Do you believe this?

253
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,975
Ninety-eight dollars!

254
00:13:30,151 --> 00:13:31,479
Do you have any cash?

255
00:13:31,553 --> 00:13:33,518
I guess.

256
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:36,657
I need, like, 35. Thanks.

257
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,319
So was it me?

258
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:43,430
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Is that what
you wanted to talk to me about?

259
00:13:43,498 --> 00:13:44,963
- Here.
- Oh, thanks.

260
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:48,364
- Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
- Yeah, sure.

261
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:51,003
- I gotta go.
- Listen.

262
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,969
Let me ask you something:

263
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:57,242
If you and Mona were ever
to dance...

264
00:13:57,412 --> 00:14:00,310
how do you decide who leads?

265
00:14:00,582 --> 00:14:02,946
I mean, do you take turns?

266
00:14:03,018 --> 00:14:05,951
Do you discuss it beforehand?
How does that work?

267
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:07,716
You're an idiot.

268
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:12,819
Why? That's a legitimate
sociological question.

269
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:14,222
- I'll see you.
- But...

270
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:16,920
Oh, and George, by the way...

271
00:14:16,998 --> 00:14:20,363
you stink. You need a bath.

272
00:14:20,435 --> 00:14:22,662
It's not me! It's the car!

273
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,673
I didn't think I'd come.

274
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,471
I knew you would.

275
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,942
- Oh, Mona.
- Oh, Kramer.

276
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,081
You can give it the executive
treatment. That includes...

277
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:44,953
complete deionization
of the entire vehicle.

278
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:49,324
Where we spray everything
with Ozium-D, let it deionize...

279
00:14:49,397 --> 00:14:52,762
vacuum the spray out
with a deionizing machine.

280
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:54,993
Hit it with high-pressure
compressed air...

281
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,003
and wet-dry vac it to extract
the remaining liquids.

282
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,234
And we top it off with
one of our seven air fresheners.

283
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:06,176
In your case, I would recommend
the jasmine or the potpourri.

284
00:15:07,315 --> 00:15:09,042
Let's do it.

285
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,484
The first thing that we're gonna do...

286
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:16,852
is flush the follicles
with the five essential oils.

287
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:21,019
Then we put you under a vapor
machine, and then a heated cap.

288
00:15:21,096 --> 00:15:23,630
Then we shampoo and shampoo...

289
00:15:23,698 --> 00:15:25,288
and condition and condition.

290
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:28,596
Then we saturate the hair...

291
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:30,294
in diluted vinegar.

292
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:35,238
Two parts vinegar, 10 parts water.
Now, if that doesn't work...

293
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,810
we have one last resort.

294
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,412
Tomato sauce.

295
00:15:41,116 --> 00:15:43,343
Tomato sauce?

296
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,430
Thanks a lot.

297
00:16:11,913 --> 00:16:13,605
Wait a minute.

298
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:15,907
It still smells.

299
00:16:15,984 --> 00:16:18,018
It still smells!

300
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,981
It still smells.

301
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,351
It still smells.

302
00:16:26,427 --> 00:16:30,122
- How could it still smell after all that?
- I don't know.

303
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,358
- What are you gonna do?
- I'll tell you what, I'm selling that car.

304
00:16:33,434 --> 00:16:35,661
- You're selling the car?
- You don't understand...

305
00:16:35,737 --> 00:16:38,305
what I'm up against.
This is a force more powerful...

306
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:40,134
than anything you can imagine.

307
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:43,868
Even Superman would be helpless
against this kind of stench.

308
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:46,812
And I'll take anything I can get for it.

309
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,312
Maybe I'll buy it.

310
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,313
Are you crazy?

311
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:53,420
Don't you understand
what I'm saying to you?

312
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:57,115
This isn't just an odor. You need
a priest to get rid of this thing.

313
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,026
- I still smell.
- You see?

314
00:17:01,095 --> 00:17:05,131
You see what I'm saying to you?
It's a presence. It's the beast.

315
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:08,025
All right, let me smell you.

316
00:17:08,102 --> 00:17:10,033
Kramer. Kramer!

317
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:13,401
- What's that? What's going on?
- Kramer open up, I know you're there!

318
00:17:13,474 --> 00:17:15,201
- Susan.
- Kramer!

319
00:17:15,276 --> 00:17:18,004
- What is going on?
- You know what's going on?

320
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,374
First, he vomits on me.

321
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:23,346
Then he burns down
my father's cabin.

322
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,850
And now he's taken
Mona away from me.

323
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,750
- He stole your girlfriend?
- Yes.

324
00:17:28,823 --> 00:17:31,756
She's in love with him.

325
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:35,260
Amazing.

326
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,921
I drive them to lesbianism,
he brings them back.

327
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,203
Hello.

328
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,777
- She still there?
- No. She left.

329
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:55,712
- What is going on? What did you do?
- I don't know, I didn't do anything.

330
00:17:55,783 --> 00:18:00,217
I was in the video store, and I was
practicing my golf swing, you know.

331
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:02,379
You know, with a broom, and...

332
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:06,584
Yeah. But she saw me take a swing,
and she told me...

333
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:11,425
that the club is going back too fast.
Well, we started talking.

334
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:14,898
She's a golf teacher. So I went
to a lesson, and, you know...

335
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,629
something happened between us.
She's a golf teacher.

336
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:21,741
I've struck gold! I've already taken
six strokes off my game.

337
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:26,445
That's the least of what
you've accomplished.

338
00:18:27,048 --> 00:18:30,015
I'm gonna have dinner with her.
Can I borrow your jacket?

339
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,446
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

340
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,588
Wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer.
Hold on a second, I don't get this.

341
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:39,216
This woman has never been
with a man her entire life.

342
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:41,829
I'm Kramer.

343
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,766
Look, I know what you're
going through.

344
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:51,496
Women. Who knows what they want?

345
00:18:53,041 --> 00:18:55,109
I just don't know what
she sees in Kramer.

346
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:59,645
Listen, you're beautiful. You're
intelligent. You'll meet other girls.

347
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:03,078
- You think so?
- Yes, I know so.

348
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,344
You happen to be
a very eligible lesbian.

349
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,587
- You're very sweet.
- Hey, I know what I'm talking about.

350
00:19:10,658 --> 00:19:13,625
But I gotta be honest with you,
I gotta tell you...

351
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:17,259
ever since I saw you holding hands
with that woman...

352
00:19:17,498 --> 00:19:19,361
I can't get you out of my mind.

353
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,366
- Really?
- Yeah.

354
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:24,096
You're just so hip.

355
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,838
- Oh, my God.
- What?

356
00:19:26,908 --> 00:19:31,172
It's Allison. I dated her right after you.
She was obsessed with me.

357
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,376
George?

358
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:39,613
Allison. Hi.

359
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:42,449
- Oh, my God. How are you?
- Good.

360
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:45,148
You know, you owe me $50.

361
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:47,886
Fifty dollars, right. Right.

362
00:19:47,962 --> 00:19:51,498
I don't have it on me right now.
Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.

363
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,566
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

364
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:58,332
That's a beautiful vest.

365
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:00,237
Thank you.

366
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:09,243
I don't understand it. I was with her
last night at my apartment.

367
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:10,850
It was very romantic.

368
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,681
With that fake wood wallpaper, the
atmosphere is fabulous in there now.

369
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,187
It's like a ski lodge.

370
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,291
- What year did you say this was?
- Ninety.

371
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,792
We're on the couch. I moved to hug
her, next she tells me she's leaving...

372
00:20:21,863 --> 00:20:23,760
she's got to get up early.

373
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:26,593
- That's strange.
- How many miles you got on this?

374
00:20:26,667 --> 00:20:27,995
Twenty-three thousand.

375
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,693
And I was looking good too.

376
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,237
I had a nice new shirt on.
I'm wearing your jacket.

377
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,341
Wait a second. My jacket.

378
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,070
I wore that in the car. The beast.

379
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:42,108
- This wicked funk.
- What?

380
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,617
I can't sell this car.

381
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,948
This thing.

382
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:52,115
It's got to be stopped.

383
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:55,228
- So, what do you want to do?
- Sauce me.

384
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:42,299
Why do we need BO?

385
00:21:42,577 --> 00:21:44,372
What is the function of it?

386
00:21:44,445 --> 00:21:47,673
Everything in nature has a reason,
has a purpose, except BO.

387
00:21:47,748 --> 00:21:50,510
It doesn't make any sense.
Do something good...

388
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:53,813
hard work, exercise,
you smell very bad.

389
00:21:53,888 --> 00:21:57,389
This is the way the human being
is designed. You move, you stink.

390
00:21:58,793 --> 00:22:00,986
Why can't our bodies help us?

391
00:22:01,062 --> 00:22:05,292
Why can't sweat smell good?
It'd be a different world, wouldn't it?

392
00:22:05,566 --> 00:22:08,499
Instead of putting your laundry
in the hamper, put it in a vase.

393
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:12,161
Go down to the drug store, pick up
some odorant and perspirant.

394
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,571
Probably have a dirty sock hanging
from the rearview mirror of your car.

395
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:18,109
Then on a special night,
maybe a little underwear...

396
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,974
coming out of your breast pocket.

397
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,638
Just to show her that she's important.

397
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:29,407
