1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:05,028
The life expectancy now is 72,
I think, for men.

2
00:00:05,029 --> 00:00:07,494
Seventy-five or six
or something for women.

3
00:00:07,564 --> 00:00:10,189
It's amazing to think that
a couple thousand years ago...

4
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:12,197
life expectancy was 30.

5
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:16,497
Which, in our terms, would mean you
get your driver's license around 5...

6
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:19,697
you'd marry at 9, divorced at 15.

7
00:00:19,774 --> 00:00:22,774
In your late teens,
you move down to Florida.

8
00:00:22,843 --> 00:00:26,105
I guess that's how spring break
got started. I don't know.

9
00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:28,440
And eventually people
say things about you, like:

10
00:00:28,515 --> 00:00:31,208
"Well, it's amazing, he's 28,
but he's still very alert.

11
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:34,749
His mind is so sharp, you would think
you're talking to a 2-year-old."

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,119
What's the point?

13
00:00:43,425 --> 00:00:49,394
When I like them, they don't like me.
When they like me, I don't like them.

14
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,060
Why can't I act with ones I like
the way I do with ones I don't?

15
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:57,726
Well, you've only got another 50 years
or so to go and it'll all be over.

16
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:03,670
Maybe I need someone
who doesn't speak English.

17
00:01:03,908 --> 00:01:06,067
Yeah, how about a mute?

18
00:01:07,111 --> 00:01:09,075
A mute would be good.

19
00:01:09,679 --> 00:01:11,746
Where you gonna meet a mute?

20
00:01:11,813 --> 00:01:15,144
This is what my life has come to:
Trying to meet a mute.

21
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,845
I don't know, Jerry,
Something's missing.

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,716
There's a void, Jerry.
There's a void.

23
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:25,755
A deep, yawning chasm.

24
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:29,220
Well, there's gotta be more to life
than this.

25
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,828
What gives you pleasure?

26
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:33,860
Listening to you.

27
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:36,556
I listen to this for 15 minutes,
I'm on top of the world.

28
00:01:36,633 --> 00:01:39,098
Your misery is my pleasure.

29
00:01:39,402 --> 00:01:41,526
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, how you doing?

30
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:45,537
Good. Okay. Well, it's all set.
I start tomorrow.

31
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:48,266
- Start what?
- I signed up to do volunteer work...

32
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:50,534
- with senior citizens.
- Really?

33
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,406
Yeah. God. I can't tell you how I feel.

34
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,275
I mean, I feel so good.
I really feel good.

35
00:01:57,349 --> 00:02:00,246
The strange thing is, I mean,
I haven't even met the woman yet.

36
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:02,942
- Volunteer work?
- What are you gonna do down there?

37
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,713
They say all it is is you go
over to their apartment and...

38
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:08,686
you take them out for a walk
and you get a cup of coffee...

39
00:02:08,757 --> 00:02:11,087
and it's supposed
to make them feel good.

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,454
That's what I do with him.

41
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:17,426
Wait. When did you get this idea?

42
00:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,360
Last time I had lunch with you here.

43
00:02:19,433 --> 00:02:22,524
You were going on and on and on
about how you wanna...

44
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,896
meet somebody
who didn't speak English.

45
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,567
What, do you break it in with her
then you try it out on me?

46
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:33,573
- And anybody could do this?
- Yeah.

47
00:02:33,643 --> 00:02:35,301
Really?

48
00:02:35,378 --> 00:02:37,411
Helping people.

49
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,810
Of course.

50
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,470
Of course.

51
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:43,913
It makes perfect sense.

52
00:02:43,985 --> 00:02:46,348
How could I not be doing this?

53
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,818
- I am gonna help somebody, damn it.
- What about you?

54
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:51,250
No, it's not for me.

55
00:02:51,323 --> 00:02:53,721
Jerry, if anybody should
be doing this, it's you.

56
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:56,724
What kind of a person are you?

57
00:02:56,961 --> 00:02:59,051
I think I'm pretty much like you.

58
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,720
Only successful.

59
00:03:07,669 --> 00:03:09,930
This is a wonderful thing.
They're so grateful...

60
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,571
to have someone to talk to.

61
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:14,037
And I can tell you
that everyone who participates...

62
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:16,175
finds the experience
extremely rewarding.

63
00:03:16,242 --> 00:03:18,105
Well, I feel better already.

64
00:03:18,177 --> 00:03:20,574
I mean, I'm feeling like
a good person.

65
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:23,040
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:23,448 --> 00:03:25,310
Thank you.

67
00:03:25,816 --> 00:03:27,781
Hey, hey, what's your guy's
name again?

68
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:30,010
Fields. Sidney Fields.

69
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:33,484
Eighty-seven years old.
Eighty-seven.

70
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:38,421
- How about your guy?
- Ben Cantwell, 85.

71
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:40,254
You think we'll make it to that age?

72
00:03:40,328 --> 00:03:42,088
We? No.

73
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,460
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,131
So, what's up, diggety-dog?

75
00:03:52,203 --> 00:03:55,396
George and I just signed up with
the senior citizens volunteer agency.

76
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:56,869
Same thing Elaine's doing.

77
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,438
Oh, that's too bad.

78
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:00,866
Don't say I didn't try to warn you.

79
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:05,001
- What are you talking about?
- Oh, Jerry, I'm surprised at you.

80
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,044
- What?
- It's a con.

81
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:11,343
These agencies are usually a front
for some money-laundering scheme.

82
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,917
Or they're bunco artists.

83
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:16,782
Bilking people out of their life savings.
Oh, yeah.

84
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:20,857
- Where do you get this?
- The alternative media, Jerry.

85
00:04:20,925 --> 00:04:23,118
That's where you hear the truth.

86
00:04:23,194 --> 00:04:25,659
Kramer? Kramer?

87
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:30,231
Kramer! Where are you? Kramer!

88
00:04:30,299 --> 00:04:32,958
Come on, I'm in here. Come on.

89
00:04:33,702 --> 00:04:35,030
- There you are.
- Yeah.

90
00:04:35,103 --> 00:04:37,796
Hello, Newman.

91
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:42,570
Jerry. George. So did you ask him
about the records?

92
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:44,004
- Well...
- What records?

93
00:04:44,077 --> 00:04:49,545
Newman and I are going partners,
selling used records.

94
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:58,114
You know Ron's Records
down on Bleecker?

95
00:04:58,187 --> 00:04:59,845
They pay big cash for used records.

96
00:04:59,922 --> 00:05:01,956
So we thought if you had any
of those big...

97
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:04,887
old-fashioned useless records
just lying around, you know...

98
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:06,753
We'd take them off your hands. Free.

99
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,896
Let me ask you something.
What do you do for a living, Newman?

100
00:05:09,963 --> 00:05:12,622
I'm a United States postal worker.

101
00:05:13,632 --> 00:05:15,722
Aren't those the guys
that always go crazy...

102
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,095
and come back with a gun
and shoot everybody?

103
00:05:18,703 --> 00:05:20,997
Sometimes.

104
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,070
- Why is that?
- Because the mail never stops.

105
00:05:26,142 --> 00:05:28,368
It just keeps coming and coming
and coming.

106
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:30,010
Never a letup. It's relentless.

107
00:05:30,078 --> 00:05:32,975
Every day it piles up more and more
and you gotta get it out...

108
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:34,637
but more keeps coming in!

109
00:05:34,715 --> 00:05:37,942
Then the bar code reader breaks,
and it's Publishers Clearing House day!

110
00:05:38,017 --> 00:05:39,744
All right, all right, all right.

111
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,443
Just take the records.
They're in the bedroom. Take them.

112
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:45,180
- Take anything you want.
- Yeah, yeah.

113
00:05:49,459 --> 00:05:51,493
I'll give you 5 bucks.

114
00:05:51,995 --> 00:05:53,494
- Five bucks?
- Five bucks?

115
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:57,564
- Do you know what those are worth?
- Yeah, I do. Five dollars.

116
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,859
Those records are worth more
than 5 dollars.

117
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:01,968
- He's gypping us.
- You're gypping us.

118
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:05,366
Well, what do you got? You know,
you got Don Ho Live In Honolulu.

119
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,598
You got Jerry Vale
Sings Italian Love Songs.

120
00:06:08,674 --> 00:06:10,968
And you got Sergio Mendes.
Now, come on!

121
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,474
Wait, wait, wait. Sergio Mendes
has a cult following.

122
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:15,111
Why, they follow him like a cult.

123
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:17,247
Can't walk down the street
in South America.

124
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:21,349
Look, that's his problem, all right?
Now, you don't like it? Too bad.

125
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,882
- I don't like it.
- I don't like it.

126
00:06:23,952 --> 00:06:25,679
Then get out of my store, all right?

127
00:06:25,754 --> 00:06:28,913
You bring me something decent,
I'll give you some money.

128
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,285
- All right, we'll be back, Jack.
- All right.

129
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:33,323
- Come on.
- We'll be back...

130
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:34,755
Jack.

131
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,298
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

132
00:06:44,369 --> 00:06:47,995
- Agency?
- Yeah. Is this Sid Fields' residence?

133
00:06:48,071 --> 00:06:51,571
- Sid Fields?
- What the hell is it?

134
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:53,174
- Mr. Fields?
- What?

135
00:06:53,242 --> 00:06:55,707
Hi. I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
The agency sent me.

136
00:06:55,777 --> 00:07:00,210
The agency? What agency?
The CIA?

137
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,006
- No, no, the senior...
- Who let you in here?

138
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:05,343
- The woman.
- Oh, her.

139
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:10,715
She steals from me. Steals my money.
She says she doesn't speak English.

140
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:13,448
My ass, she doesn't speak English.

141
00:07:13,524 --> 00:07:17,320
Plays that freaking voodoo music.

142
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:20,428
Tries to hypnotize me.

143
00:07:20,496 --> 00:07:22,860
She thinks she's gonna turn me
into a zombie...

144
00:07:22,932 --> 00:07:24,658
and then rob me blind.

145
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:27,467
Well, I wasn't born yesterday.

146
00:07:27,535 --> 00:07:31,627
I might drop dead today, but I
sure as hell wasn't born yesterday.

147
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:33,829
Now, get the hell out of my house.

148
00:07:34,807 --> 00:07:37,466
But, Mr. Fields, I'm here
to spend some time with you.

149
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:39,633
Oh, really?

150
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:43,302
Are you the boyfriend?
I know she's got a boyfriend.

151
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,108
Are you gonna kill me?
I'm an old man, for crying out loud.

152
00:07:47,183 --> 00:07:49,375
You gonna kill an old man,
you coward?

153
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:51,951
No, Mr. Fields. Look. Really. I'm...
Here's my ident...

154
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,179
I can't read that, you fool.

155
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:58,415
- Well, what's all this stuff?
- Trash. Garbage.

156
00:07:59,526 --> 00:08:00,786
You're throwing this out?

157
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:04,953
I believe that's what you do
with garbage, you idiot.

158
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:08,623
Really? You don't want any of this?

159
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,668
Well, if I wanted it, I wouldn't be
throwing it away, would I, Einstein?

160
00:08:14,737 --> 00:08:17,305
I have friends that would really love
to have these.

161
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:21,806
Well, take it. I sure as hell am not
gonna give it to my family.

162
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,877
Well, do you wanna go out and go
for a walk, get a cup of coffee?

163
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:26,171
With you?

164
00:08:26,247 --> 00:08:28,405
I'd rather be dead.

165
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:31,306
Well, maybe I'll get going, then.

166
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:35,210
I just remembered I got
an appointment to get my tonsils out.

167
00:08:35,287 --> 00:08:38,514
Good. Thank God. Good riddance.

168
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:41,483
Oh, listen, before you go...

169
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:44,183
would you mind
changing my diaper?

170
00:08:50,632 --> 00:08:53,495
Oh, I feel great for 85.

171
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:59,127
You know, the average life span
for an American male is, like, 72.

172
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,696
You're really...

173
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:04,535
kind of pushing
the envelope there.

174
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:09,540
I'm not afraid to die,
and I never think about it.

175
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:11,245
You don't?

176
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:13,746
Boy, I think about it a lot.

177
00:09:13,816 --> 00:09:15,382
I think about it at my age.

178
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,417
Imagine how much
I'll be thinking about it at your age.

179
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:21,555
All I'll do is keep thinking about it
till it drives me insane.

180
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:24,189
I'm grateful for
every moment I have.

181
00:09:24,257 --> 00:09:26,291
Grateful?

182
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:30,485
How can you be grateful
when you're so close to the end?

183
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:32,856
When you know that any second:

184
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,958
It could all be over.
I mean, you're not stupid.

185
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,363
You can read the handwriting
on the wall.

186
00:09:38,435 --> 00:09:41,298
It's a matter of simple arithmetic,
for God's sake.

187
00:09:42,171 --> 00:09:44,136
I guess I just don't care.

188
00:09:44,206 --> 00:09:46,569
What are you talking about?

189
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:48,799
How can you sit there
and look me in the eye...

190
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:52,207
and tell me that you're not worried?
Don't you have any sense?

191
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,640
Don't you have a brain?

192
00:09:53,713 --> 00:09:56,077
Are you so completely senile
you don't even know...

193
00:09:56,149 --> 00:09:58,079
what you're talking about
anymore?

194
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,377
Wait a second.
Where are you going?

195
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:03,281
Life's too short to waste on you.

196
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:07,355
- Whoa, whoa, please.
- Get out of my way.

197
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:12,321
But, Mr. Cantwell,
you owe me for the soup.

198
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:27,068
- Mrs. Oliver?
- Yes, my dear?

199
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:36,539
- What's the trouble? Are you all right?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:39,374
Yeah... Yes. Yeah.

201
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:43,309
It's my goiter, isn't it?

202
00:10:44,052 --> 00:10:48,417
Did you say goiter? What goiter?

203
00:10:49,155 --> 00:10:54,123
This football-shaped lump
jutting out the side of my neck.

204
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,864
That goiter.

205
00:11:01,465 --> 00:11:03,590
Hey.

206
00:11:07,703 --> 00:11:10,032
What do you know?

207
00:11:11,239 --> 00:11:13,273
Does it bother you?

208
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,931
Bother me?

209
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,703
Why would a little goiter like that
bother me?

210
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:22,938
No. Not a bit. It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's...

211
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,710
In fact, it's very distinctive.
You know?

212
00:11:26,785 --> 00:11:29,512
I mean, you wanna
know something?

213
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:32,211
I wish I had one.

214
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:35,913
Really.

215
00:11:39,661 --> 00:11:41,352
Come on, Elaine, it's just a goiter.

216
00:11:41,429 --> 00:11:45,396
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
I can't look the woman in the face.

217
00:11:46,199 --> 00:11:50,132
I mean, I keep thinking that goiter's
gonna start talking to me.

218
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:55,464
You'd think that they'd mention that
before they sent you over there.

219
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,735
"Oh, by the way, this woman
almost has a second head."

220
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:04,577
But no, no.
I didn't get any goiter information.

221
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:09,410
They really should mention that in the
breakdown. Height. Weight. Goiter.

222
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:11,312
You know, you try to do some good.

223
00:12:11,385 --> 00:12:14,681
You wanna be a good person,
but this is too much to ask.

224
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:17,516
Well, I'd rather talk to a goiter
with a nice disposition...

225
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,089
than the nut they sent me to.

226
00:12:21,727 --> 00:12:23,555
Georgie, what happened
with your guy?

227
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:26,653
I don't think it's gonna work out.

228
00:12:27,064 --> 00:12:29,394
- What do you mean?
- He fired me.

229
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:32,466
He fired you?

230
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:35,728
How do you get fired
from a volunteer job?

231
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:41,339
I don't know. I was just talking
to the man, and he walked out on me.

232
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:43,772
Well, I don't know about you two,
but I'm quitting.

233
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:45,808
I hate my guy.

234
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:48,537
He's a mean, mean guy.

235
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:51,346
- I wish I could quit.
- So quit.

236
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,676
Yeah, I'm a great quitter.

237
00:12:54,285 --> 00:12:56,376
It's one of the few things I do well.

238
00:12:56,454 --> 00:12:58,987
I come from a long line of quitters.

239
00:12:59,055 --> 00:13:02,214
My father was a quitter.
My grandfather was a quitter.

240
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,882
I was raised to give up.

241
00:13:06,694 --> 00:13:08,284
- Hey.
- Hey.

242
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,520
Well, here's your albums.

243
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:12,460
- What happened?
- Five dollars.

244
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:15,930
- He offered us 5 dollars.
- What kind of stuff you listening to?

245
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:18,125
You embarrassed me at that store.

246
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:20,863
That guy thought we were
a couple of total squares.

247
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:23,063
Oh, yeah,
you and your Sergio Mendes.

248
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,573
Hey, that guy can't even go
to the bathroom in South America.

249
00:13:26,642 --> 00:13:28,266
You should have seen the albums...

250
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:30,878
this old guy I was visiting today
was throwing away.

251
00:13:30,946 --> 00:13:34,413
Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Al Jolson,
Benny Goodman.

252
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:37,676
- Wait, he's throwing them out?
- I asked if my friends could have them.

253
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,443
- He said, "Yeah."
- The coot's sitting...

254
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,382
- on a mountain of gold.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:43,454
You have to get them.
I'm not carrying them.

256
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,056
- But you're gonna come.
- Yeah. I'm going there today.

257
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,249
In fact, you should see
this housekeeper.

258
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:50,087
She's from Senegal.

259
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,990
Wild, wild stuff.

260
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,494
Senegal?

261
00:13:57,066 --> 00:14:00,567
So you don't speak
any English at all?

262
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:04,733
- English? No.
- No.

263
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:06,896
Hey, what are those bums
doing back there?

264
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:09,133
You said they could come
and take the records.

265
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:13,608
It's like watching a couple of hyenas
going through the garbage.

266
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:17,680
- You don't speak any English?
- No English.

267
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,677
I would like to dip my bald head in oil
and rub it all over your body.

268
00:14:27,656 --> 00:14:29,519
You don't understand.

269
00:14:30,025 --> 00:14:31,648
It's a miracle.

270
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:35,784
You don't understand
because you don't speak English.

271
00:14:35,862 --> 00:14:37,896
So I just don't know
if this arrangement...

272
00:14:37,964 --> 00:14:40,930
Hey. Hey. I don't like
what's going on around here.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,295
- I want all of you bums out of here.
- Calm down...

274
00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:45,129
- Don't tell me to calm down.
- Please...

275
00:14:45,203 --> 00:14:47,203
- Get your hands off me.
- Cool it, pops.

276
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:49,601
- Why, you little...
- Wait, wait, Mr. Fields.

277
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:52,868
He's biting me!

278
00:14:54,043 --> 00:14:56,168
My teeth. My teeth!

279
00:14:56,245 --> 00:14:58,141
Where's his teeth?
Where's his teeth?

280
00:14:58,213 --> 00:14:59,746
I saw something fly over here.

281
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,972
Well, turn the light on.

282
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,946
That's the garbage disposal.

283
00:15:07,854 --> 00:15:11,013
My teeth. You idiots.

284
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:13,952
Well, we'll take you to your dentist.
Where's your dentist?

285
00:15:14,025 --> 00:15:15,353
- Downtown.
- All right.

286
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:18,426
George, Kramer, look after Mr. Fields.
I'll go get the cab.

287
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:20,825
Bunch of morons.

288
00:15:25,734 --> 00:15:28,495
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where's the old man?

289
00:15:28,903 --> 00:15:30,867
I thought George
was keeping an eye on him.

290
00:15:30,938 --> 00:15:33,472
- Me? I thought you were.
- Come on, we lost the old man.

291
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,733
Let's go. Get out of the car.
Go. We've gotta find him.

292
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,877
He can't have gotten far.

293
00:15:46,584 --> 00:15:50,449
And we would take
long automobile trips.

294
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,452
- Well, that sounds like a lot of fun.
- Yes, and...

295
00:15:53,522 --> 00:15:56,681
just staring out the window...

296
00:15:56,757 --> 00:16:03,056
you'd see a long view
of rolling pastures and...

297
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:08,530
- Get you going, right there.
And very big Brahman cows and...

298
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,965
- Oh, cows? Oh, that's...
- Yeah, that was when...

299
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:16,162
fascinating.
I began my affair with Mohandas.

300
00:16:18,808 --> 00:16:21,933
- What?
- Mohandas.

301
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,336
Gandhi?

302
00:16:27,414 --> 00:16:29,414
The passion.

303
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:37,012
The forbidden pleasure.

304
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:42,086
You had an affair with Gandhi?

305
00:16:42,927 --> 00:16:47,860
He used to dip his bald head in oil...

306
00:16:48,364 --> 00:16:54,163
and he'd rub it all over my body.

307
00:16:55,003 --> 00:16:57,229
Here. Look.

308
00:16:58,171 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, my God.

309
00:17:01,707 --> 00:17:04,241
The Mahatma?

310
00:17:05,076 --> 00:17:07,235
We're supposed to be looking
for the old man.

311
00:17:07,312 --> 00:17:08,401
Oh, we will. We will.

312
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,038
Twenty bucks.

313
00:17:11,115 --> 00:17:13,409
Twenty bucks?
Are you out of your mind?

314
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:17,814
- Take it or leave it.
- We got Al Jolson here. Al Jolson!

315
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:20,352
Al Jolson. What the hell do I care
about Al Jolson?

316
00:17:20,422 --> 00:17:23,081
I'd just as soon hear
you sing "Mammy."

317
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:26,221
This guy is nothing
but a piece of crap.

318
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:29,920
You are nothing but a piece of crap.

319
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:31,255
What did you call me?

320
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,762
- A piece of crap.
- A piece of crap.

321
00:17:33,832 --> 00:17:38,231
- I find you extremely ugly.
- I find you extremely ugly.

322
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:42,168
- Do you?
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.

323
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:47,400
- You emit a foul and unpleasant odor.
- Oh, is that right?

324
00:17:47,475 --> 00:17:51,238
- I loathe you.
- I loathe you.

325
00:17:51,313 --> 00:17:53,004
That's it. Get out of my store.

326
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,114
- Make us.
- Make us. Make us. Make us.

327
00:17:55,182 --> 00:17:59,012
- I'll make you.
- Wait a minute. Wait! Wait!

328
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:02,552
Do you realize how irresponsible
this is?

329
00:18:02,621 --> 00:18:05,518
Our agency's sole purpose
is to care for senior citizens.

330
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,816
And in one fell swoop
you have single-handedly...

331
00:18:07,892 --> 00:18:09,925
destroyed our reputation.

332
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,551
Yes, but...

333
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:17,397
- Yes?
- It's Tim Fields. Mr. Fields' son.

334
00:18:17,465 --> 00:18:19,692
All right, come on up.

335
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:21,561
Oh, great.

336
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:24,670
I don't know what happened.
We tried to take him to the dentist.

337
00:18:24,738 --> 00:18:26,805
Why were you taking him
to the dentist?

338
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,636
Well, his false teeth got mangled up
in the garbage disposal.

339
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:33,141
What were his teeth doing
in the garbage disposal?

340
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:35,642
- Well, after he bit my friend...
- Bit your friend?

341
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,038
What the hell is going on here?
How do you lose a human being?

342
00:18:41,117 --> 00:18:43,446
- I am sorry.
- And who were these other people?

343
00:18:43,518 --> 00:18:45,313
What were they doing
in the apartment?

344
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:48,785
Well, I brought them up there
to take his records.

345
00:18:48,856 --> 00:18:50,480
Take his records?

346
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,649
Do you realize how valuable
that record collection is?

347
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:55,590
- Hey!
- There you are. Did you find him?

348
00:18:55,662 --> 00:18:56,989
No.

349
00:18:57,062 --> 00:19:00,130
We took the records over to Ron's,
and he tried to screw us...

350
00:19:00,198 --> 00:19:02,289
and then we got in a fight.
- A real melee.

351
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:04,434
Yeah, a real brouhaha.

352
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,328
- Then all the records broke.
- The records? My father's records?

353
00:19:10,406 --> 00:19:13,872
- Did anybody try and call him?
- Yeah, I called, but there's no answer.

354
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:15,304
Well, the line's busy now.

355
00:19:15,377 --> 00:19:18,138
The line's busy. He must be home.

356
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:40,120
We...

357
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:42,559
We couldn't find him.

358
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:48,763
What the hell's the point?

359
00:19:48,835 --> 00:19:50,835
When you like them,
they don't like you...

360
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:53,836
and when they like you,
you don't like them.

361
00:19:54,073 --> 00:19:56,072
Oh, you don't know what you want.

362
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:57,936
You should see a psychiatrist.

363
00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:00,633
I got fixed up last week.

364
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:02,870
I never would get fixed up.

365
00:20:02,946 --> 00:20:05,878
I go to pick her up,
and she opens the door...

366
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:11,314
and she's got this huge goiter
growing out of the side of her neck.

367
00:20:11,386 --> 00:20:14,010
Looked like a football.

368
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:17,614
- What did you do?
- Well, we get to talking...

369
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,452
and as it turns out,
the woman knew Gandhi.

370
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:24,729
We talked for hours.

371
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:27,091
Well, are you gonna see her again?

372
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:29,926
We were getting along real good...

373
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,261
and then she made some tea.

374
00:20:32,335 --> 00:20:35,028
Put some milk in it
without asking me.

375
00:20:35,104 --> 00:20:37,297
Now, that's a turnoff.

376
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:39,701
You don't need that.

377
00:20:39,774 --> 00:20:41,171
The thing about old people...

378
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,206
is everything about them
gets smaller.

379
00:20:43,277 --> 00:20:46,971
You know, their bodies get smaller.
They move into smaller places.

380
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:49,580
They sleep less time,
they eat smaller meals.

381
00:20:49,649 --> 00:20:52,740
Except the car. The older they get,
the bigger their car gets.

382
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:54,613
I've never understood that.

383
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:57,117
Old people have a way
of backing out of the driveway.

384
00:20:57,188 --> 00:20:59,347
Know what I mean?
They don't turn side to side.

385
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:01,990
They just go, "I'm old.
I've been waiting a long time.

386
00:21:02,058 --> 00:21:05,354
I'm backing it out. "You know?
"I'm coming back.

387
00:21:05,427 --> 00:21:08,654
Watch out. I'm coming," you know.
And you've gotta watch out for them.

388
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:11,923
And then once they get out there
they drive so slowly.

389
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:14,157
I would think the less time
you have in life...

390
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:16,302
the faster you would wanna go.

391
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:18,993
I think old people should be allowed
to drive their age.

392
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:21,138
If you're 80, do 80.

393
00:21:21,206 --> 00:21:23,069
If you're 100, go 100.

394
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:27,336
They can't see where they're going
anyway, let them have fun out there.
