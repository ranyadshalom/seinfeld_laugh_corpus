1
00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:06,292
I'm tired of pretending I'm excited
every time it's somebody's birthday.

2
00:00:06,366 --> 00:00:09,196
What is the big deal?
How many times do we have to...

3
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,564
celebrate that someone was born?

4
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:15,367
Every year, over and over.
All you did was not die for 12 months.

5
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:18,271
That's all you've done,
as far as I could tell.

6
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:20,878
I love the astrology things
that tell you the people...

7
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:22,742
that have the same birthday
as you.

8
00:00:22,816 --> 00:00:24,713
It's always an odd group
of people to it.

9
00:00:24,784 --> 00:00:27,682
It's like Ed Asner,
Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,393
I don't wanna live.

11
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:38,121
I don't wanna live!

12
00:00:38,898 --> 00:00:41,023
Because of me?

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,328
You must be joking. Who wouldn't
wanna live because of me?

14
00:00:44,404 --> 00:00:46,836
- I'm nothing.
- No.

15
00:00:46,906 --> 00:00:50,100
- You're something.
- You can do better than me.

16
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:53,336
You could throw a dart out the window
and hit someone better than me.

17
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:54,878
I'm no good.

18
00:00:54,948 --> 00:00:57,278
You're good. You're good.

19
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,974
I'm bad. I'm bad.

20
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,949
You're killing me!

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,918
So what could I do?
I couldn't go through with it.

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:05,648
She threatened to kill herself.

23
00:01:05,892 --> 00:01:07,619
Over you?

24
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,325
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

25
00:01:12,665 --> 00:01:14,562
- Well...
- I'm trying to get in touch...

26
00:01:14,634 --> 00:01:17,100
with Sharon Leonard.
She works for the NYU paper.

27
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,501
This is Jerry Seinfeld. She was
supposed to meet me for an interview.

28
00:01:20,573 --> 00:01:23,164
Oh, what are you gonna get
Jerry for his birthday?

29
00:01:23,243 --> 00:01:25,402
- I got him a great gift.
- Really? What?

30
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:27,443
I got two tickets
to see Guys and Dolls.

31
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:30,207
Oh, that is a good gift.

32
00:01:30,283 --> 00:01:31,714
Maybe he'll take me.

33
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:35,382
No, I'm gonna go with him.

34
00:01:35,455 --> 00:01:36,852
What did you get him?

35
00:01:37,257 --> 00:01:39,154
I got him a two-line phone.

36
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:40,553
Really? That's good.

37
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:42,820
Unbelievable. She's not there.

38
00:01:42,896 --> 00:01:46,193
- What paper does she write for?
- For the NYU school newspaper.

39
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:49,426
She's a grad student in journalism.
Never been to a comedy club.

40
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,263
Never seen me.
Has no idea who I am.

41
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:53,428
Never even seen you?

42
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,267
Gotta kind of envy that.

43
00:01:56,843 --> 00:02:00,106
You know, you've been developing
quite the acid tongue lately.

44
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:02,674
Really?

45
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:06,683
Who do you think is
the most unattractive world leader?

46
00:02:06,886 --> 00:02:08,920
- Living or all-time?
- All-time.

47
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:12,251
If it's all-time, there's no contest.
It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

48
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,250
I don't know. Did you ever
get a good look at De Gaulle?

49
00:02:15,628 --> 00:02:18,561
Lyndon Johnson
was uglier than De Gaulle.

50
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:22,128
I got news for you. Golda Meir
could make them all run up a tree.

51
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:25,902
Golda Meir. Good one, babe.

52
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,932
Hey, come here. Come here.

53
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:33,169
Those two girls behind you,
they're eavesdropping.

54
00:02:34,013 --> 00:02:37,514
- Really?
- You know just because you two...

55
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,275
are homosexuals, so what?

56
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:46,447
I mean, you should come out of
the closet and be openly gay already.

57
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:50,559
So, what do you say?

58
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,730
You know you'll always
be the only man I'll ever love.

59
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:57,560
What's the matter with you?

60
00:02:57,637 --> 00:03:01,138
- Come on. Go along.
- I'm not going along.

61
00:03:01,207 --> 00:03:04,401
I could just see you in Berlin
in 1939 goose-stepping past me.

62
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:07,569
"Come on, Jerry.
Go along. Go along."

63
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:10,372
- You're no fun.
- You know, I hear that all the time.

64
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,780
- Hear what?
- That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

65
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:14,647
Yeah, people ask me that
about you too.

66
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:18,484
Yeah, because I'm single,
I'm thin, and I'm neat.

67
00:03:20,093 --> 00:03:21,854
And you get along well with women.

68
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:24,588
I guess that leaves me in the clear.

69
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,432
Hi, Jerry, it's Sharon Leonard
from the NYU paper.

70
00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:32,127
I'm here at the coffee shop,
and I was a little late.

71
00:03:32,205 --> 00:03:33,772
We must have missed each other.

72
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,703
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Me too.

73
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:39,936
I'll be here for a little while longer,
and I'll try to hook up with you later.

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,074
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday

75
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:50,246
- Hey.
- Hey.

76
00:03:50,323 --> 00:03:54,951
I just thought of a great name for
myself, if I ever become a porno actor.

77
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:59,523
Oh, yeah? What? Buck Naked?

78
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,235
Yeah. How did you know that?

79
00:04:03,736 --> 00:04:06,361
You told me that already.
Like two months ago.

80
00:04:06,806 --> 00:04:08,874
Let me ask you something.

81
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:11,342
What do you think of this shirt?

82
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:14,304
Well...

83
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:17,415
Allison bought it for me.

84
00:04:20,286 --> 00:04:23,116
- How you gonna get out of that one?
- I don't know.

85
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:26,087
I guess I have to wait for her to die.

86
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,123
- Yeah?
- Sharon from NYU.

87
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:32,525
Come on up.

88
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:35,531
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's that reporter from NYU.

89
00:04:35,601 --> 00:04:38,033
She's doing the interview.
I told her to come here...

90
00:04:38,104 --> 00:04:39,569
so we won't miss each other.

91
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:42,367
- Do you want me to stay or..?
- Sure, I don't care.

92
00:04:44,977 --> 00:04:46,339
Hi.

93
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,606
Hi, I'm... I'm Sharon.

94
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:50,681
Hi, I'm Jerry.

95
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,344
- Something the matter?
- No, no. Nothing.

96
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,956
- You look familiar. Have we ever met?
- I'm not sure. Have we?

97
00:04:58,424 --> 00:05:00,219
You look familiar.

98
00:05:00,293 --> 00:05:02,793
Why don't we do this over here?
This is George.

99
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:05,192
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

100
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:08,527
- He'll hang around, if that's okay.
- Sure, I'd like to talk to him too.

101
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:10,862
Oh, really?

102
00:05:11,838 --> 00:05:13,599
- Okay.
- Okay.

103
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,135
There we go.

104
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:20,370
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, I just hate my voice on tape.

105
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,276
It always sounds so high and whiny.

106
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,809
- Well, shall we start?
- Fire away.

107
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:31,082
Okay, let's see. Are you just a
comedian, or do you do anything else?

108
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:34,158
Well, right now George
and I are writing a pilot for NBC.

109
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,954
Oh, so you also work together.

110
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:38,462
Yeah.

111
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,824
Jerry, did you wash this pear?

112
00:05:42,468 --> 00:05:46,527
- Yeah, I washed it.
- It looks like it hasn't been washed.

113
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:49,036
So wash it.

114
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:52,734
You hear the way he talks to me?

115
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,645
You should hear
how my boyfriend talks to me.

116
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,348
What?

117
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:05,683
Hey, let me ask you something.

118
00:06:05,758 --> 00:06:07,325
What do you think of this shirt?

119
00:06:07,727 --> 00:06:09,089
It's nice.

120
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:12,490
Jerry said he didn't like it.

121
00:06:12,565 --> 00:06:14,860
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it was okay.

122
00:06:14,934 --> 00:06:18,265
- Oh, you said you didn't like it.
- Oh, well, so what if I don't like it?

123
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,871
Is that, like, the end
of the world or something?

124
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,837
So how did you two meet?

125
00:06:22,909 --> 00:06:25,102
Oh, actually, we met
in a gym locker room.

126
00:06:25,178 --> 00:06:26,870
Yeah.

127
00:06:26,946 --> 00:06:30,072
Actually, it was in gym class.
I was trying to climb the ropes...

128
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:32,342
and Jerry was spotting me.

129
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:36,612
And I kept slipping
and burning my thighs.

130
00:06:36,789 --> 00:06:39,790
And then finally I slipped,
and I fell on Jerry's head.

131
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,462
We've been close ever since.

132
00:06:44,597 --> 00:06:45,959
Do you guys live together?

133
00:06:46,732 --> 00:06:48,857
- Live together?
- No, I got my own place.

134
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:51,367
Oh, and do your parents know?

135
00:06:52,004 --> 00:06:54,197
- Know what?
- My parents?

136
00:06:54,273 --> 00:06:56,398
They don't know what's going on.

137
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:01,212
You're that girl in the coffee shop
that was eavesdropping on us.

138
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,677
I knew you looked familiar.

139
00:07:02,748 --> 00:07:04,179
Oh, no! No!

140
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:07,646
- I better get going.
- There's been a big misunderstanding.

141
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,653
We did that for your benefit.
We knew you were eavesdropping.

142
00:07:10,723 --> 00:07:13,917
That's why my friend said all that.
It was on purpose. We're not gay.

143
00:07:13,993 --> 00:07:15,924
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

144
00:07:15,995 --> 00:07:18,529
- No, of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.

145
00:07:18,598 --> 00:07:20,689
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have many gay friends.

146
00:07:20,766 --> 00:07:23,198
- My father's gay.
- Look...

147
00:07:23,269 --> 00:07:24,597
I know what I heard.

148
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:27,398
- Heard. It was a joke.
- Look, you wanna have sex right now?

149
00:07:27,473 --> 00:07:30,337
Do you wanna have sex
with me right now? Let's go.

150
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:35,179
Come on! Let's go, baby! Come on!

151
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:40,683
Hey, come on. Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.

152
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,588
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No. No steam.

153
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:47,487
Well, I don't wanna
sit there naked all by myself.

154
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:49,285
The whole thing's your fault.

155
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:52,224
You want me to talk to her?
I'd be perfectly willing to.

156
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:54,262
- I don't think so.
- Because you know me...

157
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:57,527
I walk into a room,
problem solved.

158
00:07:58,704 --> 00:08:00,362
She says she'll think about it.

159
00:08:00,673 --> 00:08:05,233
So what, even if it does come out.
It'll just be in an NYU paper.

160
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:07,439
Why don't you take your jacket off?

161
00:08:07,513 --> 00:08:10,605
- No, I'm okay.
- I'm gonna try her again.

162
00:08:10,683 --> 00:08:12,614
Boy.

163
00:08:12,752 --> 00:08:15,582
Happy birthday. "Faruba!"

164
00:08:15,688 --> 00:08:19,884
- Today's not my birthday.
- Well, I beg to differ.

165
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,452
Well, I think I know
when my birthday is.

166
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:25,153
Yeah, well, you'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

167
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:30,157
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it is my birthday.

168
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:32,830
Would you take the jacket off?

169
00:08:32,905 --> 00:08:35,906
Leave me alone. Get off
my back about the jacket.

170
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:38,168
- Oh, look at this. A phone.
- Yeah.

171
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:40,369
A two-line phone.

172
00:08:41,447 --> 00:08:43,412
That's terrific! Thanks a lot.

173
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,914
Now when someone's
on the phone, I can make a call.

174
00:08:45,985 --> 00:08:48,246
- Yeah.
- Look, Elaine, a two-line phone.

175
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,248
Yeah, I see it.

176
00:08:50,323 --> 00:08:51,913
I'm gonna get one myself.

177
00:08:52,024 --> 00:08:53,591
Where you going?

178
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,750
I gotta go return something.

179
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:59,028
I got a dial tone.

180
00:08:59,098 --> 00:09:01,257
- Okay, this is the maiden call.
- Yeah.

181
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:03,265
Wait, wait. I wanna get the first call.

182
00:09:03,336 --> 00:09:05,404
All right. Go to your house.
I'll call you.

183
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:13,108
- Hello.
- Hello.

184
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:16,009
Hey, it's working. This is great.
Thanks a lot.

185
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:19,015
- Happy birthday, buddy.
- Wait, I got a call on the other line.

186
00:09:19,085 --> 00:09:22,052
- Okay, later.
- All right, I'll talk to you later.

187
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:24,655
- Hello?
- Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU.

188
00:09:24,724 --> 00:09:26,689
- Oh, hi.
- I was just calling to tell you...

189
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,760
I'm not gonna play up that angle
we talked about on the story.

190
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:32,397
Oh, thank you very much.
That's great.

191
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:35,557
Hold on a second.
I got a call on the other line.

192
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,196
- Hello.
- Hey.

193
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:40,270
How you doing? You know I got
that reporter from the newspaper...

194
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:43,135
on the other line.
- So, what did she say?

195
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:45,903
She said she's not gonna play up
that angle in the story.

196
00:09:45,978 --> 00:09:48,638
She thinks we're heterosexual.
I guess we fooled her.

197
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:51,009
All right, I'll get rid of her. Hold on.

198
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,740
Sharon?

199
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:54,879
Hello?

200
00:09:55,354 --> 00:09:57,388
Sharon, are you there?

201
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:01,015
- I'm back.
- You know...

202
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:03,818
I could hear you on the other line.

203
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:13,531
What are you talking about?

204
00:10:13,606 --> 00:10:17,107
I heard what you said:
"Sharon, are you there?"

205
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,836
You heard me talking
on the other line? Are you sure?

206
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:21,343
Yes, I heard you.

207
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,742
Maybe she was disconnected.

208
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:25,941
Maybe she wasn't. Maybe she heard
the whole conversation.

209
00:10:26,018 --> 00:10:30,646
All right. Let me call Kramer, and see
if you can hear anything. Hold on.

210
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:35,251
- Hello.
- There may be...

211
00:10:35,327 --> 00:10:37,019
a problem with the phone.
Hold on.

212
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:38,925
"There may be a problem
with the phone."

213
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:40,690
Oh, no!

214
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,362
Kramer, this phone's
a piece of junk. Goodbye.

215
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:45,902
"This phone's a piece of junk."

216
00:10:45,971 --> 00:10:48,198
Oh, no! She's heard everything!
What will we do?

217
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:51,241
She thinks we're gay. Not that
there's anything wrong with it.

218
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,243
No, no, of course not. People's
personal sexual preferences...

219
00:10:54,313 --> 00:10:56,244
are nobody's business
but their own.

220
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:00,916
- Hi.
- Hi.

221
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,519
Elaine, right? Nice to meet you.

222
00:11:02,588 --> 00:11:05,919
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- Sure. Would you like to take a seat?

223
00:11:05,991 --> 00:11:07,752
- Sure.
- Thank you.

224
00:11:07,827 --> 00:11:10,395
Why don't you take your coat off?

225
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:15,458
So she kept insisting
I take off my coat.

226
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:20,103
I refused, and then she forcibly
tried to get me to remove it.

227
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,467
She didn't take her coat off
in my house, either.

228
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:26,807
You know there are tribes in Indonesia
where if you keep your coat on...

229
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,072
in somebody's house,
the families go to war.

230
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:31,009
Give me a break.

231
00:11:31,116 --> 00:11:33,810
So you don't take your coat off,
and now everyone at NYU...

232
00:11:33,886 --> 00:11:36,955
thinks I'm gay. Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

233
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,817
Not at all.

234
00:11:40,326 --> 00:11:42,621
- Take that coat off.
- I don't want to take it off.

235
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:45,389
Take your coat off, already.

236
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,094
When will we see it?
I'd like to read the article.

237
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,793
They're sending it to me.

238
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,768
All right, well...

239
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,999
- Here you go. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

240
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,704
Two tickets to Guys and Dolls.
I'm gonna go with you.

241
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:07,417
Guys and Dolls?
Isn't that a lavish Broadway musical?

242
00:12:08,354 --> 00:12:12,015
It's Guys and Dolls,
not Guys and Guys.

243
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,392
You're right. Guys and Dolls.
Thanks. Thanks very much.

244
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:18,792
- All right.
- All right, well...

245
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:22,727
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Lainey!

246
00:12:24,937 --> 00:12:28,529
The Collected Works
of Bette Midler.

247
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:35,641
What? I...
I thought you liked Bette Midler.

248
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,475
She's all right.

249
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:40,346
- You said you liked her.
- Well, so what? Maybe I do like her.

250
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:43,113
- So what?
- So nothing.

251
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:48,585
- Well, thanks for the CDs.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

252
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:54,363
Why are those two people
pointing at you over there?

253
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,458
I don't know.

254
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,338
- What've you got there?
- The New York Post.

255
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,739
They've got an article about you.

256
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,179
"Although they maintain
separate residences...

257
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:14,547
the comedian and his longtime
companion seem to be inseparable."

258
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,245
Oh, no, The Associated Press
picked up the NYU story.

259
00:13:17,323 --> 00:13:18,856
That's gonna be in every paper.

260
00:13:18,924 --> 00:13:21,652
I've been outed. I wasn't even in.

261
00:13:23,295 --> 00:13:25,192
Now everyone's gonna
think we're gay.

262
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,026
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

263
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,428
No, not at all.

264
00:13:34,974 --> 00:13:39,135
"Within the confines
of his fastidious bachelor pad...

265
00:13:39,211 --> 00:13:43,441
Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over
the cleanliness of a piece of fruit...

266
00:13:43,515 --> 00:13:47,244
like an old married couple."
I told you that pear was washed.

267
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:54,691
I thought we were friends.

268
00:13:59,398 --> 00:14:01,056
Here we go.

269
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:03,724
I mean, how could you two keep this
a secret from me?

270
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,962
- It's not true.
- Enough lying.

271
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:08,800
The lying is through.

272
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:11,408
Come on, Jerry,
the masquerade is over.

273
00:14:11,477 --> 00:14:14,637
You're thin, late 30s, single.

274
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,605
- So are you.
- Yeah.

275
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:30,655
- Hello.
- George?

276
00:14:31,063 --> 00:14:32,790
Mrs. Seinfeld?

277
00:14:32,865 --> 00:14:35,763
Oh, my God.

278
00:14:36,802 --> 00:14:39,632
Oh, my God. Ma?

279
00:14:39,705 --> 00:14:41,466
- Jerry?
- Ma.

280
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,505
Oh, my God!

281
00:14:43,642 --> 00:14:45,972
My mother!

282
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:50,013
- Jerry.
- Ma, it's not true.

283
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:52,717
It was those culottes
you made him wear when he was 5.

284
00:14:52,785 --> 00:14:55,046
They weren't culottes.
They were shorts.

285
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,587
They were culottes! You bought
them in the girls' department.

286
00:14:58,657 --> 00:15:02,523
By mistake.
By mistake, Jerry. I'm sorry.

287
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:05,754
It looked like he was wearing a skirt,
for crying out loud.

288
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:07,626
It has nothing to do
with the culottes.

289
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,394
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, Jerry.

290
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:16,870
I open up the paper, and this
is what I have to read about?

291
00:15:16,942 --> 00:15:18,839
I fell right off the toilet.

292
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,939
My back went out again.
I couldn't move.

293
00:15:23,015 --> 00:15:25,242
The super had to come
and help me up.

294
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:27,009
I was half-naked.

295
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:29,987
It's not true.

296
00:15:30,189 --> 00:15:32,723
Every day it's something else
with you.

297
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,916
I don't know anything
about you anymore.

298
00:15:34,993 --> 00:15:38,028
Who are you?
What kind of life are you leading?

299
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:42,858
Who knows what you're doing.
Maybe you're making porno films.

300
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:44,466
Yeah.

301
00:15:44,536 --> 00:15:45,898
I'm Buck Naked.

302
00:15:45,971 --> 00:15:49,268
You're who? Buck Naked?

303
00:15:49,341 --> 00:15:53,434
Jerry, I can see.
He's so neat and thin.

304
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:55,341
Not that there's anything
wrong with it.

305
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:57,243
Of course not.

306
00:16:00,052 --> 00:16:03,553
Six-thirty, Scott.
Time for your sponge bath.

307
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:10,593
Six-thirty already? I fell asleep.

308
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:15,290
Let me help you off with that.
Here, I'll Just slip it over your head.

309
00:16:19,972 --> 00:16:25,669
- The water's nice and warm, isn't it?
- Oh, that feels really good.

310
00:16:27,346 --> 00:16:30,381
George, are you
telling me the truth?

311
00:16:31,183 --> 00:16:33,774
George, I'm talking to you!

312
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,921
Guess who left a message
on my machine.

313
00:16:39,992 --> 00:16:43,550
That reporter from NYU.
I wonder what she wants.

314
00:16:47,432 --> 00:16:49,693
All right.
Now the play is tomorrow night.

315
00:16:49,768 --> 00:16:52,393
Would you like dinner first
or just meet at the theater?

316
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:54,937
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry to bother you.

317
00:16:55,007 --> 00:16:58,372
I want you to know that it took a lot
of guts to come out how you did...

318
00:16:58,443 --> 00:17:00,670
and that you've inspired me
to do the same...

319
00:17:00,746 --> 00:17:03,906
even though that may mean
a discharge from the service. Thanks.

320
00:17:13,091 --> 00:17:16,388
You know, I think I'll pass
on the Guys and Dolls.

321
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:18,123
All right, fine, don't go.

322
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:21,161
I try and go out and do something
special for your birthday...

323
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:24,200
and this is the thanks I get.
Everything's tainted now.

324
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:28,965
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No, I will not keep my voice down!

325
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:31,335
Nothing can make me keep
my voice down!

326
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:35,879
If you boys cannot
control yourselves...

327
00:17:35,948 --> 00:17:38,983
then I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

328
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,554
- Fine, I'll take Elaine.
- Yes.

329
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:53,459
Just don't say anything to Allison.

330
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:55,930
No, I won't.
Did she see the article?

331
00:17:56,001 --> 00:18:00,162
- No. Just imagine her reaction.
- Yeah.

332
00:18:00,439 --> 00:18:02,700
- Oh, my God.
- What?

333
00:18:02,908 --> 00:18:05,272
She hasn't seen the article.

334
00:18:05,577 --> 00:18:09,169
When she sees it,
she's gonna think...

335
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:13,380
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

336
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:20,516
Yeah, so?

337
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:22,057
"Yeah, so?"

338
00:18:22,127 --> 00:18:24,752
Well, this is nice.
They mention your name.

339
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,397
Don't you see what it says here?

340
00:18:26,465 --> 00:18:28,556
Don't you understand
what that's implying?

341
00:18:28,634 --> 00:18:30,565
No. What?

342
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:34,199
I'm gay. I'm a gay man.

343
00:18:34,273 --> 00:18:36,364
I'm very, very gay.

344
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:39,610
- You're gay?
- Extraordinarily gay.

345
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:41,575
Steeped in gayness.

346
00:18:43,181 --> 00:18:44,714
I don't believe it.

347
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:47,051
You don't believe me, ask Jerry.

348
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,315
- I will.
- What do you mean, you will?

349
00:18:49,388 --> 00:18:50,978
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.

350
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:55,684
- Jerry's a very private person.
- I wanna hear it from Jerry.

351
00:19:03,302 --> 00:19:05,267
Oh, can you ever forgive me?

352
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,697
I don't know.

353
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:17,579
All right, I forgive you.

354
00:19:18,517 --> 00:19:21,643
You know, the funny thing is,
I was attracted to you immediately.

355
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,311
I was attracted to you too.
You remind me of Lois Lane.

356
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:39,602
Jerry! Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

357
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,801
What?

358
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,933
You're with a woman!

359
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:47,440
I know. What are you doing here?

360
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:51,878
I leave you alone for two seconds,
and this is what you do?

361
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,075
I trusted you!

362
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:57,283
- Would you get the hell out of here?
- Stop it.

363
00:19:57,356 --> 00:19:59,754
- What..? What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?

364
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,256
All right. Tell her. Go ahead.

365
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,155
- Tell her what?
- You know, about us.

366
00:20:03,228 --> 00:20:05,228
- Are you crazy?
- Tell her, Jerry. Tell her.

367
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:07,865
I'm telling her nothing.
Do you know what you're saying?

368
00:20:07,933 --> 00:20:09,625
This... This is too weird.

369
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:12,497
Wait a minute. You wrote the article.
Go ahead. Tell her.

370
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:13,899
I'm out of here.

371
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:17,508
It's not true! It's not true!

372
00:20:17,576 --> 00:20:20,668
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

373
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,973
- You stupid idiot.
- Oh, please don't be upset.

374
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,175
Oh, would you stop it
with that stuff?

375
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:30,444
What's going on?

376
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,351
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

377
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:35,088
I'm not gay.

378
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,486
My name's Buck Naked.
I'm a porno actor.

379
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:47,770
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

380
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,272
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

381
00:20:52,444 --> 00:20:54,307
Hello.

382
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,848
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

383
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:59,709
All right, we'll see you later.

384
00:21:04,122 --> 00:21:06,816
He's the phone man.

385
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:13,459
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

386
00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:23,434
I am not gay.

387
00:21:24,676 --> 00:21:27,939
I am, however,
thin, single and neat.

388
00:21:28,013 --> 00:21:29,842
When someone is thin,
single and neat...

389
00:21:29,915 --> 00:21:32,609
people assume they're gay
because that's the stereotype.

390
00:21:32,684 --> 00:21:36,083
We normally don't think of gay people
as fat, sloppy and married.

391
00:21:36,354 --> 00:21:39,787
Although I'm sure there are, I don't
want to perpetuate the stereotype.

392
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:42,927
I'm sure they're the minority,
though, within the gay community.

393
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:46,120
Probably discriminated against.
Because of that, people say to them:

394
00:21:46,198 --> 00:21:48,391
"You know, Joe,
I enjoy being gay with you...

395
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:52,663
but it's about time you got in shape,
tucked your shirt in and lost the wife."

396
00:21:53,872 --> 00:21:56,497
If people are gonna assume
that neat people are gay...

397
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,336
instead of doing this:

398
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,171
"I think Joe might be a little..."

399
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:03,473
They should vacuum.
"You know, I think Joe might be..."

400
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,847
Yeah.

401
00:22:06,184 --> 00:22:09,344
I got a feeling he's a little...

401
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:16,476
