What are lawyers really?
2.329
1.000
**LOL**
2.354
To me, a lawyer is basically...
4.485
4.510
the person that knows
the rules of the country.
7.633
7.800
**LOL**
7.705
We're all throwing the dice,
playing the game...
10.069
10.174
moving our pieces around the
board, but if there's a problem...
13.209
13.310
the lawyer is the only person that
has read the inside top of the box.
17.244
18.415
I think one of the fun things
for them is to say "objection."
21.507
21.585
"Objection! Objection, Your Honor."
26.088
26.557
"Objection," of course,
is the adult version of "afraid not."
30.491
35.065
To which the judge
can say two things:
38.100
38.168
He can say "overruled," which
is the adult version of "afraid so."
42.898
43.640
Or he can say "sustained,"
which is the adult version of "duh."
47.676
47.650
**LOL**
53.300

# GEORGE
53.617
So... So you're a lawyer.
56.049
56.587
What kind of cases
do you handle?
58.177
# CHERYL
58.255
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents,
immigration and naturalization.
62.314
# GEORGE
62.593
What is that? Immigrants come over,
you show them how to act natural?
66.129
# CHERYL
68.499
Are your friends as funny as you?
70.294
# GEORGE
70.968
No, they're not funny at all.
No. I have no funny friends.
74.128
74.700
**LOL**
74.204
I'm the funny one. El Clown-o.

# JERRY
80.377
Hey, I've been back four days.
I want my mail.
82.672
# ELAINE
82.746
It's mostly bills, magazines
and junk mail anyway.
85.337
# JERRY
85.416
Elaine, that's what mail is.
87.416
87.484
Without bills, magazines
and junk mail, there is no mail.
90.417

 Hi.
99.679
# JERRY
99.679
 Hey, how you doing?
100.463
# GEORGE
100.531
You would not believe
what just happened.
102.565
102.633
I was waiting for you, and this woman
was sitting at the counter.
105.827
# ELAINE
105.903
 What, the one who just left?
106.732
# GEORGE
106.732
 Yeah.
107.561
107.638
And so we started talking...
109.035
109.106
and she's this lawyer,
who's incredible.
111.140
111.208
You know,
everything I said was funny.
112.969
113.043
She laughed at everything I said.
She thinks I'm hilarious.
116.476
116.980
You know, in a way,
it was almost too good.
119.207
119.283
I started so good, I can't go anyplace
but down now, you know.
122.875
121.950
**LOL**
123.253
I got no place to go.
124.980

 It is. Hey, Babu!
133.513
# BABU
133.513
 Jerry.
135.531
# JERRY
135.599
Look at you. You got the job.
137.462
# BABU
137.534
 Yes, they give me job, thanks to you.
139.034
# JERRY
139.034
 Oh, I didn't do anything.
140.535
# BABU
140.604
No, you do everything. Get me job,
get me place to live in your building.
143.935
# JERRY
144.007
 Come on.
144.740
# BABU
144.740
 You very good man.
145.472
145.542
 Stop.
146.326
146.326
 You did everything for me.
147.109
147.177
I can never thank you enough
for everything you do.
149.575
149.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
149.680
You see, this is what I do
with women.
151.873
151.949
I start out too strong.
154.017
154.084
Now I have to become real.
That's when it all falls apart.
156.982
157.754
What good is real? They don't
want real. They want funny.
160.755
# ELAINE
160.824
 No, they don't. No.
162.171
# GEORGE
162.171
 Oh, yes, they do, Elaine.
163.518
# ELAINE
# GEORGE
163.594
Oh, you gotta put on a show. You
always gotta give them a big show.
166.788
166.864
You always have to be on.
Otherwise, why would they like me?
169.831
169.900
They'd just go for a better-looking
guy with more money.
173.265
175.550
**LOL**
# GEORGE
175.172
You mean that's true? I'm right?
176.739
# JERRY
176.807
Okay, great. Well, I'm glad
everything worked out, Babu.
179.375
# BABU
179.443
 Yes. Everything wonderful.
181.006
# JERRY
181.006
 I'll see you around the building.
182.569
# BABU
182.646
I'll see you in the building.
184.941
# JERRY
185.349
 Remember Babu Bhatt?
186.582
# GEORGE
186.582
 Who's he?
187.815
# JERRY
188.118
Remember that guy, opened
the restaurant across the street...
190.880
190.954
from the building last year
and he wasn't doing so well?
193.648
193.757
I told him he should make it
into all-Pakistani.
196.052
196.126
 It drove him right out of business.
197.143
197.143
 Right.
198.160
198.200
**LOL**
198.829
So you going with me
to the auto show Saturday?
201.090
# ELAINE
201.165
 Yeah, yeah.
202.330
# JERRY
202.330
 Can you bring my mail then please?
203.495
# GEORGE
203.567
 What mail?
204.647
# ELAINE
204.647
 I picked up his mail...
205.726
205.802
while he was on the road.
207.183
# GEORGE
207.183
 Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
208.564
# JERRY
208.639
Because he was at that baseball
fantasy camp in Florida.
211.333
# GEORGE
211.408
Oh, yeah, right.
When's he coming back?
214.136
# JERRY
214.211
 Monday, I think.
216.161
# GEORGE
216.161
 Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.
218.111
218.182
His whole life is a fantasy camp.
220.910
220.800
**LOL**
220.984
People should plunk down $2000
to live like him for a week.
225.111
224.450
**LOL**
225.222
Do nothing,
fall ass backwards in the money...
227.847
227.925
mooch food off your neighbors
and have sex without dating.
230.789
230.861
That's a fantasy camp.
232.588

**LOL**
# JERRY
233.697
Listen, if you're gonna go out
with this lawyer, have dinner with us...
236.823
236.900
then maybe you can go
to the auto show with her if you want.
239.798
239.870
Have a little company.
Take the pressure off.

259.287
# GEORGE
262.292
 No. No, I don't... I don't think so.
264.190
# ELAINE
264.190
 Why?
266.089
# GEORGE
266.163
Well, I think I'm better off
going one-on-one.
269.255
# JERRY
269.433
I don't know why you wanna play
man-to-man when you could play zone.
272.934
273.850

274.504
She might not be comfortable.
275.935

276.006
Why? We're all very nice.
We're very friendly.
278.301
# JERRY
278.375
 We'll be funny.

 No. No.

280.544
It's not good. I don't think so.
282.771
# ELAINE
282.980
All right. If you change your mind,
we'll wind up at Isabella's around 7.
286.846
# JERRY
286.917
No. No Isabella's.
I don't want to go to Isabella's.
289.349
# ELAINE
289.419
 Why?

Toasting makes me uncomfortable.
308.126

But toast I love.

310.240
Never start the day
without a good piece of toast.

The turbo quadramatic transmission...

Why don't we put
these tables together.
363.220

You can't do that. They're round.
It makes an eight, and it just...

No, George, it's so funny. We saw
this cab driver's picture, right?
379.699
# GEORGE
379.776
You know, we should really order.
381.468
381.545
The service is so slow here.
By the time you get anything...
384.842
# ELAINE
385.148
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you
a legal question?
388.081
388.385
 I'm being sued.
389.419
# CHERYL
389.419
 Oh, what happened?
390.453

Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin,
and I crossed against the light...
396.085
395.300
**LOL**
397.194
and I knocked over
the delivery boy.
399.762
# CHERYL

Was he Chinese?

 Oh, my God.

 Oh, God.

I can't believe it.
This is such a coincidence.

I know.
425.881
# ELAINE
426.356
Wow. Well, I...

I guess you don't have any advice
for me on how to win the case.

# CHERYL

Will you excuse me?
I have to make a call.

broken the case wide open.

 What?

 This is not good. This is not good.
456.885
# JERRY
456.953
 What's the matter?
458.237
# GEORGE
458.237
 I don't think it's a great idea...
459.521
459.589
 for you to sit here.
460.452
# JERRY
460.452
 Why not?
461.316
# ELAINE
461.391
He thinks if you're too funny,
he might not look so funny.

# JERRY
464.127
Biff.
465.489
466.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
466.129
What?
467.457
# JERRY
467.531
 You're not worried about that?
469.128
# GEORGE
469.128
 No, of course not.
470.725
# JERRY
470.801
I mean, so what if I'm funny.
Who cares?
473.131
# ELAINE
473.203
He thinks that if a woman
sees a guy put on a better show...
476.295
476.373
she'll walk out on his show,
go see the other show.
479.931
480.450
**LOL**
# JERRY
480.544
Well, should we leave?
481.770
# GEORGE
481.845
Well, maybe you don't have
to be so funny.
484.413
484.481
Would it kill you
not to be so funny all the time?
486.776
486.900
**LOL**
486.850
That's all I'm asking.
488.076
488.151
This woman thinks I'm very funny.
489.718
489.786
Now you're gonna be funny,
so, what am I gonna be?
492.013
492.088
I'll be a short, bald guy with glasses
who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
496.318
496.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
497.461
This is so ridiculous.
Can we just go over there?
501.497
# JERRY
501.565
Look, I don't have to be funny.
I don't care.
504.327
# GEORGE
504.401
 You don't?
505.031
# JERRY
505.031
 No way.
505.661
505.735
It's completely under my control.
507.496
# ELAINE
507.871
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
511.338
# JERRY
511.408
Of course I can.
Am I being funny now?
513.305
512.100

514.277
A little.

George, is this funny?
521.181
# GEORGE
521.518
It's funny.

And it wouldn't kill you to not
be so funny either.

546.610
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic
of how another year has gone by...
550.612
550.850
**LOL**
551.681
and how little we've grown.
553.612
554.484
No matter how desperate we are
that someday...
556.575
556.653
a better self will emerge, each flicker
of the candles on the cake...
559.950
560.023
we know it's not to be.
561.488
561.650

inevitably, irrevocably.
572.463

Here, take it.
I was glad to get rid of it.
588.016
# JERRY
588.084
Well, thank you very much.
It's about time.
590.709
# ELAINE
591.421
Oh, listen. So guess what.
593.250
593.456
Cheryl convinced Ping
to drop the case against me.
597.356
# JERRY
597.427
Drop the case?
599.119
599.195
Wow, congratulations.
That will save you some money.
601.593
# ELAINE
601.665
Yeah. No kidding. That lawyer
was gonna charge me a fortune.
604.563
# JERRY
604.734
Oh, great. Birth announcement

Thought you weren't
coming back till Monday.
619.846
619.700
**LOL**
# KRAMER
623.486
Well, the camp ended
a few days early.
626.453
# JERRY
628.158
Why?
629.555
# KRAMER
629.626
Well, there was an incident.
631.250
631.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
632.462
What happened?
633.790
# KRAMER
633.863
I punched Mickey Mantle
in the mouth.
637.091
637.350
**LOL**
# JERRY
637.734
 What?
638.518
# KRAMER
638.518
 Yeah, I punched him...
639.301
639.369
and they took him
to the hospital...
641.164
641.237
and then they canceled
the rest of the week.
643.498
# ELAINE
643.573
You punched who in the mouth?
645.265
# KRAMER
645.342
Mickey Mantle.
647.000
647.250
**LOL**
# JERRY
647.978
What happened?
649.102
# KRAMER
649.179
Well, you know,
we were playing a game...
651.110
651.181
and I was pitching.
I was really throwing some smoke.
654.148
654.284
And Joe Pepitone, he was up...
656.477
656.553
and, man, that guy,
he was crowding the plate.
659.213
# JERRY
659.289
Wow, Joe Pepitone.
660.720
# KRAMER
660.790
Well, Joe Pepitone or not,
I own the inside of that plate.
663.688
663.950
**LOL**
663.760
So, you know,
I throw one inside, you know.
666.852
666.930
A little chin music
right on his pants...
669.897
669.966
because I gotta intimidate,
you know, when I'm on the mound.
672.967
673.350
**LOL**
673.036
Well, the next pitch,
he's right back in the same place.
676.128
676.206
So I had to plunk him.
679.070
678.850
**LOL**
# JERRY
680.110
 You plunked him?
680.905
# KRAMER
680.905
 Oh, yeah.
681.700
681.778
Well, he throws down his bat,
he comes racing up to the mound.
685.405
685.482
Next thing,
both benches are cleared, you know.
687.812
687.884
A brouhaha breaks out between
the guys in the camp, you know...
690.782
690.854
and the old Yankee players.
692.285
692.355
As I'm trying to get Moose Skowron
off of one of my teammates...
695.356
695.425
somebody pulls me from behind...
697.254
697.327
and I turned around
and I popped him.
700.191
700.263
I looked down and whoa, man!
It's Mickey.
703.355
703.350
**LOL**
705.168
I punched his lights out.
706.530
# JERRY
706.936
Wow, this is incredible.
708.435
# BABU
708.705
Leave me alone!
You can't do this to me.
711.831
# JERRY
711.941
What's going on out there?
713.201
# BABU
713.276
What are you doing?
714.400
714.477
This is not right, people. You're
making a very bad mistake. Very bad.
718.479
# JERRY
718.548
Babu. I'll be right back.
720.843
# ELAINE
720.917
 Yeah, so...
721.996
# KRAMER
721.996
 Hank Bauer, he's screaming:
723.076
723.153
"Mickey! What have you done
with Mickey! You killed Mickey!"
726.586
727.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
728.091
 So, what did you do?
729.705
# KRAMER
729.705
 Well, I got the hell out of there.
731.319
731.950
**LOL**
# JERRY
732.328
They took Babu away.
733.861
# ELAINE
733.930
They took Babu away?
735.588
# JERRY
735.665
Yeah, the immigration guy
said his visa was expired.
738.427
738.501
Poor Babu. Everything was going
so well for him.
740.967
741.037
He had an apartment, he had a job.
742.832
742.906
 What a shame.
744.201
# BABU
744.201
 Jerry!
745.497

746.876
Help me!
748.773
# JERRY
748.845
I will, Babu!
I will help you, Babu! Don't worry!
754.474
# KRAMER
754.918
Then Hank Bauer, you know,
he's chasing me around.
757.384
757.454
He trips over third base
and knocks over Clete Boyer.
760.546
760.650
**LOL**
# JERRY
# ELAINE
761.424
What?
762.855
# JERRY
763.293
 Well, this is interesting.
764.708
# ELAINE
764.708
 What is it?
766.123
# JERRY
766.196
It's a letter
from the Immigration Bureau.
768.594
768.665
It's Babu's
visa-renewal application form.
772.701
774.037
They must have put it
in my mailbox by mistake.
776.264
# KRAMER
776.506
Well, doesn't he need that?
779.074
779.500

If you'd given me my mail last week,
this never would have happened.
791.548
# ELAINE
791.621
Well, you should have come
to my house to pick it up.
794.087
# JERRY
794.157
 So am I being funny now?

795.356
 No, actually, you're not.

See, I told you I wasn't funny
all the time.
799.320

Hey, George, look,
I'm not funny now.
801.924
802.350
**LOL**
# GEORGE
802.031
No, and you weren't funny last night.
You got us both so depressed...
806.033
806.102
she asked me to drive
her home after dinner.
808.329
# JERRY
808.404
I need to get in touch with Cheryl.
810.062
810.140
Babu needs a lawyer.
His visa's expired.
811.969
# GEORGE
812.041
There's a million lawyers.
813.472
# JERRY
813.543
Yeah, but you said this is one
of the things that her firm does.
816.669
# GEORGE
816.746
All right, but no funny business.
Same deal as last night.
819.781
# JERRY
819.849
 Will you stop it already.
821.412
# GEORGE
821.412
 Jerry, please.
822.975
# JERRY
823.052
How long is this gonna go on?
824.551
# GEORGE
825.355
Till I'm comfortable.
826.752
# JERRY
826.823
Well, when is that gonna be?
828.914
827.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
828.992
After consummation.
830.957
# JERRY
831.528
Consummation? I don't think
you have enough material.

856.779
# JERRY
858.588
Well, with so many people
in the world deprived and unhappy...
862.715
862.792
it doesn't seem like it would
be fair to be cheerful.
866.692
867.350
**LOL**
# CHERYL
873.369
I understand.
875.096
# CHERYL
875.805
I think that's curdled.

# CHERYL
919.048
After we met, you were all so nice,
I just couldn't go through with it.
922.584
922.652
But between you and me, you would
have paid through the nose.
925.516

957.033
# BABU
957.033
 See...
958.180
958.254
the problem is, I never got my
visa-renewal form in the mail.
961.187
961.257
 I was expecting it.
963.588
# JERRY
963.588
 Yes. See, here's the thing, Babu.
965.919
965.995
What happened was...
967.494
967.563
I was away for a couple of weeks
doing some comedy shows.
970.325
# BABU
970.400
The comedy shows,
you're very funny man.
972.559
# JERRY
973.269
Well, Elaine, here, was picking up
my mail while I was away...
976.964
977.040
because that little box
can get very full.
979.233
# BABU
979.309
Yes, of course.
TV Guide, magazines, everything.
981.673
981.811
I would have picked up your mail.
983.378
983.446
 Your box is right next to mine.
984.844
# JERRY
984.844
 I don't want to bother you.
986.242
# BABU
986.316
No bother. You get me job. You get
me apartment, you very good man.
989.908
990.050
**LOL**
# JERRY
989.986
Well, yesterday,
after they took you away...
992.680
992.755
I looked in my mail,
and I noticed that the mailman...
995.380
995.458
accidentally put your
visa-renewal in my mailbox.
998.959
# BABU
999.028
Come again?
1000.254
1000.550
**LOL**
# JERRY
1000.330
See, I've been home for a week...
1001.897
1001.965
and Elaine didn't give me my mail
till yesterday...
1004.465
1004.534
even though
I asked her repeatedly for it.
1007.398
1007.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1007.470
Yeah, but, Babu, he could have come
to my house to pick it up.
1011.301
# BABU
1011.374
You had my visa application?
1013.101
# JERRY
1013.176
 Well, not technically.
1014.005
# BABU
1014.005
 I kill you!
1014.834

1015.111
 What about her?
1016.008
1015.750
**LOL**
# BABU

1017.627
# BABU
1017.627
 No Babu.
1018.274
1018.348
No Babu. You're bad man.
You're very bad man.
1020.916
1020.984
You're very lazy, bad man.
1022.415
1021.550
**LOL**
# JERRY
1022.485
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything.
1024.212
1024.287
I have a lawyer who knows someone
in the immigration department.
1027.220
1027.290
They'll straighten the whole thing out.
The wheels are in motion.

1040.964
# CHERYL
1041.037
I'm very attracted to him.
1042.468
# GEORGE
1042.638
You think the person
you were talking to was him?
1045.434
1045.508
That's not even close to him.
He's funny. Jerry's funny.
1050.102
# CHERYL
1050.179
 He's never said anything funny.
1051.776
# GEORGE
1051.776
 He can't not be funny.
1053.373
# CHERYL
1053.449
No, no. He's dark and disturbed.
1058.612
# GEORGE
1058.688
Dark and disturbed?
1061.450
1061.524
His whole life revolves around
Superman and cereal.
1064.616
1065.600
**LOL**
1065.161
What kind of a friend are you?
1066.956
1067.030
I convinced him to act like that so
that you would think I was funnier.
1070.827
1070.900
That's how disturbed I am.
1073.025
1073.102
You want disturbed?
That's disturbed.
1075.329
1073.850
**LOL**
1075.405
I mean, you can't find sickness
like that anywhere.
1078.030
1078.107
You think sickness like that
grows on trees?
1080.402
1080.476
Nobody is sicker than me. Nobody.
1082.737
1082.812
He's pretending.
I am the genuine article.
1085.073
# CHERYL
1085.148
You're telling me Jerry's whole thing
was an act?
1087.842
1085.850
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1087.917
And I put him up to it,
because I'm sick.
1091.384
1091.454
I'm the one that needs help.
1093.818
1092.150
**LOL**
# CHERYL
1095.725
I gotta go.
1096.985
# GEORGE
1097.360
Well, should I call you later?
1099.724
# CHERYL
1099.796
Please don't.
1100.988
# GEORGE
1101.064
But... But I'm disturbed.
I'm depressed.
1104.759
1104.834
I'm inadequate. I got it all!

So, what's up with Babu?
How come he's not back?
1114.973
# JERRY
1115.044
I don't know. I don't understand it.
1117.044
1117.113
Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it. He should be back by now.
1120.705

I'm sure the lawyer
did everything they could.
1138.590
1138.668
Then where is Babu?
What happened to Babu?
1141.532
1141.604
Show me Babu!
1143.729
1144.150
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1145.541
 Snapple?
1146.524
1146.524
 No.
1147.506
1149.378
Too fruity.
1151.207
1151.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
1155.518
Hey, what happened?
1156.915
1156.986
I thought Cheryl
was gonna help Babu get his visa.
1159.281
# GEORGE
1159.355
 She didn't help him?
1160.338
# JERRY
1160.338
 No.
1161.320
# GEORGE
1161.390
 Where is he?
1162.589
# JERRY
1162.589
 He's in Pakistan.
1163.788
# GEORGE
1164.594
Oh, boy
1165.718
# JERRY
1166.062
What do you mean, "Oh, boy"?
1167.754
# GEORGE
1167.830
Well, last night she told me
that she liked you.
1172.390
1172.468
Not you, the disturbed you.
1174.729
1175.050
**LOL**
1175.438
So I had to tell her the truth.
1177.267
# JERRY
1177.340
You told her the truth?
Well, you got Babu deported!
1179.738
# GEORGE
1179.809
What do you mean I "got"? You didn't
give him his visa application.
1183.003
# JERRY
1183.079
That's because she had my mail.
1184.544
1184.350
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1184.614
Well, I wouldn't have to get your mail
if he didn't go to that fantasy camp.
1188.150
# KRAMER
1188.217
Well, I just came back
from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
1191.081
# JERRY
1191.154
How could you go in there?
1192.949
# KRAMER
1193.022
Well, I had to. I had to apologize.
1195.852
1195.958
I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,
my idol.
1198.458
1198.528
It was eating me up inside!
1200.653
1200.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
1201.130
Well, what happened?
1202.356
# KRAMER
1202.431
I got down on my knees, and I went,
"Go ahead, Mickey, hit me.
1205.295
1205.368
I'm begging you, Mickey.
Please, hit me. Come on, hit me.
1208.460
1208.538
I love you, Mickey. I love you."
1210.799
1210.700
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1210.873
So, what did he do?
1212.270
# KRAMER
1212.341
Well, the four of them, they picked
me up by my pants...
1215.308
1215.378
and they threw me outside,
right into a horse.
1218.311
1218.600
**LOL**
# VOICE
1221.050

1221.697
 Hey!
1222.344
1222.418
Yeah. It's my Chinese food.
1224.816
# ELAINE
1224.887
Oh, Ping. Hi.
1227.046
1227.123
Listen, thank you so much
for dropping that lawsuit against me.
1230.590
# PING
1230.660
 Not anymore.
1231.723
# ELAINE
1231.723
 What?
1232.785
# PING
1232.862
Cheryl call me last night.
Lawsuit back on.
1235.829
# ELAINE
1235.898
Why?
1237.329
1236.450
**LOL**
# PING
1237.400
She call you
and your friends big liars.
1239.832
1239.902
You think she nice girl?
1241.867
1241.938
Wait till you see her in court.
She's a shark!
1245.405
1245.450
**LOL**
1245.474
They call her "The Terminator."
1247.974
1248.044
She never lose a case,
and now you make her mad.
1252.672
1252.748
She doubled the damages.
1255.043
1255.117
Hasta la vista, baby.
1258.550
1257.850
**LOL**
# BABU
1264.460
So his friend had the mail,
but she did not give it to him.
1267.825
1267.997
And then he came to visit me...
1269.496
1269.565
said a lawyer would call and help.
He said the wheels were in motion.
1273.465
1273.850
**LOL**
1273.536
But there was no motion.
There was nothing.
1276.969
1277.039
And so they sent me back here.
1279.334
1279.609
This is a terrible story, Babu.
1281.939
1282.050
**LOL**
1282.478
What are you going to do?
1284.045
# BABU
1284.113
I'm going to save up every rupee...
1287.011
1287.083
for someday...
1288.673
1288.751
I will get back to America,
and when I do...
1292.287
1292.355
I will exact vengeance
on this man.
1295.185
1295.150
**LOL**
1295.324
I cannot forget him.
1297.119
1297.193
He haunts me.
1299.158
1299.362
He's a very bad man.
He's a very, very bad man.
1305.958
1301.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
1306.302
I am for open immigration...
1307.835
1307.903
but that sign we have
on the Statue of Liberty:
1310.369
1310.439
"Give us your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses."
1313.736
1313.809
Can't we just say, "Hey, the door's
open, we'll take whoever you got."
1317.401
1316.800
**LOL**
1317.480
Do we have to specify
the "wretched refuse"?
1321.311
1321.384
I mean, why don't we just say:
1322.815
1322.050
**LOL**
1322.885
"Give us the unhappy, the sad,
the slow, the ugly...
1325.476
1325.588
people that can't drive,
that they have trouble merging...
1328.384
1328.457
if they can't stay in their lane,
don't signal, can't parallel park...
1332.015
1332.094
if they're sneezing, if they're
stuffed up, if they're clogged...
1335.220
1335.298
if they have bad penmanship, don't
return calls, if they have dandruff...
1338.959
1339.035
food between their teeth, if they have
bad credit, if they have no credit...
1343.663
1343.739
missed a spot shaving."
In other words...
1346.000
1351.700

1372.900

1383.150
