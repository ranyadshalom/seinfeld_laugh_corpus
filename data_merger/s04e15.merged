What are lawyers really?
**LOL**
To me, a lawyer is basically...
the person that knows
the rules of the country.
**LOL**
We're all throwing the dice,
playing the game...
moving our pieces around the
board, but if there's a problem...
the lawyer is the only person that
has read the inside top of the box.
I think one of the fun things
for them is to say "objection."
"Objection! Objection, Your Honor."
"Objection," of course,
is the adult version of "afraid not."
To which the judge
can say two things:
He can say "overruled," which
is the adult version of "afraid so."
Or he can say "sustained,"
which is the adult version of "duh."
**LOL**
**LOL**
# GEORGE
So... So you're a lawyer.
What kind of cases
do you handle?
# CHERYL
Oh, everything. Divorce, patents,
immigration and naturalization.
# GEORGE
What is that? Immigrants come over,
you show them how to act natural?
# CHERYL
Are your friends as funny as you?
# GEORGE
No, they're not funny at all.
No. I have no funny friends.
**LOL**
I'm the funny one. El Clown-o.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Look, I was nice enough
to pick it up for you.
# JERRY
Hey, I've been back four days.
I want my mail.
# ELAINE
It's mostly bills, magazines
and junk mail anyway.
# JERRY
Elaine, that's what mail is.
Without bills, magazines
and junk mail, there is no mail.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# CHERYL
 Here's my card.
# GEORGE
 Oh, okay. Thank you.
 Hey, good talking to you.
# CHERYL
 Nice meeting you.
# GEORGE
# ELAINE
 Hi.
# JERRY
 Hey, how you doing?
# GEORGE
You would not believe
what just happened.
I was waiting for you, and this woman
was sitting at the counter.
# ELAINE
 What, the one who just left?
# GEORGE
 Yeah.
And so we started talking...
and she's this lawyer,
who's incredible.
You know,
everything I said was funny.
She laughed at everything I said.
She thinks I'm hilarious.
You know, in a way,
it was almost too good.
I started so good, I can't go anyplace
but down now, you know.
**LOL**
I got no place to go.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Yeah, well, guess it's all over.
# JERRY
Hey, is that Babu?
 It is. Hey, Babu!
# BABU
 Jerry.
# JERRY
Look at you. You got the job.
# BABU
 Yes, they give me job, thanks to you.
# JERRY
 Oh, I didn't do anything.
# BABU
No, you do everything. Get me job,
get me place to live in your building.
# JERRY
 Come on.
# BABU
 You very good man.
 Stop.
 You did everything for me.
I can never thank you enough
for everything you do.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
You see, this is what I do
with women.
I start out too strong.
Now I have to become real.
That's when it all falls apart.
What good is real? They don't
want real. They want funny.
# ELAINE
 No, they don't. No.
# GEORGE
 Oh, yes, they do, Elaine.
# ELAINE
# GEORGE
Oh, you gotta put on a show. You
always gotta give them a big show.
You always have to be on.
Otherwise, why would they like me?
They'd just go for a better-looking
guy with more money.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
You mean that's true? I'm right?
# JERRY
Okay, great. Well, I'm glad
everything worked out, Babu.
# BABU
 Yes. Everything wonderful.
# JERRY
 I'll see you around the building.
# BABU
I'll see you in the building.
# JERRY
 Remember Babu Bhatt?
# GEORGE
 Who's he?
# JERRY
Remember that guy, opened
the restaurant across the street...
from the building last year
and he wasn't doing so well?
I told him he should make it
into all-Pakistani.
 It drove him right out of business.
 Right.
**LOL**
So you going with me
to the auto show Saturday?
# ELAINE
 Yeah, yeah.
# JERRY
 Can you bring my mail then please?
# GEORGE
 What mail?
# ELAINE
 I picked up his mail...
while he was on the road.
# GEORGE
 Why didn't Kramer pick it up?
# JERRY
Because he was at that baseball
fantasy camp in Florida.
# GEORGE
Oh, yeah, right.
When's he coming back?
# JERRY
 Monday, I think.
# GEORGE
 Kramer goes to a fantasy camp.
His whole life is a fantasy camp.
**LOL**
People should plunk down $2000
to live like him for a week.
**LOL**
Do nothing,
fall ass backwards in the money...
mooch food off your neighbors
and have sex without dating.
That's a fantasy camp.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Listen, if you're gonna go out
with this lawyer, have dinner with us...
then maybe you can go
to the auto show with her if you want.
Have a little company.
Take the pressure off.
**LOL**
# JERRY
He never heard of corduroy!
# CHERYL
Stop it, you're killing me!
**LOL**
# JERRY
Never heard of corduroy.
True story. True story.
**LOL**
Funny.
# GEORGE
 No. No, I don't... I don't think so.
# ELAINE
 Why?
# GEORGE
Well, I think I'm better off
going one-on-one.
# JERRY
I don't know why you wanna play
man-to-man when you could play zone.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
She might not be comfortable.
# ELAINE
Why? We're all very nice.
We're very friendly.
# JERRY
 We'll be funny.
# GEORGE
 No. No.
**LOL**
It's not good. I don't think so.
# ELAINE
All right. If you change your mind,
we'll wind up at Isabella's around 7.
# JERRY
No. No Isabella's.
I don't want to go to Isabella's.
# ELAINE
 Why?
# JERRY
 No, it's too trendy. No Isabella's.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Excellent.
Like I really know
what I'm talking about.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Toasting makes me uncomfortable.
But toast I love.
Never start the day
without a good piece of toast.
**LOL**
In fact, let's toast to toast.
# JERRY
Look who's here. Georgie boy.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
What are you doing here? I thought
you said you hated Isabella's.
# ELAINE
No, I talked him into it.
# GEORGE
What happened to the auto show?
# JERRY
Oh, we're still going. Still going.
Elaine, do the spokesmodel.
# ELAINE
The turbo quadramatic transmission...
offers you the power and prestige
to propel you...
well into the 21 st century.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Hi.
 Hi.
# GEORGE
 Cheryl, this is Elaine and Jerry.
# JERRY
Hi. Nice to meet you.
# CHERYL
 Would you like to join us?
# GEORGE
 No, no. They don't wanna join us.
# CHERYL
 No, it's okay. Don't be silly.
 Okay.
# ELAINE
Why don't we put
these tables together.
# GEORGE
You can't do that. They're round.
It makes an eight, and it just...
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Jerry. Jerry, tell them that
funny story you were telling me...
# GEORGE
No. No.
# ELAINE
No, George, it's so funny. We saw
this cab driver's picture, right?
# GEORGE
You know, we should really order.
The service is so slow here.
By the time you get anything...
# ELAINE
Oh, Cheryl, can I ask you
a legal question?
 I'm being sued.
# CHERYL
 Oh, what happened?
# ELAINE
Well, I ran out to apologize to a virgin,
and I crossed against the light...
**LOL**
and I knocked over
the delivery boy.
# CHERYL
Was he Chinese?
# ELAINE
Yeah.
# CHERYL
Is your..? Is your last name "Benes"?
# JERRY
 How did you know?
# CHERYL
 Oh, God! Ping is my cousin.
# ELAINE
No.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 That's so funny.
# CHERYL
 I'm handling his case.
# ELAINE
What?
 You're Cheryl Fong?
# CHERYL
 That's right.
# ELAINE
 Oh, my God.
 Oh, God.
I can't believe it.
This is such a coincidence.
# CHERYL
I know.
# ELAINE
Wow. Well, I...
I guess you don't have any advice
for me on how to win the case.
**LOL**
# CHERYL
Will you excuse me?
I have to make a call.
# ELAINE
Tell Ping I said hello.
# JERRY
Tell him you think you may have
broken the case wide open.
I can't believe it.
# GEORGE
What are you doing?
What are you doing?
**LOL**
# JERRY
 What?
# GEORGE
 This is not good. This is not good.
# JERRY
 What's the matter?
# GEORGE
 I don't think it's a great idea...
 for you to sit here.
# JERRY
 Why not?
# ELAINE
He thinks if you're too funny,
he might not look so funny.
# JERRY
Biff.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
What?
# JERRY
 You're not worried about that?
# GEORGE
 No, of course not.
# JERRY
I mean, so what if I'm funny.
Who cares?
# ELAINE
He thinks that if a woman
sees a guy put on a better show...
she'll walk out on his show,
go see the other show.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Well, should we leave?
# GEORGE
Well, maybe you don't have
to be so funny.
Would it kill you
not to be so funny all the time?
**LOL**
That's all I'm asking.
This woman thinks I'm very funny.
Now you're gonna be funny,
so, what am I gonna be?
I'll be a short, bald guy with glasses
who suddenly doesn't seem so funny.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
This is so ridiculous.
Can we just go over there?
# JERRY
Look, I don't have to be funny.
I don't care.
# GEORGE
 You don't?
# JERRY
 No way.
It's completely under my control.
# ELAINE
No, it's not. You cannot not be funny.
# JERRY
Of course I can.
Am I being funny now?
**LOL**
# ELAINE
A little.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Oh, this is funny? I'm being funny?
# ELAINE
Yeah.
# JERRY
George, is this funny?
# GEORGE
It's funny.
And it wouldn't kill you to not
be so funny either.
# ELAINE
What? What did I do?
# GEORGE
 Hi.
 Hi.
# JERRY
Hello.
**LOL**
Welcome back.
# CHERYL
I'm sorry. It was my aunt's birthday.
She makes such a big deal about it.
# ELAINE
Well, nobody likes to get old, right?
# JERRY
Well, birthdays are merely symbolic
of how another year has gone by...
**LOL**
and how little we've grown.
No matter how desperate we are
that someday...
a better self will emerge, each flicker
of the candles on the cake...
we know it's not to be.
**LOL**
But for the rest of our sad,
wretched, pathetic lives...
**LOL**
this is who we are to the bitter end...
inevitably, irrevocably.
**LOL**
Happy birthday? No such thing.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Funny guy, huh?
# ELAINE
Here, take it.
I was glad to get rid of it.
# JERRY
Well, thank you very much.
It's about time.
# ELAINE
Oh, listen. So guess what.
Cheryl convinced Ping
to drop the case against me.
# JERRY
Drop the case?
Wow, congratulations.
That will save you some money.
# ELAINE
Yeah. No kidding. That lawyer
was gonna charge me a fortune.
# JERRY
Oh, great. Birth announcement
from Arnie and Joy Harris.
# JERRY
Hear that? Guess who's back.
# KRAMER
# JERRY
Thought you weren't
coming back till Monday.
**LOL**
# KRAMER
Well, the camp ended
a few days early.
# JERRY
Why?
# KRAMER
Well, there was an incident.
**LOL**
# JERRY
What happened?
# KRAMER
I punched Mickey Mantle
in the mouth.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 What?
# KRAMER
 Yeah, I punched him...
and they took him
to the hospital...
and then they canceled
the rest of the week.
# ELAINE
You punched who in the mouth?
# KRAMER
Mickey Mantle.
**LOL**
# JERRY
What happened?
# KRAMER
Well, you know,
we were playing a game...
and I was pitching.
I was really throwing some smoke.
And Joe Pepitone, he was up...
and, man, that guy,
he was crowding the plate.
# JERRY
Wow, Joe Pepitone.
# KRAMER
Well, Joe Pepitone or not,
I own the inside of that plate.
**LOL**
So, you know,
I throw one inside, you know.
A little chin music
right on his pants...
because I gotta intimidate,
you know, when I'm on the mound.
**LOL**
Well, the next pitch,
he's right back in the same place.
So I had to plunk him.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 You plunked him?
# KRAMER
 Oh, yeah.
Well, he throws down his bat,
he comes racing up to the mound.
Next thing,
both benches are cleared, you know.
A brouhaha breaks out between
the guys in the camp, you know...
and the old Yankee players.
As I'm trying to get Moose Skowron
off of one of my teammates...
somebody pulls me from behind...
and I turned around
and I popped him.
I looked down and whoa, man!
It's Mickey.
**LOL**
I punched his lights out.
# JERRY
Wow, this is incredible.
# BABU
Leave me alone!
You can't do this to me.
# JERRY
What's going on out there?
# BABU
What are you doing?
This is not right, people. You're
making a very bad mistake. Very bad.
# JERRY
Babu. I'll be right back.
# ELAINE
 Yeah, so...
# KRAMER
 Hank Bauer, he's screaming:
"Mickey! What have you done
with Mickey! You killed Mickey!"
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 So, what did you do?
# KRAMER
 Well, I got the hell out of there.
**LOL**
# JERRY
They took Babu away.
# ELAINE
They took Babu away?
# JERRY
Yeah, the immigration guy
said his visa was expired.
Poor Babu. Everything was going
so well for him.
He had an apartment, he had a job.
 What a shame.
# BABU
 Jerry!
**LOL**
Help me!
# JERRY
I will, Babu!
I will help you, Babu! Don't worry!
# KRAMER
Then Hank Bauer, you know,
he's chasing me around.
He trips over third base
and knocks over Clete Boyer.
**LOL**
# JERRY
# ELAINE
What?
# JERRY
 Well, this is interesting.
# ELAINE
 What is it?
# JERRY
It's a letter
from the Immigration Bureau.
It's Babu's
visa-renewal application form.
They must have put it
in my mailbox by mistake.
# KRAMER
Well, doesn't he need that?
**LOL**
# JERRY
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday
**LOL**
If you'd given me my mail last week,
this never would have happened.
# ELAINE
Well, you should have come
to my house to pick it up.
# JERRY
 So am I being funny now?
# ELAINE
 No, actually, you're not.
**LOL**
# JERRY
See, I told you I wasn't funny
all the time.
Hey, George, look,
I'm not funny now.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
No, and you weren't funny last night.
You got us both so depressed...
she asked me to drive
her home after dinner.
# JERRY
I need to get in touch with Cheryl.
Babu needs a lawyer.
His visa's expired.
# GEORGE
There's a million lawyers.
# JERRY
Yeah, but you said this is one
of the things that her firm does.
# GEORGE
All right, but no funny business.
Same deal as last night.
# JERRY
 Will you stop it already.
# GEORGE
 Jerry, please.
# JERRY
How long is this gonna go on?
# GEORGE
Till I'm comfortable.
# JERRY
Well, when is that gonna be?
**LOL**
# GEORGE
After consummation.
# JERRY
Consummation? I don't think
you have enough material.
**LOL**
# CHERYL
I have a friend in the immigration
department who owes me a big favor.
You're very lucky.
**LOL**
# JERRY
That's wonderful news. Thank you.
**LOL**
# CHERYL
You're a very serious person,
aren't you?
# JERRY
Well, with so many people
in the world deprived and unhappy...
it doesn't seem like it would
be fair to be cheerful.
**LOL**
# CHERYL
I understand.
# CHERYL
I think that's curdled.
# JERRY
I don't care.
**LOL**
# CHERYL
Do you ever laugh?
# JERRY
Not really.
Sometimes when I'm in the tub.
**LOL**
# CHERYL
That's so sad.
What do you do?
# JERRY
I'm a comedian.
Oh, let me get that.
You've been so helpful.
# ELAINE
Hey, we're gonna go
see Babu now, right?
# JERRY
Yeah, I'll just pay for this.
# ELAINE
I'm just gonna say hi to Cheryl.
# CHERYL
 Hi.
 Hi.
# ELAINE
Listen, gosh,
I wanted to thank you so much...
for convincing Ping
to drop the case.
# CHERYL
After we met, you were all so nice,
I just couldn't go through with it.
But between you and me, you would
have paid through the nose.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 You're kidding.
# CHERYL
 No, I'm not.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 Babu.
# BABU
 Jerry! Jerry. Hello, Jerry,
# JERRY
 You remember Elaine.
# BABU
 Yes, yes, of course.
# ELAINE
 Nice to meet you.
# BABU
 So nice of you both to come.
# JERRY
 Oh, Babu.
# BABU
 No, you're both very kind. Very kind.
# JERRY& ELAINE
 Oh, well, you know, we try.
# ELAINE
# JERRY
 We do what we can.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 We do what we can.
# BABU
 See...
the problem is, I never got my
visa-renewal form in the mail.
 I was expecting it.
# JERRY
 Yes. See, here's the thing, Babu.
What happened was...
I was away for a couple of weeks
doing some comedy shows.
# BABU
The comedy shows,
you're very funny man.
# JERRY
Well, Elaine, here, was picking up
my mail while I was away...
because that little box
can get very full.
# BABU
Yes, of course.
TV Guide, magazines, everything.
I would have picked up your mail.
 Your box is right next to mine.
# JERRY
 I don't want to bother you.
# BABU
No bother. You get me job. You get
me apartment, you very good man.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Well, yesterday,
after they took you away...
I looked in my mail,
and I noticed that the mailman...
accidentally put your
visa-renewal in my mailbox.
# BABU
Come again?
**LOL**
# JERRY
See, I've been home for a week...
and Elaine didn't give me my mail
till yesterday...
even though
I asked her repeatedly for it.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Yeah, but, Babu, he could have come
to my house to pick it up.
# BABU
You had my visa application?
# JERRY
 Well, not technically.
# BABU
 I kill you!
# JERRY
 What about her?
**LOL**
# BABU
 I kill both of you!
# JERRY
 Babu.
# BABU
 No Babu.
No Babu. You're bad man.
You're very bad man.
You're very lazy, bad man.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Babu, I'm gonna fix everything.
I have a lawyer who knows someone
in the immigration department.
They'll straighten the whole thing out.
The wheels are in motion.
Things are happening
as we speak.
**LOL**
# BABU
 The wheels are in motion?
# JERRY
 The wheels are in motion.
Things are happening.
# GEORGE
Jerry?
# CHERYL
I'm very attracted to him.
# GEORGE
You think the person
you were talking to was him?
That's not even close to him.
He's funny. Jerry's funny.
# CHERYL
 He's never said anything funny.
# GEORGE
 He can't not be funny.
# CHERYL
No, no. He's dark and disturbed.
# GEORGE
Dark and disturbed?
His whole life revolves around
Superman and cereal.
**LOL**
What kind of a friend are you?
I convinced him to act like that so
that you would think I was funnier.
That's how disturbed I am.
You want disturbed?
That's disturbed.
**LOL**
I mean, you can't find sickness
like that anywhere.
You think sickness like that
grows on trees?
Nobody is sicker than me. Nobody.
He's pretending.
I am the genuine article.
# CHERYL
You're telling me Jerry's whole thing
was an act?
**LOL**
# GEORGE
And I put him up to it,
because I'm sick.
I'm the one that needs help.
**LOL**
# CHERYL
I gotta go.
# GEORGE
Well, should I call you later?
# CHERYL
Please don't.
# GEORGE
But... But I'm disturbed.
I'm depressed.
I'm inadequate. I got it all!
**LOL**
# ELAINE
So, what's up with Babu?
How come he's not back?
# JERRY
I don't know. I don't understand it.
Cheryl was supposed to take care
of it. He should be back by now.
 Yeah?
# GEORGE
 George.
# JERRY
 Come on up.
# JERRY
 Babu.
 Babu, what happened to you?
 Babu must be back.
# JERRY
 Well, where's Babu?
 He is in Pakistan!
# JERRY
 Who are you?
**LOL**
 I am his brother.
He knew a lawyer.
It was all going to be fixed.
# JERRY
I'm sure the lawyer
did everything they could.
Then where is Babu?
What happened to Babu?
Show me Babu!
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 Snapple?
 No.
Too fruity.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Hey, what happened?
I thought Cheryl
was gonna help Babu get his visa.
# GEORGE
 She didn't help him?
# JERRY
 No.
# GEORGE
 Where is he?
# JERRY
 He's in Pakistan.
# GEORGE
Oh, boy
# JERRY
What do you mean, "Oh, boy"?
# GEORGE
Well, last night she told me
that she liked you.
Not you, the disturbed you.
**LOL**
So I had to tell her the truth.
# JERRY
You told her the truth?
Well, you got Babu deported!
# GEORGE
What do you mean I "got"? You didn't
give him his visa application.
# JERRY
That's because she had my mail.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Well, I wouldn't have to get your mail
if he didn't go to that fantasy camp.
# KRAMER
Well, I just came back
from Mickey Mantle's restaurant.
# JERRY
How could you go in there?
# KRAMER
Well, I had to. I had to apologize.
I mean, I punched Mickey Mantle,
my idol.
It was eating me up inside!
**LOL**
# JERRY
Well, what happened?
# KRAMER
I got down on my knees, and I went,
"Go ahead, Mickey, hit me.
I'm begging you, Mickey.
Please, hit me. Come on, hit me.
I love you, Mickey. I love you."
**LOL**
# ELAINE
So, what did he do?
# KRAMER
Well, the four of them, they picked
me up by my pants...
and they threw me outside,
right into a horse.
**LOL**
# VOICE
 Kramer.
# KRAMER
 Hey!
Yeah. It's my Chinese food.
# ELAINE
Oh, Ping. Hi.
Listen, thank you so much
for dropping that lawsuit against me.
# PING
 Not anymore.
# ELAINE
 What?
# PING
Cheryl call me last night.
Lawsuit back on.
# ELAINE
Why?
**LOL**
# PING
She call you
and your friends big liars.
You think she nice girl?
Wait till you see her in court.
She's a shark!
**LOL**
They call her "The Terminator."
She never lose a case,
and now you make her mad.
She doubled the damages.
Hasta la vista, baby.
**LOL**
# BABU
So his friend had the mail,
but she did not give it to him.
And then he came to visit me...
said a lawyer would call and help.
He said the wheels were in motion.
**LOL**
But there was no motion.
There was nothing.
And so they sent me back here.
This is a terrible story, Babu.
**LOL**
What are you going to do?
# BABU
I'm going to save up every rupee...
for someday...
I will get back to America,
and when I do...
I will exact vengeance
on this man.
**LOL**
I cannot forget him.
He haunts me.
He's a very bad man.
He's a very, very bad man.
**LOL**
# JERRY
I am for open immigration...
but that sign we have
on the Statue of Liberty:
"Give us your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses."
Can't we just say, "Hey, the door's
open, we'll take whoever you got."
**LOL**
Do we have to specify
the "wretched refuse"?
I mean, why don't we just say:
**LOL**
"Give us the unhappy, the sad,
the slow, the ugly...
people that can't drive,
that they have trouble merging...
if they can't stay in their lane,
don't signal, can't parallel park...
if they're sneezing, if they're
stuffed up, if they're clogged...
if they have bad penmanship, don't
return calls, if they have dandruff...
food between their teeth, if they have
bad credit, if they have no credit...
missed a spot shaving."
In other words...
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
