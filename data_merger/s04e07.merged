# JERRY
Have you ever called someone and were
disappointed when they answered?
You wanted the machine.
You're always thrown off.
You go, "Oh, I... I didn't know
you were there.
I just wanted to leave a message
saying, 'Sorry I missed you. "'
**LOL**
So here's two people who hate each
other, don't really ever wanna talk...
but the phone machine
is like this relationship respirator...
keeping these marginal,
brain-dead relationships alive.
We do it so when we come home,
you can see the little flashing red light.
**LOL**
You go, "All right, messages."
You see, people need that.
It's very important for human beings
to feel popular and well-liked...
amongst a large group of people
we don't care for.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# JERRY
Well, this is it.
# NAOMI
Oh, this is nice.
 Thanks again for the Chinese food.
# JERRY
 Oh, you're welcome.
 I think I ate too much of that garlic.
# NAOMI
 Me too.
# JERRY
I ate the whole plate. I didn't know.
I thought they were peanuts.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# NAOMI
You know what, I think Naked Gun
is on. Oh, I've seen it.
I laughed through that whole thing.
Wanna watch?
# JERRY
No.
 I mean, I don't think so.
# NAOMI
 I thought you liked to laugh.
I thought you were
happy-go-lucky.
# JERRY
No, no. I'm not happy,
I'm not lucky, and I don't go.
**LOL**
If anything, I'm sad-stop-unlucky.
# NAOMI
# JERRY
That's not funny, Naomi.
I didn't mean to be funny there.
**LOL**
# NAOMI
# JERRY
Why don't you check the TV Guide?
I think Holocaust is on.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Jerry, it's George. You all set for the
weekend? This is gonna be great.
You'll have a great time with Naomi.
# GEORGE
All right, she's got that laugh.
What'd you say, it's like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?
**LOL**
# GEORGE
I was thinking we'd take two cars
up to the cabin.
That way, you know, if one of us
wanted to stay...
**LOL**
# JERRY
This thing has never worked right.
**LOL**
# NAOMI
You think I laugh like Elmer Fudd
sitting on a juicer?
# JERRY
Well, first of all, Elmer Fudd
is one of the most beloved...
internationally known
cartoon characters of all time.
"I'm gonna kill that cwazy wabbit."
**LOL**
Come on! Not only that, a juicer
is one of the healthiest ways...
It makes juice, it extracts the pulp
and... And then the vitamins.
**LOL**
For long life and vitality.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# JERRY
How could you leave
a message like that?
# GEORGE
How could you play it to just anyone?
# JERRY
I didn't think you'd leave it.
# GEORGE
 I didn't think you'd play it.
# JERRY
 Now she's not coming this weekend.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
What do you mean, not going?
We got plans. Call her up.
# JERRY
Ah, it's better anyway.
I mean, really.
What was gonna happen?
I'm a comedian. How can I go out
with a girl with a laugh like that?
It's like Coco Chanel going out
with a fishmonger.
**LOL**
You know, she's with all the perfumes,
and a fishmonger's a pretty bad smell.
# GEORGE
Well, maybe you should ask Elaine.
# JERRY
But if I ask Elaine,
Kramer will feel slighted.
# GEORGE
Oh, no, no. Don't say anything
to Kramer. Susan can't stand him.
He vomited all over her.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Wait a minute. Do you smell smoke?
# KRAMER
# JERRY
 Ah, Kramer.
**LOL**
# KRAMER
 Hello, boys.
Top of the morning to you.
What do you say? What do you be?
# JERRY
Put that thing out before you start
another fire.
You had to give him cigars.
# KRAMER
So, what are you guys
doing this weekend?
 Ah, we're...
# KRAMER
 Because I'm gonna be playing golf...
at the Westchester Country Club.
# JERRY
Westchester? Isn't that a private club?
# KRAMER
That's right, buddy.
It's private. It's very private.
**LOL**
I met the pro at the golf shop up on
49th Street. I gave him a Cuban...
and he invites me for a free round.
Then he says, anytime I lay one of
these on him, it'll be the same deal.
 Wow.
 Isn't that beautiful?
# KRAMER
Man, I'm gonna be hitting
the links all weekend.
# GEORGE
 Gee, that's... That's too bad.
# JERRY
 Yeah. Too bad.
# KRAMER
 Why? What? What?
# GEORGE
 Because we were just saying...
we were gonna ask you
to the country.
Susan's father has a cabin up there,
but all right.
# KRAMER
They got any
golf courses up there?
No, no, no.
# GEORGE
 No, no, that's pie country.
# JERRY
 Yeah.
# GEORGE
Yeah, they do a lot of baking up there.
# KRAMER
# JERRY
They sell them by the road.
Blueberry, blackberry.
# GEORGE
 Blackberry, boysenberry.
# JERRY
 Boysenberry, huckleberry.
# GEORGE
# JERRY
 Raspberry, strawberry.
# GEORGE
 Strawberry, cranberry.
# JERRY
Peach.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 I don't know.
# JERRY
 Come on, I don't wanna tag along...
with George and Susan.
With you, it's a better group.
# ELAINE
 What's that?
# JERRY
 Oh, it's an autographed picture...
for my dry cleaner. I never know
what to write on these things.
I hate doing this.
# ELAINE
"I'm very impressed"?
You mean "pressed"
because it's a dry cleaner?
# JERRY
Yeah, see? That's why I hate it.
So come on, you wanna go?
# ELAINE
Well, what about the sleeping
arrangements in the cabin?
# JERRY
Well... Same bed,
and underwear and a T-shirt.
# ELAINE
# JERRY
# ELAINE
 What about me?
# JERRY
 Well, you'd be naked, of course.
# ELAINE
# MEL
 Excuse me. Jerry Seinfeld?
# JERRY
 Yeah.
# MEL
# JERRY
# MEL
My names Sanger, Mel Sanger.
I drive that truck out there.
# JERRY
 The Yoo-hoo?
# MEL
 Yeah.
# JERRY
 I love Yoo-hoo.
**LOL**
# MEL
 Yes, it's a fine product.
I saw you on The Tonight Show
a couple of weeks ago.
I was watching the show
with my son Donald.
He's got this rare immune deficiency
in his blood.
The damnedest thing. Doctors say
he has to live in a plastic bubble.
Can you imagine that? A bubble.
# JERRY
 A bubble?
# ELAINE
 A bubble?
# MEL
Yes, a bubble.
**LOL**
# MEL
 Do you mind? May I?
# ELAINE
 Oh, sure.
# MEL
It'd break your heart
seeing him in there.
He's like a prisoner.
No friends. Just his mother and me.
And I'm out there six days
a week hauling Yoo-hoo.
We have sacrificed everything,
all for the sake of our little...
bubble boy.
# MEL
 Excuse me.
# ELAINE
 Oh, here.
# MEL
Excuse me.
Anyway, we were watching
you on TV...
# JERRY
You get in the bubble with him?
# MEL
No. He can see through the bubble,
it's plastic.
# JERRY
 Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.
# MEL
 No. It's clear.
# JERRY
# ELAINE
Who has the remote?
**LOL**
# MEL
He does.
# ELAINE
The remote goes through the bubble?
# MEL
Yeah. He's in the bubble
with the remote.
# JERRY
So you have no control
over the remote?
# MEL
No. It's frustrating.
# JERRY
# ELAINE
Yeah. Of course. Yeah.
# MEL
So anyway,
you're his favorite comedian.
He laughed so hard the other night...
we had to give him
an extra shot of hemoglobin.
# JERRY
That's nice.
# MEL
Tomorrow is his birthday.
And it would mean so much to him
if you could find it in your heart...
to pay him a visit and just say hello.
# JERRY
 Oh, well, tomorrow, I...
# ELAINE
Jerry. Of course he'd pay him a visit.
You'd be happy to.
# JERRY
Yeah. Okay...
Tomorrow. Where do you live?
Uptown? Up Westside?
# MEL
 No. Upstate.
 Upstate.
**LOL**
# JERRY
# JERRY
He's a bubble boy!
# GEORGE
 A bubble boy?
# JERRY
 Yes, a bubble boy.
# SUSAN
 What's a bubble boy?
# JERRY
 He lives in a bubble.
# GEORGE
Boy.
# SUSAN
What kind of a bubble, like an igloo?
# JERRY
No, that's what I thought. It's
a piece of plastic dividing the room.
# SUSAN
# GEORGE
What kind of plastic do you think it is?
Like that dry-cleaning plastic?
**LOL**
# JERRY
That's no good.
He wouldn't last 10 minutes in there.
**LOL**
What can I do?
I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.
It's his birthday.
I can't go to the cabin.
# SUSAN
 Well, where does he live?
# JERRY
 I don't know. Upstate. Fall-something.
# SUSAN
Wait a minute. This is right
on the way to the cabin.
# GEORGE
Oh, all right. Beautiful. So you stop in,
visit the bubble boy for 20 minutes...
then we can go.
# JERRY
 You think so?
# SUSAN
I know exactly where this is.
You can just follow us.
# JERRY
Oh, great. Okay, we're going away.
 I think I'm excited.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
# SUSAN
 I'm excited.
Oh, you're gonna love this cabin.
My grandfather built it in 1947.
 It's incredible.
# JERRY
# GEORGE
 There you go. It's a '47 cabin.
 So we'll see you tomorrow.
**LOL**
 Okay.
# JERRY
# KRAMER
Well, hey.
Very nice. Very nice.
# KRAMER
 Well, I'm off to the links.
 Yeah.
# KRAMER
I wanna thank you
for the invite upstate.
I'm sorry I can't make it.
# SUSAN
 The what?
# GEORGE
 Nothing. Let's get going. Come on.
# SUSAN
 Did you..?
# GEORGE
 No, no, we'll talk about it later.
# SUSAN
Is that one of the cigars
my father gave you?
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Hey, what's with George and Susan?
Does he actually like her?
# JERRY
I don't know if he likes her
as much as he likes it.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Oh, that's nice.
# JERRY
What's he doing? What is his hurry?
# ELAINE
Oh, you know George.
He's gotta make "good time."
# JERRY
He once went from West 81 st St.
To Kennedy airport in 25 minutes.
I never heard the end of it.
# ELAINE
# JERRY
Look at him.
# ELAINE
# GEORGE
Would you stop that, please?
Just stop that.
# SUSAN
 Why?
# GEORGE
 Knock it off. You're distracting me.
We're making incredible time here.
**LOL**
I once made it to Kennedy airport
from West 81 St. in 15 minutes.
**LOL**
Oh, here. Hold this.
It's $10 for the tolls.
# JERRY
What's he doing?
Is he out of his mind?
**LOL**
Do you see him? I don't even
see him anymore. Where is he?
# ELAINE
 Isn't that blue car him?
# JERRY
 No, no, that's not him.
What happened to him?
I can't believe it. I lost him.
That stupid idiot.
 Now what are we gonna do?
# ELAINE
 It's no big deal, Jerry.
We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.
# JERRY
I don't even know
where the bubble boy lives.
**LOL**
I don't even remember the name
of the town.
# ELAINE
 You don't have the directions?
# JERRY
 No, I was following him!
# ELAINE
How could you not take the directions?
# JERRY
Because he's my directions.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# SUSAN
I don't see them, George.
# JERRY
You make plans,
then he goes 100 miles an hour...
**LOL**
the weekend's over just like that.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Poor little bubble boy.
He's sitting there waiting for you
in his bubble or igloo thing, whatever.
# ELAINE
I don't know what to do.
I don't know where I am.
**LOL**
Just get off at this exit.
We'll figure something out.
# SUSAN
We lost them. Do you know that?
We lost them.
# GEORGE
Well, it's not my fault.
Seinfeld can't drive.
How hard is it to follow somebody?
# SUSAN
Well, now what are you gonna do?
# GEORGE
It's fine. We'll just meet him
at the bubble boy's house.
# SUSAN
Does he have the address?
**LOL**
# JERRY
Yeah.
**LOL**
Leave a message,
I'll call you back. Thanks.
# NAOMI
Hi, Jerry. It's Naomi.
Listen, if it's not too late,
I changed my mind.
 I'd like to go to the cabin.
# KRAMER
 Wait. Wait.
**LOL**
Yeah, hello. Hi.
This is Kramer.
Yeah. I'm the next-door neighbor.
You know, Jerry's left, but listen,
you see, my golf game got canceled.
I'm thinking of going up myself.
They got pies,
and I got the directions right here.
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
# KRAMER
I drive all the way
to the country club...
and then I find out
there's a tournament going on.
 You mind if I smoke?
# NAOMI
 No.
# KRAMER
These are Cubans.
**LOL**
# NAOMI
# GEORGE
I don't know if this is the house.
I don't see Jerry's car anywhere.
# GEORGE
Would you stop it?
Would you quit it, please?
Someone is gonna see us here.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
So what?
You are such a prude.
# GEORGE
Hey. I am not a prude, sweetheart.
I swing with the best of them.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 Come on, let's go in.
# GEORGE
 What?
# SUSAN
We should tell them what happened.
They might be very late...
if they make it all.
# GEORGE
 I can't go in there.
I can't face the bubble boy.
# SUSAN
 What's the matter?
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 I don't react well to these situations.
My grandmother died two months early
from how I reacted in the hospital.
She was getting better.
Then I paid her a visit.
She saw my face, boom.
That was the end of her.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 We're going in.
# GEORGE
 Wait, please...
# SUSAN
 Come on, George. George, stop.
# GEORGE
 Would you wait one moment...
**LOL**
# JERRY
I can't believe a little thing
like George speeding...
and my whole weekend is gone.
The plans, the packing. Everything.
# ELAINE
Your whole weekend?
What about the bubble boy?
# JERRY
Why do you keep bringing up
the bubble boy?
You don't have to mention him.
I know about the bubble boy.
I'm aware of the bubble boy.
Why do you keep reminding me
about the bubble boy?
**LOL**
# JERRY
I'll have a cup of coffee
and a turkey club.
# WAITRESS
 How about you?
# ELAINE
 I'll just have a glass of water.
# JERRY
You can't just have water.
# ELAINE
Why not? That's all I want.
# JERRY
This isn't a park bench
where you come in and sit down.
It's a business.
**LOL**
# WAITRESS
Hold it a second.
Don't you play on TV?
# JERRY
 Oh, no.
# ELAINE
 Yes. Yes, you saw him on TV.
**LOL**
# WAITRESS
 What's your name?
# ELAINE
 Jerry Seinfeld.
# JERRY
# WAITRESS
 Elaine...
 Gary Seinfield.
 I saw you on The Tonight Show.
# ELAINE
 Right.
Wouldn't you like
an autographed picture?
# WAITRESS
# JERRY
I don't have any more pictures, Elaine.
# ELAINE
He's lying. They're in the trunk.
 Now you get to sign another one.
# JERRY
 I'm not lying.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Yeah. Yeah, he is.
# JERRY
She'll have a cup of coffee
and a broiled chicken.
**LOL**
# MRS. SANGER
See, it's not really a bubble.
A lot of people think it's an igloo,
but it's really just a plastic divider.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
# GEORGE
Can you go in the bubble?
**LOL**
# MRS. SANGER
Well, you have to put so many things
on because of the germs.
# MEL
The gloves, the mask,
it's a whole production.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
So then he makes his own bed?
# MRS. SANGER
Well, that's one of the things
we fight about.
**LOL**
# MEL
Would you like to meet him?
# GEORGE
 Ah, well, you know...
# MRS. SANGER
 Oh, he loves games.
Maybe you could play Trivial Pursuit
with him.
# DONALD
Hey, Ma! What the hell do I gotta
do to get some food around here?
**LOL**
I'm starving. And if it's peanut butter,
I'm gonna shove it in your face!
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
# MRS. SANGER
# ELAINE
 One picture left in the trunk.
# JERRY
 Thanks. This is fun.
Yeah, this turned out to be
a great weekend.
# ELAINE
Where's my water?
# JERRY
Oh, it's coming.
**LOL**
 Here you go.
# WAITRESS
 Thanks.
# ELAINE
What'd you write?
# WAITRESS
"Nothing's finer
than being in your diner."
**LOL**
# ELAINE
There is "nothing finer than being
in your diner"?
# JERRY
 No good?
# ELAINE
 This is what you came up with?
**LOL**
# JERRY
Well?
# ELAINE
That is so lame, Jerry.
People will be reading that for the
next 20 years and laughing at you.
# JERRY
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Would you mind?
I'd like the picture back.
# WAITRESS
 Why?
# JERRY
 I'm not happy with what I wrote.
# WAITRESS
 It's good. I like it.
# JERRY
 No, believe me, it's not good.
I'll mail you one with something
really funny.
# WAITRESS
Well, when you mail me a new one,
I'll send you back this one.
# JERRY
You don't understand.
I want the picture.
Right.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# MRS. SANGER
This is Donald.
# GEORGE
 Hi.
# SUSAN
 Hello.
# DONALD
Who are you?
 Where's Seinfeld?
# MRS. SANGER
 He's on his way.
These are his friends.
# DONALD
What are you looking at?
Never seen a kid in a bubble before?
# GEORGE
Of course I have. Come on.
My cousin's in a bubble.
**LOL**
My friend Jeffrey's sister also,
bubble, you know...
**LOL**
I got a lot of bubble experience.
Come on.
# DONALD
 What's your story?
# SUSAN
 I have no story.
# GEORGE
She works for NBC.
# DONALD
How about taking your top off?
**LOL**
# MRS. SANGER
Donald, behave yourself.
# DONALD
Come on.
# MRS. SANGER
I know, I know.
Why don't you play
a game of Trivial Pursuit?
# GEORGE
Ah, you know, we gotta be running...
# DONALD
What, are you afraid?
# GEORGE
 No. You see, it's...
# DONALD
 I'm gonna kick your ass.
**LOL**
# JERRY
I was nice enough
to give you the picture.
I don't like what I wrote. I don't want
it up there. Please just give it back.
# WAITRESS
You are really starting
to get under my skin.
# JERRY
 I want that picture.
# WAITRESS
 Well, you can't have it.
In fact, maybe you better
just pay your check, and get out.
# JERRY
I'm not paying until I get that back.
# WAITRESS
Well, you ain't getting it back.
# JERRY
Well, maybe I'll just take it back.
# ELAINE
This chicken is really good.
**LOL**
# DONALD
Okay, history.
This is for the game.
How you doing over there?
Not too good.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
All right, bubble boy.
**LOL**
Let's just play.
"Who invaded Spain
in the eighth century?"
# DONALD
That's a joke. The Moors.
# GEORGE
Oh, no.
I'm so sorry. It's the "Moops."
The correct answer is the Moops.
**LOL**
# DONALD
Moops? Let me see that.
That's not Moops, you jerk.
It's Moors. It's a misprint.
# GEORGE
I'm sorry. The card says Moops.
**LOL**
# DONALD
It doesn't matter. It's Moors.
There's no Moops.
# GEORGE
 It's Moops.
# DONALD
 Moors.
# GEORGE
 Moops.
# DONALD
 Moors!
# KRAMER
Hey!
Anybody home?
 Oh, boy.
# NAOMI
 What should we do?
# KRAMER
Hold these pies.
**LOL**
# KRAMER
Okay.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Help. Someone...
# DONALD
 There's no Moops, you idiot!
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 Stop it! Let go of him.
# MRS. SANGER
Donald. Stop it.
Now, let go of him, Donald.
# DONALD
 I'm gonna kill him.
# GEORGE
 He's choking me.
# MRS. SANGER
 Donald. Stop.
# DONALD
 Moors!
Say Moors!
# GEORGE
Moops. Moops.
# MRS. SANGER
Donald, stop it.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# JERRY
What are you doing?
You're choking me. Elaine!
# WAITRESS
 Are you gonna pay today?
# JERRY
 No, I want that picture back!
**LOL**
# MAN #1
Something's happened
to the bubble boy!
 They're rushing him to hospital.
# WAITRESS
 What?
# JERRY
The bubble boy?
He lives around here?
# MAN #1
That's his house, down the road.
# MAN #2
He got in a fight with some guy.
# GUY #1 
Who kind of a person would hurt
the bubble boy?
**LOL**
# MAN #2
Some little bald guy from the city.
**LOL**
# MAN #1
Come on, Vern. Page, Preston, don't
you think we ought to do something?
# KRAMER
Naomi, come on, let's get going.
# NAOMI
But that lake must be freezing.
# KRAMER
No, it's good for you.
Retards the aging process.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# NAOMI
Ready to go swimming?
# KRAMER
Let's go.
Okay.
**LOL**
# NAOMI
# KRAMER
# GEORGE
Jerry, what happened to you?
# JERRY
What happened to you?
You were going 100 miles an hour.
# GEORGE
I was not.
Bubble boy tried to kill me.
# ELAINE
 What?
# GEORGE
 Susan, tell them.
# SUSAN
It's a long story.
# GEORGE
# DONALD
 Hey, Seinfeld.
# JERRY
 Hey, happy birthday.
# ELAINE
# DONALD
Thanks for showing up.
 You know, your friend tried to kill me.
# GEORGE
 He's a lying snot.
**LOL**
He's a cheater, aren't you,
little twerp?
**LOL**
# DONALD
# GEORGE
# DONALD
 Moors!
# GEORGE
 Moops!
# DONALD
 Moors!
# GEORGE
 Moops!
**LOL**
# MAN #1
There's the guy who tried to kill
the bubble boy. Get him!
**LOL**
# GEORGE
# JERRY
Fire engines.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Must be a big one.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Do you smell something?
# JERRY
 Yeah.
# SUSAN
 Smoke.
# GEORGE
Yeah. Definite smoke.
# ELAINE
Look, it's a fire!
# JERRY
Holy cow, look at that!
# ELAINE
 It's my father's cabin!
 The cabin is on fire.
# GEORGE
I just realized, you never gave
me back the change from the tolls.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
How could this have happened?
**LOL**
# KRAMER
# NAOMI
Oh, my God. The cabin.
# JERRY
What are you two doing here?
# NAOMI
Look at that.
# JERRY
Hey, you didn't:
# KRAMER
My Cubans.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Something very scary
and exciting about fire.
People always run to see a fire.
They're very proud
if they have a fireplace.
I think that's what smoking
is really all about.
That's the power of smoking.
It's just this thing:
"I got fire right here in my hand.
**LOL**
Smoke and fire is literally
coming right out of my mouth."
And it's very intimidating
to the nonsmoker.
It's like talking to someone going:
"My head could open up.
Lava could explode out.
Pour right down my face.
Doesn't bother me a bit."
**LOL**
And a cigar is even worse.
I mean, a cigar is like:
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
