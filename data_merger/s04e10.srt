1
00:00:00,759 --> 00:00:03,446
There's no easy way to break
off any relationship.

2
00:00:03,478 --> 00:00:06,473
I think when you first start dating,
they ought to give you three...

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,445
"Get out of Relationship Free"
cards.

4
00:00:08,517 --> 00:00:11,381
You know what I mean? So you
could just go up to the person...

5
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:13,145
and go, "Here you go. I'm sorry.

6
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:15,847
I'll grab the tennis racket.
Don't even bother to get up.

7
00:00:15,924 --> 00:00:18,015
Have a good one. Sorry."

8
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:21,162
Which is fine, unless the person
you're in the relationship with...

9
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:24,731
has a "Eight More Months of Guilt,
Torture and Pain" card.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,361
"Hold it. I got a little something
for you."

11
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:34,673
- We're dead.
- We're not dead.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:36,276
- We are dead.
- Come on.

13
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:38,379
We got all day tomorrow
to think of a story.

14
00:00:38,447 --> 00:00:41,277
All day tomorrow? We had a month
to come up with something.

15
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,077
We didn't do anything.

16
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,217
So we'll do it tomorrow.

17
00:00:45,387 --> 00:00:47,819
Let me ask you: when's the last time
you went skiing?

18
00:00:48,157 --> 00:00:49,485
About six years ago.

19
00:00:50,058 --> 00:00:53,389
I think you can take the lift ticket
off your jacket now.

20
00:00:53,896 --> 00:00:56,123
Women like skiers.

21
00:00:56,198 --> 00:00:58,823
So what? You can't meet anybody.
You're with Susan.

22
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,903
Yeah. Right.

23
00:01:02,838 --> 00:01:04,462
See those two women over there?

24
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,734
I almost dated the one on the right.
She's in the closet business.

25
00:01:07,809 --> 00:01:09,774
Closet business?

26
00:01:09,845 --> 00:01:12,675
- What's the closet business?
- What is it your business?

27
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:16,516
- I'm interested.
- She reorganizes your closet...

28
00:01:16,585 --> 00:01:19,745
and shows you how to maximize
your closet space.

29
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,149
She looked into my closet.

30
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,252
You thought she was good-looking.
This was a way to meet her.

31
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:27,360
- Yeah.
- Yeah. So, what happened?

32
00:01:27,429 --> 00:01:29,724
She mentioned she had
a boyfriend. Then it hit me:

33
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,389
What do I need
more closet space for?

34
00:01:33,602 --> 00:01:36,432
- Hi, Marla.
- Jerry.

35
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:37,833
- George, Marla.
- Marla.

36
00:01:37,906 --> 00:01:39,667
George. Jerry, Stacy.

37
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:41,365
- Stacy. George, Stacy.
- Jerry.

38
00:01:41,443 --> 00:01:43,101
- Stacy.
- George.

39
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,410
George.

40
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:50,551
Jerry, Marla. Stacy.

41
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:57,684
- So, how was your trip to Berlin?
- Trip to Berlin?

42
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,952
Remember, that's why you
put off the closets.

43
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,652
You said you were going to Berlin.

44
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,764
Oh, right, right.

45
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,594
The Wall had just come down.
You told me you wanted to be...

46
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,996
part of the celebration.

47
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,435
Yes, yes, I did, but you know,
I was watching it on CNN...

48
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:16,202
and they covered it so well, I thought,
why knock my brains out?

49
00:02:16,278 --> 00:02:17,902
You know, my boyfriend went.

50
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,344
- Really?
- Yes, I told him all about you going...

51
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:22,745
and he got all excited
and decided to go.

52
00:02:22,818 --> 00:02:25,648
- Oh, did he like it?
- I don't know. He never came back.

53
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:29,090
Anyway, we met with NBC
about a month ago, and they...

54
00:02:29,157 --> 00:02:31,782
gave us the green light
to go ahead and write a pilot.

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,689
We got a big meeting
with them tomorrow.

56
00:02:33,762 --> 00:02:36,160
They gotta approve the story
before we can write it.

57
00:02:36,465 --> 00:02:41,332
Wow. What a great job. A writer.

58
00:02:41,403 --> 00:02:44,199
Not a bad way to earn a buck.

59
00:02:44,273 --> 00:02:45,704
Sounds great.

60
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,842
Well, I'll tell you, Stacy...

61
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,477
it's a lot of hard work.

62
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,170
But it comes fairly easy to me.

63
00:02:53,915 --> 00:02:57,280
Some people write symphonies.
This is my gift.

64
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,860
- So you gonna go out with her?
- I might.

65
00:03:06,194 --> 00:03:08,888
- What about Susan?
- What? I'm not married.

66
00:03:08,964 --> 00:03:11,225
I'm not allowed to go out
with somebody else?

67
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,833
- Depends.
- Depends on what?

68
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:15,094
- On many factors.
- Like what?

69
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:18,398
Well, how long
you've been seeing her.

70
00:03:18,473 --> 00:03:21,133
What's your phone-call frequency?
Are you on a daily?

71
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:24,278
No. Semi-daily. Four,
five times a week.

72
00:03:24,346 --> 00:03:27,210
Saturday nights, do you ask her out,
or is the date implied?

73
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,840
- Implied.
- She got anything...

74
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,246
in your medicine cabinet?

75
00:03:31,787 --> 00:03:34,287
Might be some moisturizer.

76
00:03:35,857 --> 00:03:37,891
Let me ask you this:

77
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,823
Is there any Tampax in your house?

78
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,799
Yeah.

79
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:50,332
- I'll tell you what you got here.
- Yeah?

80
00:03:50,405 --> 00:03:51,733
You got a girlfriend.

81
00:03:51,807 --> 00:03:54,967
Oh, no, no. What..?
Are you sure, a girlfriend?

82
00:03:55,043 --> 00:03:58,135
I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily,
with Tampax in his house...

83
00:03:58,213 --> 00:04:00,713
and an implied date
on Saturday night.

84
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:04,340
- I would like to help you out, but...
- Do you believe my luck?

85
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,578
The first time I have a good answer to...

86
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:08,746
"What do you do?"
and I have a girlfriend.

87
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:11,589
You don't need a girlfriend
when you can answer that.

88
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,887
That's what you say
in order to get girlfriends.

89
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:18,089
Once you can get girlfriends,
you just want more girlfriends.

90
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,360
You're gonna make
a very good father someday.

91
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,201
Well, it's not fair, Jerry.
It's just not fair.

92
00:04:24,272 --> 00:04:26,237
That's it. I'm getting out
of this thing.

93
00:04:26,408 --> 00:04:28,703
Break up with her.
But you know what this means.

94
00:04:28,777 --> 00:04:31,004
- No, what?
- The script, the pilot, the TV show.

95
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,806
- That's all over.
- What do you mean?

96
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,972
Figure it out. She's one
of the executives...

97
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:38,176
that's gonna make the decision
whether or not they pick up the show.

98
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:39,718
She's one of our biggest fans.

99
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:42,480
You drop her, you think
they're gonna pick us up?

100
00:04:42,557 --> 00:04:46,184
Oh, right. Oh, no! Man.

101
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:48,796
You know, it's a very
interesting situation.

102
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:51,660
Here you have a job that could
help you get girls.

103
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,698
But you also have a relationship.

104
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,667
But if you get rid of the
relationship so you can get girls...

105
00:04:56,738 --> 00:04:58,703
you lose the job.

106
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,800
- You see the irony?
- Yeah, yeah. I see the...

107
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,409
All right, what about this?

108
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,912
What if I could find some way
to break up with her...

109
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:10,916
so that she'll still like me,
and it doesn't affect the deal?

110
00:05:10,986 --> 00:05:12,713
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait. Hear me out.

111
00:05:12,788 --> 00:05:15,413
Hear me out. Don't dismiss this.
You're quick to dismiss.

112
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,319
Don't dismiss.

113
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,824
She's got a big crush on
David Letterman. I mean, a big crush.

114
00:05:21,897 --> 00:05:23,487
She talks about him all the time.

115
00:05:24,065 --> 00:05:26,759
Suppose I go up to
David Letterman.

116
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:30,632
He works at NBC. I work at NBC.

117
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,238
I explain my situation.

118
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:35,467
He agrees to meet her. They go out.
They fall madly in love...

119
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:38,545
and she dumps me
for David Letterman.

120
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,577
- This is your plan?
- No, no, I'm just thinking.

121
00:05:42,651 --> 00:05:44,946
I don't think you are.

122
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,018
Well, let me tell you what I see.

123
00:05:54,162 --> 00:05:57,026
Please. And be brutal.
I have no closet sensitivity.

124
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:02,298
- Are you very fussy about your pants?
- I don't think I am.

125
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,028
Because I have a very radical idea.

126
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:05,900
- Can you handle it?
- Try me.

127
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:09,400
Here's what I'm proposing.
We'll eliminate all this.

128
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,538
The hangers, the bar, the shelves, and
in its place, install a series of hooks.

129
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,783
We'll put everything on hooks.

130
00:06:16,852 --> 00:06:18,613
- Everything?
- Everything.

131
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:21,881
The shirts, pants,
sports jackets, pajamas.

132
00:06:21,957 --> 00:06:24,548
We can get 80 hooks on here.

133
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,724
You're quite mad, you know.

134
00:06:30,298 --> 00:06:32,730
Oh, I don't believe this.

135
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:34,963
Hey. Well, what are you doing?

136
00:06:35,036 --> 00:06:36,865
I'm watching
The Bold and the Beautiful.

137
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,596
- No.
- Wait, wait.

138
00:06:38,673 --> 00:06:40,502
- This is not a good time.
- Five minutes.

139
00:06:40,575 --> 00:06:42,506
What did you give your TV
to George for?

140
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:46,135
Because I've been watching too much.
It was an addiction. I couldn't stop.

141
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:48,111
It was destroying my brain cells.

142
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:51,315
Yeah, but now you're in here
all the time.

143
00:06:51,386 --> 00:06:52,748
Well... Whoa.

144
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:54,320
- Marla, Kramer.
- Hello.

145
00:06:56,992 --> 00:07:00,084
- Go out. It's nice out.
- There's nothing out there for me.

146
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:02,161
- There's weather.
- I don't need weather.

147
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,627
Weather doesn't do it for me.

148
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,732
I'm telling George to give you
your TV back.

149
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,528
No, no. I don't want it back.

150
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:10,762
Are you gonna watch
the Knick game tonight?

151
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,930
- I don't know.
- Will you tape it?

152
00:07:13,008 --> 00:07:16,373
- Kramer.
- Oh, yeah.

153
00:07:23,552 --> 00:07:26,143
So your boyfriend never
came back from Berlin.

154
00:07:26,221 --> 00:07:28,846
- Never came back.
- Oh, you must have been devastated...

155
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:30,355
being left for a wall.

156
00:07:30,425 --> 00:07:31,822
Well...

157
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,125
it was about to end anyway.

158
00:07:34,195 --> 00:07:36,923
There was this problem.

159
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:39,157
Excuse me one second.

160
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:40,562
- Yeah.
- It's me.

161
00:07:40,635 --> 00:07:42,566
Come on up.

162
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:45,005
That's Elaine. She's just
a friend of mine.

163
00:07:45,073 --> 00:07:46,970
I don't know what
she's doing here now.

164
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:49,042
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,838
- What?
- I didn't get it.

166
00:07:55,717 --> 00:07:57,682
So you were saying
there was this problem.

167
00:07:57,752 --> 00:08:00,412
Well, he wanted me
to move in with him.

168
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,613
- Snapple?
- No, thanks.

169
00:08:03,758 --> 00:08:07,316
- Go on.
- Well, I wouldn't move in, because...

170
00:08:07,395 --> 00:08:09,486
- Yes?
- Well, because...

171
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:13,122
- Yeah?
- Well, because I'm a...

172
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,734
virgin.

173
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,662
Hello.

174
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,606
Hi. Marla, Elaine.

175
00:08:20,675 --> 00:08:22,436
Sorry, I didn't know
you had company.

176
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:25,704
- I wanted to return your tape.
- Oh, thanks a lot. Two weeks late.

177
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,680
Now it cost me $35 to see Havana.

178
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,679
I'm sorry. I really am.
I just kept forgetting.

179
00:08:34,756 --> 00:08:36,847
- I should be going.
- No, no, no. I'm leaving.

180
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:38,583
I like that thing in your hair.

181
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,352
Yeah? This woman
was selling them...

182
00:08:40,428 --> 00:08:42,723
at this crazy party
I was at last night.

183
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:44,892
You'll appreciate this. Snapple?

184
00:08:44,966 --> 00:08:46,863
No, thanks.

185
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:50,863
I was talking to this guy,
and I just happened to throw...

186
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,336
my purse on the sofa.

187
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:56,136
And my diaphragm goes flying out.

188
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,977
So I just froze, you know:

189
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,778
Staring at my diaphragm, you know?
It's just lying there.

190
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:06,944
So this woman who sold me
this hair thing...

191
00:09:07,022 --> 00:09:09,750
she grabbed it before
the guy noticed, so I mean...

192
00:09:09,824 --> 00:09:12,154
big deal, right?

193
00:09:12,227 --> 00:09:15,023
So I carry around my diaphragm.
Who doesn't?

194
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,187
I mean, like, it's a big, big secret...

195
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,390
that women carry around
their diaphragms.

196
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:22,732
You never know when
you're gonna need it.

197
00:09:29,544 --> 00:09:31,407
I should be going.

198
00:09:31,479 --> 00:09:35,515
- So we'll talk about the hooks then.
- Yes.

199
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:41,587
- What, was it something I said?
- She's a virgin. She just told me.

200
00:09:41,656 --> 00:09:45,419
- Well, I didn't know.
- Well, it's not like spotting a toupee.

201
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:51,593
Well, you think I should
say something?

202
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:53,358
Should I say something, apologize?

203
00:09:53,435 --> 00:09:55,696
- Was I being anti-virgin?
- No, no.

204
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,065
- I mean...
- Because I'm not anti-virgin.

205
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,902
- I'm gonna... I'll be right back.
- Don't... Elaine. Elaine.

206
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,237
- Yeah?
- It's George.

207
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,246
- She's a virgin?
- A virgin.

208
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,479
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

209
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:14,986
I'm very attracted to her.
That accent is so sexy.

210
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:17,488
I don't think I could do it.

211
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:20,457
They always remember
the first time.

212
00:10:20,528 --> 00:10:23,290
I don't wanna be remembered.
I wanna be forgotten.

213
00:10:23,865 --> 00:10:26,763
You need a little pioneer spirit.
You don't have any of that...

214
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,800
Lewis and Clark in you.

215
00:10:29,571 --> 00:10:32,731
You know, sometimes those guys
don't make it back.

216
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:37,702
- I'm really hungry.
- Yeah, me too.

217
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,040
We gotta get something.
I don't wanna go...

218
00:10:40,115 --> 00:10:42,046
on an empty stomach.
Let's get Chinese.

219
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:44,913
- Wanna order?
- All right, then we gotta get work done.

220
00:10:44,986 --> 00:10:48,078
Let me just call Kramer.
See if he wants anything.

221
00:10:49,057 --> 00:10:50,920
Hey. We're ordering Chinese food.

222
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,889
If you want anything,
let me know what...

223
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:56,224
and I'll order it...

224
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:58,490
for you.

225
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,691
- I'm in. Let's go for it.
- All right. What do you want?

226
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:03,334
- I don't care.
- All right.

227
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:05,495
Why don't we get a couple of
dishes and share.

228
00:11:05,573 --> 00:11:07,163
- All right.
- What are you getting?

229
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,875
- I think I'm gonna get a chow fun.
- What's a chow fun?

230
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:11,841
It's a broad noodle.

231
00:11:11,913 --> 00:11:15,176
- What do you mean "a broad noodle"?
- It's a big, flat noodle.

232
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,883
Well, I don't want a big, flat noodle.

233
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:21,712
- What kind of noodle do you want?
- Who says I want a noodle?

234
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,257
I'm getting the chow fun.
You don't have to have any.

235
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:28,122
I'll get the pea pods, and you can't
have any of my pea pods.

236
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:31,588
- Fine.
- And get extra MSG.

237
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:40,200
Look, Marla, this whole sex thing
is totally overrated.

238
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:43,005
Now, the one thing
you've gotta be ready for...

239
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:47,546
is how the man changes into
a completely different person...

240
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:49,205
five seconds after it's over.

241
00:11:50,185 --> 00:11:52,344
I mean, something happens
to their personality.

242
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,647
It's really quite astounding. It's like...

243
00:11:54,722 --> 00:11:58,383
they committed a crime and wanna
flee the scene before police get there.

244
00:11:59,828 --> 00:12:02,419
- So they just leave?
- Yeah. Pretty much, yeah.

245
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:07,227
Well, the smart ones start working
on their getaway stories during dinner.

246
00:12:07,302 --> 00:12:09,996
How, you know, they gotta
get up early tomorrow.

247
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:12,036
It's always about being up early.

248
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:14,071
They all turn into farmers suddenly.

249
00:12:15,343 --> 00:12:17,809
It must be really good
to put up with all that.

250
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:24,577
Let's go. We don't have time
before the meeting.

251
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:26,185
The food. What happened to Ping?

252
00:12:26,254 --> 00:12:28,822
Don't worry, he'll be here.
Look, we only got two hours.

253
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,551
We need to come up with one good
idea, we can get through this meeting.

254
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:34,986
There's your food.

255
00:12:35,063 --> 00:12:36,755
Hey, what about this?

256
00:12:36,831 --> 00:12:40,025
I'm in a car accident.
The motorist is uninsured.

257
00:12:40,101 --> 00:12:41,930
- You with me?
- Yeah.

258
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,899
My car's totaled.

259
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,336
It's all his fault. Now, he has
absolutely no money.

260
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:48,805
There is no way
that he could pay me.

261
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:51,207
So the judge decrees...

262
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,971
that he becomes my butler.

263
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,174
- Your butler?
- Right.

264
00:12:56,251 --> 00:12:59,377
He cooks my food, cleans my house,
does my shopping, there you go.

265
00:12:59,454 --> 00:13:01,146
That's your program.

266
00:13:01,756 --> 00:13:03,118
- What about me?
- Don't worry.

267
00:13:03,191 --> 00:13:05,316
We find something for you.

268
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:10,095
That's the stupidest idea
I ever heard.

269
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:13,324
Sentenced to be a butler.

270
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,699
- Ping, what happened?
- There was an accident.

271
00:13:16,771 --> 00:13:18,634
Head hurts.

272
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:22,537
- Head really hurts.
- What happened?

273
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,912
Marla and I went out for coffee,
and I was crossing the street...

274
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,049
and he was biking towards me,
so I got out of the way in time...

275
00:13:29,117 --> 00:13:31,344
but he ran into a parked car,
hit his head...

276
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,850
and everything went flying.

277
00:13:32,921 --> 00:13:35,148
Something happened to the food?

278
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:37,122
Could only save one bag.

279
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,350
Should I call an ambulance?
Wanna see a doctor?

280
00:13:39,427 --> 00:13:41,290
I'll get some ice.

281
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:44,192
The pea pods? All you saved
was the pea pods?

282
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,224
- Hey, you got the food?
- Yeah, here.

283
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:48,301
Man, what took you so long?
Hey, Ping.

284
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:50,562
- Kramer.
- Yeah.

285
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:53,500
- Where's yours?
- He dropped it.

286
00:13:53,574 --> 00:13:56,575
Oh, that's too bad.

287
00:13:56,644 --> 00:13:59,713
You should slow down, you know.
It's dangerous to go that fast.

288
00:13:59,781 --> 00:14:02,076
No, no, I have green light.
You jaywalk.

289
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,184
- Are you watching Oprah?
- I did not jaywalk.

290
00:14:04,252 --> 00:14:05,717
You're giving him back that TV.

291
00:14:05,787 --> 00:14:07,616
- Yes, you jaywalk.
- No, I don't want it.

292
00:14:07,689 --> 00:14:09,723
Jaywalker. I can slap a suit on you.

293
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,119
- What?
- We've got work to do.

294
00:14:11,192 --> 00:14:13,760
- What about the meeting?
- An hour with Patrick Swayze.

295
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,425
A month and a half we had.
We did nothing.

296
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:24,162
We put it off until today.
Then we couldn't do anything...

297
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,533
because Elaine runs
to apologize to a virgin...

298
00:14:26,607 --> 00:14:30,143
crosses against the light and
knocks over a Chinese delivery boy.

299
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:33,109
And now we're gonna go make
fools of ourselves. We got nothing.

300
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:36,842
You're not even in show business.
I got a reputation.

301
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:39,543
You're dragging me into
the sewer with you.

302
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,915
I've been on TV, buddy boy.

303
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,288
You know how fast word spreads
in show business? Just like that:

304
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:49,589
One bad impression,
you're out of the business!

305
00:14:49,697 --> 00:14:51,765
Let's postpone it.
Let's get out of here.

306
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,264
What? They know we're here.

307
00:14:53,334 --> 00:14:57,097
I'll fake an illness. My back!
My back! I can't move my back!

308
00:14:57,171 --> 00:14:58,636
No, no. Would you get up?

309
00:14:58,706 --> 00:15:01,138
- I could do this, Jerry.
- No.

310
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,800
All right, I'll tell them
that my sister died.

311
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:06,105
My poor sister died.

312
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,078
She was standing on the street,
and then she was laughing...

313
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,684
and then they shot her!

314
00:15:11,753 --> 00:15:13,980
That's the kind of a sick city
we're living in!

315
00:15:14,055 --> 00:15:15,986
They shoot you for laughing!

316
00:15:16,057 --> 00:15:18,819
I must go and comfort my poor family.
Jerry, come on.

317
00:15:18,893 --> 00:15:22,429
Take me home so I can comfort my...
My poor family.

318
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,557
- What?
- That's David Letterman.

319
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,529
I just saw David Letterman walk by.

320
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,661
Be right back.

321
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:31,566
Mr. Seinfeld, they're ready
for you now.

322
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,439
Yes, I was very wise
to hitch my wagon to his star.

323
00:15:44,085 --> 00:15:45,618
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hi.

324
00:15:45,686 --> 00:15:47,310
How you doing?
Nice to see you all.

325
00:15:47,388 --> 00:15:50,582
- Hello, Jerry. I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

326
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,158
- Where's Russell?
- He had to go to L.A.

327
00:15:53,227 --> 00:15:55,056
There's a problem on the set
at Blossom.

328
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:59,230
Oh, poor Blossom.

329
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Anyway, he asked me
to sit in for him.

330
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:03,058
Where's George?

331
00:16:03,137 --> 00:16:05,137
He ran to say something
to David Letterman.

332
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:08,069
- David Letterman's on the floor?
- Yeah, he just walked by.

333
00:16:10,044 --> 00:16:13,011
I think we should
get started, anyway.

334
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,249
Yeah. Good idea.

335
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,643
- So how are you guys coming along?
- Good. Good.

336
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:20,048
We've got a number of ideas.

337
00:16:20,121 --> 00:16:21,586
Good.

338
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:26,054
Have you been to
a Chinese restaurant...

339
00:16:26,127 --> 00:16:28,991
and they say five minutes
for a table, and you wind up...

340
00:16:29,063 --> 00:16:30,596
waiting there for 30 minutes?

341
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,758
Well, we thought it would be
very funny...

342
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:36,563
to do an entire show...

343
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:39,069
where all you're doing
is waiting for the table.

344
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,944
Because we've all
been in that situation.

345
00:16:46,581 --> 00:16:50,048
You know, you're... You're waiting,
and you're hungry...

346
00:16:50,118 --> 00:16:53,210
and you bump into somebody
you know.

347
00:16:57,658 --> 00:17:00,750
- When is Russell coming back?
- So that's the idea?

348
00:17:01,996 --> 00:17:03,757
Well, no. That's one.

349
00:17:03,831 --> 00:17:05,193
We have many others.

350
00:17:05,266 --> 00:17:07,027
We have an idea where...

351
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:12,698
I... I get into an accident with a guy
who has no insurance...

352
00:17:12,773 --> 00:17:15,239
and the judge sentences him
to be my butler.

353
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:21,006
You know, and he cooks.
He has to cook for me.

354
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:23,207
And cleans my house...

355
00:17:23,284 --> 00:17:25,545
and he's doing my shopping,
you know.

356
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,047
And I'm walking around with
one of those big neck-collar things.

357
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:33,083
Those collars are funny.

358
00:17:33,161 --> 00:17:36,321
You see somebody in one of those,
you start laughing immediately.

359
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:39,595
Are you telling them
the butler story?

360
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:42,031
Is that beautiful or what?

361
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:43,727
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

362
00:17:44,005 --> 00:17:45,732
Russell?

363
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,233
- I'm Rita Kirson.
- Oh, Rita.

364
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,071
Hey, Mr. Schirmack. How are you?

365
00:17:51,145 --> 00:17:54,772
Good to see you, Stu and Jay.
Always a pleasure. Hi, sweetie.

366
00:17:54,849 --> 00:17:57,474
Yeah, yeah, that butler idea,
that's beautiful, isn't it?

367
00:17:57,552 --> 00:17:59,142
Is that a killer?

368
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,550
- I thought I was getting the butler.
- Don't worry.

369
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,155
We'll find something for you.

370
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:15,133
So Letterman didn't
spark to your idea, huh?

371
00:18:15,403 --> 00:18:17,903
He said there was nothing
he could do and next time...

372
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:20,632
I should probably break
the Prozacs in half.

373
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,169
Hey, wanna hold it down.
I'm watching JEOPARDY!

374
00:18:23,244 --> 00:18:25,778
Would you give him back the TV?

375
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,275
Oh, by the way, Susan called for you
a minute ago.

376
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:31,384
I'll bet they're probably doing
somersaults about us over there.

377
00:18:31,452 --> 00:18:34,544
You think they get butler stories
like that every day?

378
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:40,422
Who is Joseph Cotten? Giddyup.

379
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:43,122
- Hello?
- Yeah, hi, it's me. It's Georgie boy.

380
00:18:43,197 --> 00:18:45,527
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

381
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,793
What's going on? I'll tell you
what's going on.

382
00:18:47,868 --> 00:18:49,731
I'm fired.

383
00:18:49,804 --> 00:18:51,132
Fired, why?

384
00:18:51,205 --> 00:18:52,738
Because you kissed me.

385
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:55,102
You kissed me, you stupid idiot.

386
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,211
Rita called Russell, and he fired me
over the phone.

387
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:00,710
What is pi?

388
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,247
Giddyup again. I'm killing, man.

389
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:06,016
But I didn't... I had no idea...
I didn't realize.

390
00:19:06,087 --> 00:19:10,021
You didn't realize? How could you
not realize? You're stupid.

391
00:19:10,091 --> 00:19:12,989
You are a stupid, stupid man.

392
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,094
I just feel terrible.
This is just terrible.

393
00:19:15,162 --> 00:19:17,628
What is the cha-cha?

394
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,129
Yes, indeed.

395
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,198
I'll speak to you later.

396
00:19:25,239 --> 00:19:27,899
This is great. He fired her!

397
00:19:27,975 --> 00:19:31,476
This is incredible. He fired her!
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

398
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,546
- Why'd he fire her?
- Because I kissed her in the meeting!

399
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:36,945
Russell found out. He fired her
over the phone!

400
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:39,609
Finally, my stupidity pays off!

401
00:19:39,687 --> 00:19:43,279
What is "Here Come De Judge"?
"Here Come De Judge"!

402
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:47,385
You can't break up with her.
Her life is shattered. You got her fired.

403
00:19:47,461 --> 00:19:49,028
You gotta be there for her.

404
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:51,096
You gotta wait until
she gets another job.

405
00:19:51,165 --> 00:19:53,927
- Another job?
- A couple of interviews.

406
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:56,831
Oh, this is unbelievable.

407
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,063
I'm stuck.

408
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,071
Every time I think I'm out...

409
00:20:01,142 --> 00:20:03,710
they pull me back in.

410
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:13,948
Are you going to want to leave
after it's over?

411
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:15,713
You know, if we have sex.

412
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:18,948
What, leave? Where, why?

413
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,658
You know, the apartment.

414
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:25,864
- Why would I? This is my apartment.
- Well, what if it was my apartment?

415
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,898
Who gave you this idea
I would wanna leave?

416
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:31,597
Well, Elaine said men like to leave
after it's over.

417
00:20:31,672 --> 00:20:34,206
I wouldn't put stock in
anything Elaine has to say...

418
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:36,809
about relationships.
She comes from a broken home.

419
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:40,469
And I mean that literally. A tree fell
on the roof and cracked the structure.

420
00:20:40,548 --> 00:20:43,981
Her parents got along beautifully,
but the house was in bad shape.

421
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,646
Maybe I should be going.

422
00:20:49,423 --> 00:20:51,457
- And what else did you say to her?
- Nothing.

423
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:53,820
I was just giving her
the straight dope.

424
00:20:54,028 --> 00:20:57,291
More like a dope was giving it
to her straight.

425
00:20:57,365 --> 00:21:00,332
Another cup of coffee with you,
she'll wind up in a convent.

426
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:03,532
Listen, there was a lot more
I could've told her, believe me.

427
00:21:03,604 --> 00:21:06,036
What about leaving after sex?
Did I leave with you?

428
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,333
You might have, if I had stayed.

429
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,941
So you know what,
I got served with papers today.

430
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:14,205
Ping is suing me.

431
00:21:14,281 --> 00:21:16,372
I need your virgin as a witness,
so be nice.

432
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,881
I was trying to be.

433
00:21:18,352 --> 00:21:20,386
Look at George.
He lucked out, huh?

434
00:21:20,888 --> 00:21:24,116
You're not kidding. Who figured
Susan would break up with him?

435
00:21:24,191 --> 00:21:25,849
- They had a good thing going.
- Yeah.

436
00:21:25,926 --> 00:21:27,960
Since she met him,
she's been vomited on...

437
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:30,062
her family cabin's been
burned down...

438
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:34,065
learned her father's a homosexual
and got fired from a high-paying job.

439
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:38,303
Yeah, they had
a real good thing going.

440
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,602
What do I do?

441
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:44,042
Well, actually, I'm a writer.

442
00:21:44,111 --> 00:21:48,841
In fact, I'm writing a comedy pilot
for NBC right now.

443
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:51,483
A sitcom?

444
00:21:51,552 --> 00:21:55,088
How can you write that crap?

445
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:58,487
Carol. This guy's writing a sitcom.

446
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,627
A sitcom?

447
00:22:05,766 --> 00:22:07,265
A sitcom.

448
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:08,958
Can you imagine?

449
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,572
And he actually tried to use it
to hit on me.

450
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,676
In ancient tribal cultures,
they would actually sacrifice a virgin.

451
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:20,439
I mean, they would find some girl
that had never been with anybody...

452
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:24,380
and throw her into a volcano.
There's a first date you'll never forget.

453
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,345
She winds up in heaven,
talking with Chuck Woolery, so...

454
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:33,286
"Tell me, Lisa, how did the date end?"
"Not well, Chuck. Not well."

455
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,590
"Well, if you'd like to be thrown into
a volcano again, we'll pay for it."
