1
00:00:00,541 --> 00:00:06,354
Everything on planes is tiny. Tiny
food, tiny liquor bottles, tiny pillows...

2
00:00:06,432 --> 00:00:08,625
tiny bathroom,
tiny sink, tiny soap.

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:11,827
Everyone's in a cramped seat
working on a tiny computer.

4
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:14,336
Always a small problem.
"Be a slight delay.

5
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:17,101
You'll be a bit late.
If you could be a little patient.

6
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:19,676
We're just trying to get
one of those little trucks...

7
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:21,870
to pull us a little closer
to the Jetway...

8
00:00:21,948 --> 00:00:23,948
so you can walk down
the narrow hallway.

9
00:00:24,016 --> 00:00:27,449
There'll be a man in a tight suit.
He'll tell you you have little time...

10
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:30,783
to make your connecting flight.
So move it."

11
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,531
Hey, could you do me a favor?

12
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:46,638
Could you shut up?

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:48,739
Open the window, please.
It's hot in here.

14
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:52,275
- You're wearing that heavy jacket.
- Fine, I'll take it off. Grab the wheel.

15
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:54,504
- I don't want to do that.
- Come on. Just do it.

16
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,342
- No, I don't like to do this.
- Elaine, just get it.

17
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,643
- My hand is stuck.
- Okay, don't fool around.

18
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:02,185
- My hand. My hand!
- Don't... Jer... All right, fine.

19
00:01:02,255 --> 00:01:04,516
Elaine.

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,317
Hey, guess what.

21
00:01:06,392 --> 00:01:09,552
- This window doesn't work.
- I hate rental cars. Nothing ever works.

22
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:11,629
Window doesn't work.
Radio doesn't work.

23
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:13,424
And it smells like a cheap hooker.

24
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:15,198
Or is that you?

25
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,996
Give me 10 bucks and find out.

26
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,467
So this worked out pretty good.

27
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:25,407
Them giving me an extra ticket. You
get a trip to St. Louis. I did my gig.

28
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:28,012
- You got to see your sister.
- Yeah, it worked out good.

29
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,613
- And here's the beauty.
- What?

30
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:31,477
George is picking us up
at the airport.

31
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,710
- Get out of here. Why?
- You know that awning...

32
00:01:33,786 --> 00:01:35,945
- outside my building?
- Yeah.

33
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:37,953
He always brags
about his vertical leap...

34
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:41,218
so I bet him 50 bucks that
he couldn't touch the awning.

35
00:01:41,294 --> 00:01:45,023
- So, what happened?
- He didn't come within 2 feet of it.

36
00:01:45,164 --> 00:01:47,323
He's waving at it.

37
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,027
So I told him if he picks us up at the
airport, he wouldn't have to pay me.

38
00:01:51,103 --> 00:01:53,228
Hey, how we doing on time?

39
00:01:53,306 --> 00:01:54,805
Timed out perfectly.

40
00:01:54,874 --> 00:01:58,205
Drop off the car, pick up the rental-car
shuttle, we walk on the plane.

41
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,178
- Wait up!
- Wait up!

42
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:06,011
- Sorry.
- Wait!

43
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,057
- Where you going?
- JFK.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,525
I need some small bills
for a tip, got any?

45
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:18,926
- Yeah. You want a 5?
- Give me a 10.

46
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,362
- You're giving him $10?
- Well, we got three bags.

47
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,661
- That's a pretty big tip.
- That's what they get.

48
00:02:23,736 --> 00:02:26,066
- They don't get that much.
- Let's ask him.

49
00:02:26,138 --> 00:02:28,832
- You can't ask him.
- Let's see what he says.

50
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:30,999
- Jerry, we don't have time.
- Two seconds.

51
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:32,542
Excuse me.

52
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,509
My friend and I
were having a discussion.

53
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:37,513
We were just wondering
what you usually get for a tip.

54
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,948
- Depends on the person and the bag.
- How about people like us?

55
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,382
People like you?

56
00:02:42,455 --> 00:02:44,716
Not much.
You don't know what you're doing.

57
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,724
- Come on, seriously.
- Well, since you asked.

58
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,624
Usually, I get $5 a bag.

59
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,964
- What?
- That's right.

60
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:57,967
- Five dollars a bag? I don't think so.
- Look, you asked, I told you.

61
00:02:58,437 --> 00:03:00,732
You got some nerve
trying to take advantage of us.

62
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,773
All right, look, we're late.
Thank you very much.

63
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:06,241
- You're lucky I don't report you.
- Come on.

64
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,406
JFK.

65
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:13,416
Honolulu.

66
00:03:14,453 --> 00:03:16,544
Wait up.

67
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:19,320
See? Never be late
for a plane with a girl.

68
00:03:19,392 --> 00:03:23,258
Because a girl runs like a girl, with the
little steps and the arms flailing out.

69
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:25,987
You wanna make this plane,
you gotta run like a man.

70
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,395
Get your knees up!

71
00:03:30,803 --> 00:03:35,067
- The flight's been canceled?
- Everything into JFK is booked.

72
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:37,266
Wait, I have two seats
into La Guardia...

73
00:03:37,343 --> 00:03:39,502
but they're not together.
It's boarding now.

74
00:03:39,578 --> 00:03:41,578
- We'll take them.
- We won't sit together?

75
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,442
So what? It's not long. You'll read.

76
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,846
What about George?
He's picking us up at Kennedy.

77
00:03:45,918 --> 00:03:47,508
- We'll call him.
- There's no time.

78
00:03:47,586 --> 00:03:49,119
- Is there time?
- There's no time.

79
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,483
There's no time.
We'll call him from the plane.

80
00:03:51,557 --> 00:03:54,319
I have one seat in first class
and one in coach.

81
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:57,360
The price is the same
because your flight was canceled.

82
00:03:57,997 --> 00:03:59,655
Well...

83
00:03:59,732 --> 00:04:01,527
I'll take the first class.

84
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,997
- Jerry.
- What?

85
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,796
Why should you get
the first class?

86
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,165
Elaine, have you ever
flown first class?

87
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,966
- No.
- All right, then.

88
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,665
You won't know
what you're missing.

89
00:04:10,743 --> 00:04:13,368
I've flown first class, Elaine.
I can't go back to coach.

90
00:04:13,446 --> 00:04:16,606
- I can't. I won't.
- You flew here coach.

91
00:04:16,682 --> 00:04:20,274
- Yeah, that's a point.
- All right, fine. I don't care.

92
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:23,820
The plane crashes, everybody in
first class is gonna die anyway.

93
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:26,321
Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.

94
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:32,096
Third row, right.

95
00:04:32,164 --> 00:04:34,391
Oh, you're in here, sir.
Welcome aboard.

96
00:04:34,934 --> 00:04:36,501
Bon voyage, Lainey.

97
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:45,872
Oh, excuse me.

98
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:51,480
Excuse me, Miss.
I think you're sitting in my seat.

99
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:52,878
What?

100
00:04:52,952 --> 00:04:55,077
- Yeah, 13C. That's me.
- Sorry.

101
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:56,983
No, that's all right.

102
00:05:12,338 --> 00:05:15,703
I never check my bags. Can't stand
that waiting in the baggage area.

103
00:05:16,575 --> 00:05:17,903
Great.

104
00:05:21,313 --> 00:05:23,347
Help me.

105
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:30,082
Excuse me.
I think you're in my seat.

106
00:05:30,456 --> 00:05:32,547
Oh, really?

107
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,591
My mistake.

108
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,619
My mistake.

109
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,260
Thank you.

110
00:05:45,838 --> 00:05:48,406
- Hey, thanks for coming with me.
- Oh, yeah.

111
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:50,974
What made you think
you could touch that awning?

112
00:05:52,044 --> 00:05:53,702
I confused it with another awning.

113
00:05:54,213 --> 00:05:56,213
Man.

114
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:59,316
- So how we doing on time?
- We're perfect.

115
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,749
I timed this out so we'd
pull up at the terminal...

116
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,617
exactly 17 minutes after their flight
is supposed to land.

117
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,054
That gives them enough time
to get off the plane...

118
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:11,424
pick up their bags, and be walking
out of the terminal as we roll up.

119
00:06:11,497 --> 00:06:13,497
I tell you, it's a thing of beauty.

120
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:17,625
I cannot express to you the feeling
I get from a perfect pickup.

121
00:06:17,703 --> 00:06:19,430
- What are you doing?
- What?

122
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:22,665
What are you getting on the
Long Island Expressway for?

123
00:06:22,741 --> 00:06:25,810
You know what the traffic will be like?
This is a suicide mission!

124
00:06:25,878 --> 00:06:29,038
- Will you relax?
- I had it perfectly timed out.

125
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:32,206
The Grand Central. The Van Wyck.
You've destroyed my whole timing.

126
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:33,749
This is the best way to go.

127
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:35,648
Do you know what happens
if I miss him?

128
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:38,289
I don't get credit for the pickup,
and I lose my $50.

129
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,618
George, there's no traffic
at this time. Come on.

130
00:06:40,693 --> 00:06:41,987
Really?

131
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:44,925
If anything, we'll probably
get there early.

132
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:48,931
I'll have a chance to
go to the duty-free shop.

133
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,791
- The duty-free shop?
- Yeah.

134
00:06:52,538 --> 00:06:56,130
Duty-free is the biggest
sucker deal in retail.

135
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,435
- You know how much duty is?
- Duty?

136
00:06:58,911 --> 00:07:02,811
- Yeah. You know how much duty is?
- No, I don't know how much duty is.

137
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:06,213
Duty's nothing. It's like sales tax.

138
00:07:06,285 --> 00:07:09,183
Well, I'd still like to stop
at the duty-free shop.

139
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:13,524
I like to stop
At the duty-free shop

140
00:07:13,592 --> 00:07:16,320
I like to stop
At the duty-free shop

141
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,123
I like to stop
At the duty-free shop

142
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,064
So he says,
"Squeeze your breasts together."

143
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:28,002
And I say, "I thought
this was an ad for shoes."

144
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,537
Oh, my.

145
00:07:34,146 --> 00:07:36,043
- Is that the new Esquire?
- Yeah.

146
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,683
Turn to page 146.

147
00:07:41,353 --> 00:07:44,013
Coming out of the shower.

148
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:47,587
Good thing they gave you that
washcloth to cover yourself up.

149
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:49,922
What is this an ad for?

150
00:07:49,995 --> 00:07:52,825
See those wrinkled jeans
slung over the chair?

151
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:56,195
Way in the background,
out of focus?

152
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:05,709
How does it look on your side?

153
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:13,776
We'll get there.

154
00:08:13,852 --> 00:08:15,749
Oh, look at this.

155
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:18,856
He's sleeping, and I have to go
to the bathroom.

156
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,219
Maybe he'll wake up soon.

157
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:24,018
What if my kidneys burst?

158
00:08:24,496 --> 00:08:28,623
Is it worth it not to wake this man up
to damage a major organ?

159
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:33,238
I hope this disgusting slob
appreciates what I'm doing for him.

160
00:08:33,672 --> 00:08:37,230
Yeah, make a little more noise
with your gum. That's helpful.

161
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:42,606
They're not here.
You cost me 50 bucks.

162
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:47,047
Look at you. You run like a girl. Come
on. Run like a man. Lift your knees.

163
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,054
We're wasting our time here.
We're a half-hour late.

164
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:54,783
They probably took it
off the board!

165
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,656
No, there it is. Right there, 133.
And it's canceled.

166
00:08:58,063 --> 00:09:00,859
Canceled?
Do I still get credit for the pickup?

167
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,194
- I was here.
- Let's check at the ticket counter.

168
00:09:03,268 --> 00:09:06,565
There it is, honey.
Gate 18A, 8:30.

169
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:10,772
Did you see that guy?

170
00:09:10,843 --> 00:09:12,638
- No. What guy?
- That guy. He was...

171
00:09:12,711 --> 00:09:14,506
standing right here.
- No, I didn't.

172
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,147
Go over to the ticket counter.

173
00:09:16,215 --> 00:09:18,840
I'll go to the gift shop and
get a copy of TIME magazine.

174
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:22,248
There's supposed to be a blurb about
Jerry. I think he mentioned my name.

175
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:24,412
I know that guy.

176
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,148
Yeah.

177
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,422
Gotta get my TIME magazine.
Never miss my TIME.

178
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:33,121
Okay, get your magazine.
Let's get out of here.

179
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:36,098
Hey. I was gonna take that.

180
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:39,537
Gee, I'm sorry. I got here first.

181
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:42,367
- I don't care. I want the magazine.
- Okay, let's go.

182
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:45,032
You don't understand.
There's a blurb about me in this.

183
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,202
A blurb? You're a blurb.
Check out the cover, idiot.

184
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,870
- Let's go.
- Just give me second.

185
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:52,778
- I want the magazine!
- No.

186
00:09:52,851 --> 00:09:56,216
You know what I would do to you
if I wasn't in these shackles?

187
00:09:56,288 --> 00:10:00,381
But you are, Blanche.
You are in the shackles.

188
00:10:00,459 --> 00:10:02,186
You little son of a...

189
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:07,961
Oh, I can't wait to read
my TIME magazine. Last copy too.

190
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,533
Maybe I'll read it tomorrow,
in the park.

191
00:10:10,602 --> 00:10:14,968
Supposed to be a beautiful day.
Have a nice life...

192
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,200
sentence, that is. You miserable...

193
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:22,177
They're on a different flight.

194
00:10:22,247 --> 00:10:24,975
They're scheduled to land
in half an hour at La Guardia.

195
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,412
La Guardia? Right, come on.

196
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:27,847
- Wait a second.
- Come on.

197
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,387
- Where do I know that guy from?
- We gotta go, come on.

198
00:10:31,657 --> 00:10:35,215
Wake up, you human slug.
Wake up.

199
00:10:35,294 --> 00:10:37,885
Wake up!

200
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,326
I can't hold it anymore.

201
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,303
Excuse me.
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

202
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:47,836
I've gotta go to the bathroom.

203
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:50,536
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:54,742
Can you move that?

205
00:10:54,813 --> 00:10:57,541
Would you move
your seat up, please?

206
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:12,363
Oh, my, that is refreshing.

207
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,465
Would you care for some slippers?

208
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:16,828
- Sounds lovely.
- Here you are.

209
00:11:16,902 --> 00:11:19,197
Thank you very much. May I?

210
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:21,636
Please.

211
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:29,070
Why, it's a perfect fit.
You must be Cinderella.

212
00:11:34,186 --> 00:11:36,117
My name is not mentioned
in this blurb.

213
00:11:36,188 --> 00:11:38,916
- That's it. It's Grossbard.
- Do you believe this?

214
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,719
- Nowhere to be found.
- I knew that face looked familiar.

215
00:11:41,794 --> 00:11:44,727
- It's Grossbard.
- Who's Grossbard?

216
00:11:44,797 --> 00:11:47,889
When I lived on Third Avenue
and 18th Street, 20 years ago...

217
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:51,194
I had this roommate who was
always behind in his rent.

218
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,273
One month, he asked me to loan him
his share of the rent, 240 bucks.

219
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,136
He took the cash and...

220
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:59,538
disappears.

221
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,908
I tried to find him. I went to his
girlfriend's house, even his family.

222
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,641
Never got that money back.
He screwed me.

223
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:08,308
And that's the guy. John Grossbard.

224
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:11,320
Kramer, come on.
It was 240 bucks 20 years ago.

225
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:13,617
- I'm gonna turn around, get that guy.
- You can't.

226
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:15,919
- Let go of me.
- Kramer, you cannot go back.

227
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:18,654
Kramer, you cannot abandon
people in an airport pickup.

228
00:12:19,164 --> 00:12:21,255
It's a binding social contract.

229
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:25,701
We must go forward. Not back.

230
00:12:43,422 --> 00:12:46,889
Tia, did you see all the flowers
in that bathroom?

231
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,619
- It's like an English garden in there.
- They're beautiful.

232
00:12:49,695 --> 00:12:51,126
They're gardenias, mostly.

233
00:12:51,196 --> 00:12:54,993
- I thought I smelled lilac.
- Yes, there are a few of those too.

234
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,566
It's almost overwhelming.

235
00:12:56,635 --> 00:12:58,794
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain.

236
00:12:58,871 --> 00:13:01,804
Due to equipment problems
on the runway at La Guardia...

237
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:06,411
we've been instructed by the tower
to reroute and land at JFK.

238
00:13:06,478 --> 00:13:08,808
We apologize
for any inconvenience.

239
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:10,710
What did he say?
What did he say?

240
00:13:15,621 --> 00:13:19,054
- Well, you're not gonna believe it.
- What?

241
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:21,852
The plane's rerouted back
to Kennedy. We got 45 minutes.

242
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:27,624
Let's go. Listen to the bell,
Grossbard. It tolls for thee.

243
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:36,572
We have some
delicious Chateaubriand.

244
00:13:36,642 --> 00:13:40,109
My personal favorite.
Or if you prefer something lighter...

245
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:45,511
a poached Dover sole in a delicate
white-wine sauce with a hint of saffron.

246
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,084
Oh, saffron. That sounds good.

247
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:50,881
And today we're featuring wines
from the Tuscany region.

248
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:54,351
- Tuscany.
- Tuscany.

249
00:13:58,897 --> 00:14:01,727
Hi. Can I get to my seat?

250
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,233
You're just gonna have to wait.

251
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:09,496
I'm right there. You just passed it.
I'm sitting next to that guy.

252
00:14:09,574 --> 00:14:12,302
You're not supposed to get up
during the food service.

253
00:14:12,377 --> 00:14:14,775
Well, nobody told me that.

254
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:17,277
Look. This plane is full.

255
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:20,612
I got a lot of people to serve.
Now, please.

256
00:14:20,686 --> 00:14:22,913
You're just gonna have to wait.

257
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,388
There it is. Gate 46.
We got plenty of time.

258
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,551
Grossbard's plane
leaves in 10 minutes.

259
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,219
I've still got time to catch him.

260
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:35,093
How? He probably boarded
the plane already.

261
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,161
Give me your credit card.

262
00:14:37,235 --> 00:14:39,667
- My credit card?
- Give it to me. Don't ask questions.

263
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:42,534
I'm not giving you my card
unless you tell me what it's for.

264
00:14:42,607 --> 00:14:44,675
To buy a ticket
to get on that flight.

265
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,473
You'll spend more for the ticket
than you'll get from Grossbard.

266
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:49,978
I'm not gonna use the ticket.

267
00:14:50,048 --> 00:14:53,311
I'll get my money, get off the plane,
turn your ticket in for a refund.

268
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:54,747
Not gonna cost you a dime.

269
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:59,084
- Come on, give me the card.
- This is a great idea. Here.

270
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:03,057
Use this one. I get frequent flyer
miles with every purchase.

271
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:05,128
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

272
00:15:05,664 --> 00:15:07,595
Get two tickets.

273
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,234
You're returning it anyway,
what's the difference?

274
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:14,361
- I'll get double the bonus miles.
- Yes. Yes.

275
00:15:16,274 --> 00:15:17,602
Excuse me.

276
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:20,438
I'm sorry to make you do this,
but I got stuck in the aisle.

277
00:15:20,512 --> 00:15:22,637
The flight attendant
wouldn't let me through.

278
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,679
There's no way
to get around that cart.

279
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,182
You're not supposed to get up
during food service.

280
00:15:27,252 --> 00:15:29,684
I'll try and remember that.

281
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,654
Where's my meal?

282
00:15:35,727 --> 00:15:40,196
He asked me. But you were gone
so long, I thought you switched seats.

283
00:15:40,298 --> 00:15:44,334
Excuse me. Excuse me,
I didn't get a meal.

284
00:15:44,403 --> 00:15:47,165
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

285
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:50,399
I would know if a tray of food
had been served to me.

286
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:54,574
- Would you?
- Yes.

287
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:57,313
Well, the only meal left
is a kosher meal.

288
00:15:57,516 --> 00:16:00,608
A kosher meal?
I don't want a kosher meal.

289
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:03,049
I don't even know
what a kosher meal is.

290
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:06,520
I think it means when a rabbi
has inspected it or something.

291
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:10,684
No, no, it all has to do
with the way they kill the pig.

292
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:14,332
- Come on, but they don't eat pigs.
- They do if it's killed right.

293
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,865
- Under a rabbi's supervision.
- Oh, you know what?

294
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,627
I ordered the kosher meal.

295
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:23,240
- Then why didn't you take it?
- I ordered it six weeks ago. I forgot.

296
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:25,774
You're eating my food.

297
00:16:25,844 --> 00:16:29,209
Hey, I got earplugs to collect.
Do you want it or not?

298
00:16:31,316 --> 00:16:34,317
- This is the best sundae I've ever had.
- Oh, man.

299
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:35,919
You know what?

300
00:16:35,987 --> 00:16:37,679
They got the fudge on the bottom.

301
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:41,190
You see? That enables you to
control your fudge distribution...

302
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:43,190
as you're eating your ice cream.

303
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,592
I never met a man who knew
so much about nothing.

304
00:16:46,665 --> 00:16:48,460
Thank you.

305
00:16:57,609 --> 00:17:00,473
- More anything?
- More everything.

306
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,246
Look. I did good.
I got supersavers. Come on.

307
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,974
Supersavers? Are they refundable?

308
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,484
You bought nonrefundable tickets.
You idiot.

309
00:17:11,556 --> 00:17:13,988
She talked me into it.
Said it was the best deal.

310
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:16,627
- Do you know how much this'll cost?
- I'll tell you what.

311
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,126
I'll split it with you, huh?

312
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:32,001
- Listen, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Okay, okay.

313
00:17:38,383 --> 00:17:40,178
Hey.

314
00:17:41,553 --> 00:17:43,348
- How about that, huh?
- Excuse me?

315
00:17:43,421 --> 00:17:45,352
- Do you recognize me?
- No.

316
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,923
- Come on. Twenty years ago.
- What?

317
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:50,926
- Eighteenth Street?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

318
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:52,927
Give me your money.
Where's your wallet?

319
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:54,531
The $240.

320
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:57,998
Just a minute.

321
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:01,095
Hey, buddy.

322
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,568
Kramer!

323
00:18:12,984 --> 00:18:14,551
George!

324
00:18:38,777 --> 00:18:41,243
Sorry. I'm sorry.

325
00:18:41,313 --> 00:18:42,971
Sorry.

326
00:19:00,398 --> 00:19:02,728
Excuse me.

327
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:07,434
Excuse me.

328
00:19:07,505 --> 00:19:11,564
What? Oh, no, nothing for me,
thank you. I'm fine.

329
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:13,768
What is your name?

330
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:15,173
Elaine Benes.

331
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:20,708
You're going to have to
go back to coach.

332
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,580
But there was nobody sitting here.

333
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:26,212
Yes, but you're still not allowed.
These seats are very expensive.

334
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,384
No. Please don't send me back there.
I'll do anything. It's so nice up here.

335
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,326
It's so comfortable up here.
I don't wanna go back there.

336
00:19:33,398 --> 00:19:35,432
Please, don't send me back there.

337
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,499
Oh, you got cookies.

338
00:19:38,837 --> 00:19:40,962
You're going to have to
go back to your seat.

339
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,603
Okay, fine. I'll go back.

340
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:50,075
You know, our goal should be
a society without classes.

341
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,645
Do you realize the people up here
are getting cookies?!

342
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:01,255
What is all the racket back there?

343
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:04,884
You're trying to relax on the plane, and
this is what you have to put up with.

344
00:20:04,963 --> 00:20:06,257
What is going on?

345
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,195
Sir, this woman tried
to sneak into first class.

346
00:20:09,267 --> 00:20:11,096
Oh, you see, that's terrible.

347
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,169
The problem is
that curtain is no security.

348
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:16,171
There really should be
a locking door.

349
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:19,367
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

350
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,603
Sorry.

351
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:25,505
Hey!

352
00:20:26,284 --> 00:20:29,785
Come on. Let go of me. I'm telling
you, I didn't do anything wrong.

353
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:34,448
- That guy owes me 240 bucks.
- Listen, pal, you're in big trouble.

354
00:20:52,277 --> 00:20:53,867
Couldn't be.

355
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,217
Where are they already?
I don't see them anywhere.

356
00:21:01,286 --> 00:21:04,082
I got my bags. I'm ready to go.

357
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:06,524
Yeah, you got your bags.

358
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:15,828
That was the worst flight
I've ever been on in my entire life.

359
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,558
Yeah, me too.

360
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,228
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

361
00:21:23,074 --> 00:21:25,165
It's a business thing.

362
00:21:29,114 --> 00:21:30,841
Hey.

363
00:21:30,915 --> 00:21:33,040
- You guys ready?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:35,116
Where's George?

365
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:44,993
Kramer!

366
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,860
But I have to admit that I like flying.
I like those...

367
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:54,903
little bathrooms that
they have on the plane.

368
00:21:54,973 --> 00:21:57,633
It's like a small apartment
of your own on the plane.

369
00:21:57,709 --> 00:21:59,800
You go in, close the door,
the light comes on.

370
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:02,446
It's like a surprise party
every time you go in there.

371
00:22:02,514 --> 00:22:04,946
But the worst way
of flying, I think, is standby.

372
00:22:05,016 --> 00:22:07,107
You ever fly standby?
It never works.

373
00:22:07,185 --> 00:22:11,051
That's why they call it "standby. "You
end up standing there going, "Bye.

374
00:22:11,322 --> 00:22:12,855
I didn't...

375
00:22:12,924 --> 00:22:14,286
Yeah."

376
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,586
I was on this plane
where the flight attendant...

377
00:22:16,661 --> 00:22:20,288
It was her first day on the job. So
they didn't have a uniform for her yet.

378
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:22,592
And that really makes
a big difference.

379
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:25,099
Here's just some regular person
coming over, going:

380
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,670
"Would you bring
your seatback all the way up?"

381
00:22:27,739 --> 00:22:30,273
"Who the hell are you?"

382
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:32,501
She says,
"I'm the flight attendant."

383
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:34,611
"Yeah, well,
then I'm the pilot, all right?

384
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:37,646
So why don't you sit down?
I'm about to bring her in."

385
00:22:38,305 --> 00:22:44,543
