Whenever you ask for the doggy bag
in a restaurant...
there's a sense of
failure there, isn't there?
People always whisper it
to the waiter, "Excuse me...
I'm sorry, you're gonna have
to give me the doggy bag.
I couldn't make it."
It is embarrassing because
a doggy bag means either...
you were at a restaurant
when you're not hungry...
or you've chosen the stupidest
way to get dog food that there is.
How about the doggy bag
on a date?
That's a good move for a guy, huh?
Let me tell you, if you're a guy and you
ask for the doggy bag on a date...
you might as well have them
just wrap up your genitals too.
You're not gonna be needing
those for a while either.
**LOL**
# JERRY
**LOL**
 Is that bothering you?
# ELAINE
 No. Not at all.
# ELAINE
It's the BMW.
Oh, could you please hurry?
# JERRY
"Please hurry."
**LOL**
Look at you.
Look what you've become.
# ELAINE
What? What have I become?
I haven't become anything.
# JERRY
Oh, Carl can't wait a few...
more minutes?
# ELAINE
 I don't want to keep him waiting.
# JERRY
 He'll like you more.
# ELAINE
 That's impossible.
**LOL**
Stan, why do you have to
pick your teeth at the table?
 Leave me alone.
**LOL**
 It's disgusting.
Yeah, I'm gonna get married
real soon.
**LOL**
 So where am I dropping you?
 His place.
Guy's got quite a racket.
I take you to dinner...
then drop you at his apartment.
And he gets the rest of my chicken.
**LOL**
# JERRY
So is tonight the night?
# ELAINE
You never know.
# JERRY
Baby doll.
Thank you, brother.
# JERRY
What, do you smell something?
# ELAINE
Do I smell something?
What am I, hard of smelling?
**LOL**
 Of course I smell something.
# JERRY
 What is it?
# ELAINE
I think its BO.
**LOL**
# JERRY
What?
# ELAINE
It's BO.
The valet must've had BO.
**LOL**
# JERRY
It can't be. Nobody has BO like this.
# ELAINE
Jerry, its BO.
# JERRY
But the whole car smells.
# ELAINE
 So?
# JERRY
 So when somebody has BO...
the O usually stays with the B.
**LOL**
Once the B leaves,
the O goes with it.
**LOL**
**LOL**
Oh, my God.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 I can't believe you ski.
# CARL
 I'm a great skier.
# ELAINE
Yeah, what else?
# CARL
Let's see. I ski, I fish...
I pillage, I plunder.
# ELAINE
 You pillage and plunder?
# CARL
 When I travel.
# ELAINE
See, finally, finally I get
to meet a man...
who pillages and plunders.
I'm so lucky.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 It should only take a second.
# KRAMER
 Yeah, I'm gonna poke around.
# GEORGE
Hey, what do you know?
Look at that.
A lesbian sighting.
**LOL**
My lucky day.
They're so fascinating. Why is that?
Because they don't want us.
**LOL**
You gotta respect that.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Oh, my God.
It's Susan! But what do I do?
**LOL**
# SUSAN
George?
# GEORGE
 Susan. Hi.
 Hi.
Oh, boy.
What are you doing here?
# SUSAN
 Renting a video.
 Right.
What do you got there?
# GEORGE
Oh, some... some stupid movie.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
This is Mona.
# GEORGE
Hi.
**LOL**
# MONA
 Pleasure to meet you.
# GEORGE
 Yes. Well...
# MONA
Well, I'll let you two catch up.
# SUSAN
 You okay?
# GEORGE
 Yeah. Yes.
I just haven't seen you
in a long time.
# SUSAN
And you didn't expect me to be
holding hands with a woman.
# GEORGE
Oh, please. Me?
**LOL**
Come on, that's great.
Are you kidding?
I think that's fantastic.
**LOL**
I've always encouraged
experimentation.
I'm the first guy in the pool.
Who do you think you're talking to?
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 I know who I'm talking to.
# GEORGE
 Of course you do.
**LOL**
It's just, you know,
I never knew that...
# SUSAN
 I like women?
# GEORGE
 There you go.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
So how long has this
been going on?
# SUSAN
Since you and I broke up.
# GEORGE
So after me, you...
went that way?
# SUSAN
Yeah.
# GEORGE
I think that's fantastic. Good for you.
**LOL**
Nice. That's very nice.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 So, what do you got there?
# GEORGE
 I don't...
# SUSAN
 Rochelle, Rochelle.
 Yeah.
# GEORGE
It's a foreign movie.
A film is what it is, actually.
# SUSAN
 A lot of nudity in that, huh?
# GEORGE
 No, no, just a tiny bit.
It's not even frontal nudity.
It's "sidal" nudity.
**LOL**
# CLERK
Next.
# GEORGE
 That's me.
# SUSAN
 Good seeing you, George.
# GEORGE
Yes, good to see you too.
And good luck with...
With the whole thing there.
**LOL**
# CLERK
What are you returning?
# GEORGE
# CLERK
Rochelle, Rochelle.
Oh, Rochelle, Rochelle.
A young girl's strange...
erotic journey from Milan to Minsk?
 Yeah. Yeah.
**LOL**
# CLERK
That'll be $3.49.
# GEORGE
Three forty-nine? It says $1.49.
# CLERK
You didn't rewind it. There's
a $2 charge for not rewinding.
# GEORGE
But there's no signs here.
 This is an outrage.
# KRAMER
 Don't give him any money for that.
It'll cost you less to keep it
another day, rewind it...
and bring it back tomorrow.
Don't give him the satisfaction.
# GEORGE
I'm not giving you the satisfaction.
I'm gonna watch it again.
How could that hurt?
**LOL**
# JERRY
So this morning I go down
to the garage to check the car out.
I figure by this time,
the odor molecules have had...
at least 12 hours to "de-smellify."
 Right.
**LOL**
I open the car door...
like a punch in the face...
**LOL**
the stench hits me.
It's almost as if it had gained strength
throughout the night.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
You know, I can think of at least
six known offensive odors...
that I would rather smell
than what's living in your car.
# JERRY
 What about skunk?
# ELAINE
 I don't mind skunk.
# JERRY
 Horse manure?
# ELAINE
 I love horse manure.
**LOL**
# JERRY
I've never seen anything like this
in my life.
In fact, I went to the car wash...
they want $250 to detail it
and get the smell out.
I'm not paying for that.
That's not my responsibility.
I'm driving to that restaurant,
and demand they pay for it.
# ELAINE
Absolutely.
# ELAINE
Listen, let me ask you something.
When you're with a guy and he
tells you he has to get up early...
what does that mean?
# JERRY
 It means he's lying.
# ELAINE
# JERRY
 Why, is that what he told you?
# ELAINE
 Yeah. Last night.
Oh, come on. Men have to
get up early sometime.
# JERRY
No. Never.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Jerry, I'm sure I've seen men on
the street early in the morning.
# JERRY
Well, sometimes we do
have to get up early...
but a man will always
trade sleep for sex.
# ELAINE
Is it possible I'm not as attractive
as I think I am?
# JERRY
Anything's possible.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Yeah.
 What's the matter with you?
# KRAMER
 Steinbrenner!
 He's ruining my life.
# JERRY
 Oh, yes.
 Steinbrenner.
# KRAMER
 I can't take another season with him.
He just traded away
their best prospects...
just like he did with Buhner,
McGee, Drabeck, McGriff.
# JERRY
I know the list.
# KRAMER
What's that smell?
# JERRY
What..? What smell?
**LOL**
# KRAMER
You stink.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 What do you mean, I stink?
# KRAMER
 You stink.
 Why don't you take a shower.
# JERRY
 I showered.
Oh, wait a second.
Since I showered, I've been in the car.
# ELAINE
 So?
# JERRY
 Don't you see what's happening?
It's attached itself to me. It's alive.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
If it's attached itself to you...
Oh, my God.
That's why Carl said he had to
get up early, because I stink.
Jerry, he thinks I have BO. Me.
**LOL**
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's George.
 I'm coming right down.
 All right, what happened?
# KRAMER
 What happened?
# JERRY
My car stinks is what happened.
And it's destroying the lives
of everyone in its path.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 This is BO?
 Yes.
# JERRY
# GEORGE
 This is unbelievable BO.
# JERRY
 I know.
**LOL**
At the car wash, the guy told me
in 38 years in the business...
he's never smelled anything like it.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
So let me ask you, do you think
I could've done this?
# JERRY
No, no. It's the valet guy.
# GEORGE
No, no. I mean, driven Susan
to lesbianism.
# JERRY
Oh, no. That's ridiculous.
# GEORGE
What if her experience with me
drove her to it.
# JERRY
Suicide, maybe. Not lesbianism.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
The woman she was
"lesbianing" with...
Susan told me she's never
been with a guy.
# GEORGE
Oh, this isn't even BO.
This is beyond BO. It's BBO.
# JERRY
There should be a BO squad
that patrols the city...
**LOL**
to sniff them out, strip them down
and wash them with a soapy brush.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
The funny thing is, somehow
I find her more appealing now.
Like, if I knew she was
a lesbian when we went out...
I never would've
broken up with her.
# JERRY
Let me see if I understand this.
On second thought...
**LOL**
# JERRY
Oh, my God, there he is.
That's the guy.
No, thank you. Go back.
No, go back.
**LOL**
No, back, back.
Go back. I got it. I'll park it.
**LOL**
I'll park it. Go back. You go back.
Sorry. Thank you. Thank you, no.
**LOL**
# RESTAURATEUR
What do you mean "stunk up"?
# JERRY
I mean the car stinks.
George, does the car stink?
# GEORGE
 Stinks.
# JERRY
 Stinks.
**LOL**
# RESTAURATEUR
Well, perhaps you're the one
who has the odor.
# JERRY
I've never smelled in my life, buddy.
# RESTAURATEUR
 Really? Well, I can smell you now.
# JERRY
 That's from the car.
# RESTAURATEUR
Maybe you stunk up the car,
rather than the car stinking up you.
# GEORGE
Oh, it's the chicken and the egg.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# JERRY
Thank you very much.
Well then, go out and smell the car.
See which smells worse.
# RESTAURATEUR
I don't have time to smell cars.
# GEORGE
Forget about smelling the car.
Smell the valet. Go to the source.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 You gotta smell the car.
# RESTAURATEUR
 I'm a busy man.
# JERRY
Come on. One whiff.
**LOL**
# RESTAURATEUR
All right. One whiff.
**LOL**
# RESTAURATEUR
All right. I give up. I
admit it, it stinks.
**LOL**
Now could you let me out?
# JERRY
 Yeah, you'll pay for the cleaning?
 Yes, $50. I'll give you $50.
**LOL**
 Fifty dollars, that's not gonna cover it.
# RESTAURATEUR
 Whatever you want.
**LOL**
 I'll give you whatever you want!
 I want half, 125.
Yes! Yes, 125 is good.
Now could you please open the door!
**LOL**
 All right.
 Let me out of here!
 Oh, my God.
 What?
The video. Someone stole
the video right out of the car.
**LOL**
 Someone stole Rochelle, Rochelle?
 Well, you left the window open.
**LOL**
We had to air out the car.
 You should pay for it.
# RESTAURATEUR
 I'm not paying for that.
They already got my $7.
Erotic journey from Milan to Minsk.
**LOL**
# CARL
 The valet had such bad BO?
# ELAINE
 Oh, man, just rampant, mutant BO.
**LOL**
The O went from the valet's B
to the car to me.
It clings to everything.
Jerry thinks it's an entity.
**LOL**
But I showered,
and I shampooed. So...
# CARL
 That's a relief.
 Yeah.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 What?
# CARL
 It's still there.
# ELAINE
No, no, it can't be.
I shampooed. I rinsed.
 I repeated.
 It's still there. I smelled it.
I don't smell anything.
Take another smell.
 No. No.
 No, here, just...
**LOL**
Please!
Which movie was that again?
Rochelle, Rochelle.
George.
Hey. Thanks for meeting me here.
 Yeah, I don't have much time.
# GEORGE
 Yeah, listen, I gotta ask you...
I was a little concerned that...
perhaps I was responsible
in some way for your...
metamorphosis.
**LOL**
# CLERK
That'll be $98.
# GEORGE
What $98?
# CLERK
That's what I said, $98.
# GEORGE
How could that piece
of crap cost $98?
 George, I really have...
**LOL**
 Do you believe this?
Ninety-eight dollars!
Do you have any cash?
**LOL**
I guess.
I need, like, 35. Thanks.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
So was it me?
# SUSAN
Oh, don't be ridiculous. Is that what
you wanted to talk to me about?
 Here.
# GEORGE
 Oh, thanks.
 Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.
# SUSAN
 Yeah, sure.
 I gotta go.
# GEORGE
 Listen.
Let me ask you something:
If you and Mona were ever
to dance...
how do you decide who leads?
**LOL**
I mean, do you take turns?
Do you discuss it beforehand?
How does that work?
# SUSAN
You're an idiot.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Why? That's a legitimate
sociological question.
# SUSAN
 I'll see you.
 But...
Oh, and George, by the way...
you stink. You need a bath.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
It's not me! It's the car!
**LOL**
# MONA
I didn't think I'd come.
# KRAMER
I knew you would.
# MONA
 Oh, Mona.
**LOL**
 Oh, Kramer.
# CAR WASHER
You can give it the executive
treatment. That includes...
**LOL**
complete deionization
of the entire vehicle.
Where we spray everything
with Ozium-D, let it deionize...
vacuum the spray out
with a deionizing machine.
**LOL**
Hit it with high-pressure
compressed air...
and wet-dry vac it to extract
the remaining liquids.
And we top it off with
one of our seven air fresheners.
In your case, I would recommend
the jasmine or the potpourri.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Let's do it.
**LOL**
# HAIRDRESSER
The first thing that we're gonna do...
is flush the follicles
with the five essential oils.
**LOL**
Then we put you under a vapor
machine, and then a heated cap.
Then we shampoo and shampoo...
and condition and condition.
**LOL**
Then we saturate the hair...
in diluted vinegar.
Two parts vinegar, 10 parts water.
Now, if that doesn't work...
we have one last resort.
Tomato sauce.
# ELAINE
Tomato sauce?
**LOL**
**LOL**
# JERRY
Thanks a lot.
**LOL**
Wait a minute.
It still smells.
**LOL**
# CARL
It still smells!
# JERRY
It still smells.
**LOL**
It still smells.
# GEORGE
 How could it still smell after all that?
# JERRY
 I don't know.
# GEORGE
 What are you gonna do?
# JERRY
 I'll tell you what, I'm selling that car.
# GEORGE
 You're selling the car?
# JERRY
 You don't understand...
what I'm up against.
This is a force more powerful...
than anything you can imagine.
**LOL**
Even Superman would be helpless
against this kind of stench.
**LOL**
**LOL**
And I'll take anything I can get for it.
# GEORGE
Maybe I'll buy it.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Are you crazy?
Don't you understand
what I'm saying to you?
This isn't just an odor. You need
a priest to get rid of this thing.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
 I still smell.
# JERRY
 You see?
You see what I'm saying to you?
It's a presence. It's the beast.
**LOL**
All right, let me smell you.
Kramer. Kramer!
 What's that? What's going on?
# SUSAN
 Kramer open up, I know you're there!
# JERRY
 Susan.
# SUSAN
 Kramer!
# JERRY
 What is going on?
# SUSAN
 You know what's going on?
First, he vomits on me.
**LOL**
Then he burns down
my father's cabin.
And now he's taken
Mona away from me.
# GEORGE
 He stole your girlfriend?
# SUSAN
 Yes.
She's in love with him.
**LOL**
Amazing.
# GEORGE
I drive them to lesbianism,
he brings them back.
**LOL**
Hello.
 She still there?
 No. She left.
 What is going on? What did you do?
 I don't know, I didn't do anything.
I was in the video store, and I was
practicing my golf swing, you know.
**LOL**
You know, with a broom, and...
Yeah. But she saw me take a swing,
and she told me...
**LOL**
that the club is going back too fast.
Well, we started talking.
She's a golf teacher. So I went
to a lesson, and, you know...
something happened between us.
She's a golf teacher.
I've struck gold! I've already taken
six strokes off my game.
**LOL**
# JERRY
That's the least of what
you've accomplished.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
I'm gonna have dinner with her.
Can I borrow your jacket?
 Oh, sure.
 Yeah.
Wait a minute. Kramer, Kramer.
Hold on a second, I don't get this.
This woman has never been
with a man her entire life.
# KRAMER
I'm Kramer.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Look, I know what you're
going through.
Women. Who knows what they want?
**LOL**
# SUSAN
I just don't know what
she sees in Kramer.
# GEORGE
Listen, you're beautiful. You're
intelligent. You'll meet other girls.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 You think so?
# GEORGE
 Yes, I know so.
You happen to be
a very eligible lesbian.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 You're very sweet.
# GEORGE
 Hey, I know what I'm talking about.
But I gotta be honest with you,
I gotta tell you...
ever since I saw you holding hands
with that woman...
I can't get you out of my mind.
# SUSAN
 Really?
# GEORGE
 Yeah.
You're just so hip.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 Oh, my God.
# SUSAN
 What?
# GEORGE
It's Allison. I dated her right after you.
She was obsessed with me.
# ALLISON
George?
# GEORGE
Allison. Hi.
 Oh, my God. How are you?
# ALLISON
 Good.
You know, you owe me $50.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Fifty dollars, right. Right.
I don't have it on me right now.
Allison, this is Susan. Susan, Allison.
# ALLISON
 Nice to meet you.
# SUSAN
 Nice to meet you.
# ALLISON
That's a beautiful vest.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
Thank you.
**LOL**
# KRAMER
I don't understand it. I was with her
last night at my apartment.
It was very romantic.
With that fake wood wallpaper, the
atmosphere is fabulous in there now.
It's like a ski lodge.
**LOL**
# SALESMAN
 What year did you say this was?
# JERRY
# KRAMER
 Ninety.
We're on the couch. I moved to hug
her, next she tells me she's leaving...
she's got to get up early.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 That's strange.
# SALESMAN
 How many miles you got on this?
# JERRY
# KRAMER
Twenty-three thousand.
And I was looking good too.
I had a nice new shirt on.
I'm wearing your jacket.
# JERRY
Wait a second. My jacket.
I wore that in the car. The beast.
**LOL**
 This wicked funk.
 What?
# SALESMAN
I can't sell this car.
# JERRY
This thing.
It's got to be stopped.
**LOL**
# HAIRDRESSER
 So, what do you want to do?
# ELAINE
 Sauce me.
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
# JERRY
Why do we need BO?
What is the function of it?
Everything in nature has a reason,
has a purpose, except BO.
It doesn't make any sense.
Do something good...
**LOL**
hard work, exercise,
you smell very bad.
**LOL**
This is the way the human being
is designed. You move, you stink.
**LOL**
**LOL**
Why can't our bodies help us?
Why can't sweat smell good?
It'd be a different world, wouldn't it?
Instead of putting your laundry
in the hamper, put it in a vase.
**LOL**
Go down to the drug store, pick up
some odorant and perspirant.
**LOL**
Probably have a dirty sock hanging
from the rearview mirror of your car.
**LOL**
Then on a special night,
maybe a little underwear...
coming out of your breast pocket.
**LOL**
**LOL**
