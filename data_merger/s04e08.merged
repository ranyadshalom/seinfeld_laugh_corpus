# JERRY
I don't think people think of their office
as a workplace. I think they think of it...
as a stationery
store with Danish.
**LOL**
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry...
your envelopes, your supplies...
your toilet paper, six cups of coffee,
and you go home.
**LOL**
Why do people that work in offices...
have pictures of their family
on their desk facing them?
Do they forget that they're married?
**LOL**
Do they go, "5:00. Time to hit the bars
and pick up hookers.
Hold it a second.
**LOL**
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.
I completely forgot."
**LOL**
 She hasn't told her father yet?
# GEORGE
 No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
# JERRY
 "We're"? What do you mean, "we're"?
# GEORGE
 Susan wants me to be there.
# JERRY
You're meeting the father
for the first time?
# GEORGE
 Yeah.
# JERRY
 You'll make quite an impression on him...
**LOL**
when you tell him how
you burned his cabin down.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
I didn't burn it down. Kramer did.
# JERRY
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.
The guy's nice enough to give you
a box of very fine Cuban cigars...
# GEORGE
 I know what happened.
# JERRY
 No, wait.
 Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
# GEORGE
 I know.
# JERRY
Who proceeds to burn
the man's cabin down...
with one of those
very same cigars.
It's very comical.
# GEORGE
Maybe we shouldn't
start writing today.
I got a lot on my mind.
# JERRY
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.
# GEORGE
I wonder how Susan's
father's gonna react.
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.
Come on.
# JERRY
Not even a house. It's like a cabin.
# GEORGE
We could build a cabin like that.
# JERRY
Well, maybe not us,
but two men could.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
BICs? What, did you get BICs?
# JERRY
What, you got a problem
with the pen, now?
# GEORGE
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.
# JERRY
All right, let's just get to work.
NBC pilot. Seinfeld Project.
Act 1, Scene A.
# GEORGE
So you're gonna sit there?
**LOL**
# JERRY
Let me explain to you...
one of the key elements involved
in the writing process.
Because it may seem outwardly...
that the pen and the paper
and the chair play a large role.
But they're all somewhat incidental
to the actual using of the brain.
**LOL**
Okay, so just... Just park yourself.
All right. Act 1, Scene A.
# GEORGE
 Drink?
# JERRY
 No. No drink.
# GEORGE
 All right. Here we go.
# JERRY
 Act 1, Scene A.
# GEORGE
 Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
 Yes.
**LOL**
# JERRY
Hi, is Elaine there?
Oh, hi, Sandra.
Yeah, I can hold.
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat
with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.
Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen,
I'm at a pay phone.
There's a lot of people
waiting to use it.
I'll be off in a minute!
**LOL**
Yeah, could you put me through
to Elaine?
Okay, thanks.
Are you thinking of ideas?
**LOL**
Is there any way I can
get you directly?
Every time I call, Sandra bends
my ear for, like, 20 minutes.
So we're on for later?
# ELAINE
Yeah, I'll come by after work.
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing
happening here.
**LOL**
I gotta go. I gotta go.
Sandra? Sandra?
Can you come here for a second?
# JERRY
 Okay. Let's go.
# GEORGE
 Here we go.
 You got it? Here we go.
# JERRY
 Yeah.
# GEORGE
# JERRY
Okay, how about this:
I'm in my apartment.
You come in.
# GEORGE
It's beautiful.
And what do I say?
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Could you do me a favor?
When my friends call...
could you not talk to them
for too long?
# SANDRA
Why, did Jerry say something?
# ELAINE
No. No.
# SANDRA
He must've said something.
# ELAINE
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
# SANDRA
 I can't work for you.
 Oh, God.
 I can't. I'm leaving.
# ELAINE
 No, Sandra...
**LOL**
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.
Listen, Jerry's under a lot
of pressure right now.
It's very hard being
a stand-up comedian.
Sometimes they don't laugh.
**LOL**
 All right, let's get going.
 All right, let's go to work.
# GEORGE
 Let's go.
# JERRY
 Okay.
# KRAMER
 Hey.
# GEORGE
 We're in the middle of something.
 We're trying to do a little work here.
# JERRY
 Yeah, come on.
What's with you?
# KRAMER
 No more golf.
# JERRY
 Why?
# KRAMER
Remember I told you about the pro
at the Westchester Country Club...
who's letting me play every time
I gave him those Cuban cigars?
# JERRY
 Yeah.
# KRAMER
 Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!
**LOL**
Hey, George, maybe you can
ask Susan's father for some more.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
What are you, crazy?
I can't ask the guy for more cigars
after you burned down his cabin.
# KRAMER
What's one thing got to do
with another?
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Kramer, please.
# KRAMER
Well, I can't go back
to the public courses now.
I can't. I won't.
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.
The grass has
big brown patches in it.
They don't rake the sand traps.
Not to mention the caliber of people
you have to play with.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
I can't help you. You're gonna have to
get them someplace else.
# KRAMER
Where? They're Cubans.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 You know what? I should take off.
# JERRY
 What?
# GEORGE
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house
for dinner.
I wanna shower first,
and I wanna leave plenty of time.
# JERRY
You got four hours.
What about the script?
# GEORGE
I think we got a bite on it.
**LOL**
# MRS. ROSS
Doesn't George look like
your sister Sara?
**LOL**
# MR. ROSS
A slight resemblance.
# MRS. ROSS
Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
# GEORGE
Oh, I have tremendous respect
for people who work with feet.
I mean, to dedicate yourself
to the foot...
You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean...
# MR. ROSS
How are you enjoying those cigars
I gave you?
# GEORGE
Oh, the cigars.
I'm sucking them down.
**LOL**
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
# MR. ROSS
You know, those cigars
are made special for Castro.
# GEORGE
I did not know that.
Weird. Wild.
**LOL**
# MR. ROSS
 What?
# SUSAN
 He's doing Johnny Carson, Daddy.
# MR. ROSS
I didn't care much for his jokes.
# SUSAN
 Daddy never laughs.
# GEORGE
 Oh, well, so what?
Laughter. What is that?
I mean, what is the point
of opening your mouth and going:
What is that?
**LOL**
# MR. ROSS
You know, you can't get
those cigars anywhere.
# MRS. ROSS
You and your cigars.
# MR. ROSS
Wear some more lipstick.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
Daddy, there's... There's something
that we have to talk to you about.
# MR. ROSS
Oh, I forgot to ask you:
how'd you like the cabin?
# GEORGE
Oh, the... The cabin.
Well...
**LOL**
# JERRY
After we get off the phone
you tell her?
Of course she knows it was me
who complained.
Now I'm responsible
for this woman quitting.
 Oh, this is unbelievable.
# ELAINE
 I know.
**LOL**
I screwed up. It's all my fault.
 Would you call her?
# JERRY
 Oh, dial the number.
**LOL**
How could you do this?
# ELAINE
I was just trying to help you.
# JERRY
Trying to help me.
Hello. Sandra.
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.
**LOL**
See, I told Elaine...
that it was a real treat
talking to you on the phone.
And she thought I was being sarcastic
because I'm a comedian, and all.
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a
real treat talking to her on the phone."
**LOL**
But I was really being sincere.
No, of course I like you.
Tonight?
**LOL**
Hold on a second.
 She wants to have a drink with me.
# GEORGE
 Just go. Go.
 Oh, I don't...
 Go.
Yeah, I think I can.
**LOL**
Yeah, I know where that is.
Okay. I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.
Now I gotta have a drink with her.
The cabin.
Well...
Susan?
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 About the cabin...
# MR. ROSS
 I love that place.
My father built that cabin in 1947.
My mother was recuperating
from impetigo at the time...
and Dad thought it would be a good
idea to get her out into the fresh air.
She died there the following winter.
**LOL**
And Dad passed away
10 years later to the day.
His last words to me were:
"Cherish the cabin."
**LOL**
Not, "Take care of your sister."
She's a paraplegic.
**LOL**
But, "Cherish the cabin."
And I have, for 45 years.
It's often been a sanctuary for me.
# GEORGE
Kind of like Superman's
Fortress of Solitude.
**LOL**
# MR. ROSS
What?
# GEORGE
Superman.
He built a Fortress of Solitude
up at the North Pole...
to, you know, sort of
get away from it all.
# MR. ROSS
When I go, I'm passing it on to her.
# MRS. ROSS
Well, I'll take a hotel any day.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 Daddy?
# MR. ROSS
 Yes.
# SUSAN
Daddy, about the cabin.
# MRS. ROSS
Look, Henry, I spilled wine on me.
**LOL**
# MR. ROSS
 What about it?
# SUSAN
 Well, the thing is...
# MR. ROSS
 What, what is it?
# SUSAN
 Well, the cabin is kind of...
 George?
# GEORGE
 Burned.
**LOL**
# MR. ROSS
 Burned?
# SUSAN
 There was a fire, and it...
# GEORGE
Burned.
# MR. ROSS
 The cabin burned?
# GEORGE
 Yeah, burned.
**LOL**
# MRS. ROSS
Burned?
# MR. ROSS
Was anything found?
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?
# SUSAN
 No. Nothing.
# MRS. ROSS
 Nothing?
**LOL**
# GEORGE
But, you know, Mr. Ross,
if you look at the whole situation...
what with it being your cigars
and everything...
it's really rather ironic.
One might even say,
in a sense, comical.
**LOL**
Really. Think about it.
# SANDRA
 I can't believe you said that.
# JERRY
 What?
# SANDRA
How could you say
something like that to me?
# JERRY
What? You were the one
who was talking dirty.
I was just trying to keep up.
**LOL**
# SANDRA
 That was a weird thing to say.
# JERRY
 Why? It didn't mean anything.
I was trying to join in
so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
# SANDRA
 Oh, I think you're really sick.
# JERRY
 I'm not sick.
You said much sicker things
than me.
**LOL**
# SANDRA
 I'm leaving.
# JERRY
 You're making too much of this.
# SANDRA
Excuse me.
# JERRY
 Let me walk you to a cab.
# SANDRA
 That's okay.
# JERRY
The main thing is that this is
just between us.
 And that'll be the end of it.
# SANDRA
 Oh, really?
# JERRY
I mean, people, they're not interested
in things like this.
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# JERRY
So we're drinking and talking.
And so she starts rubbing my leg.
# GEORGE
Wow, what did you do?
# JERRY
Have you ever told a woman
to stop touching your leg?
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 Yeah. Right.
# JERRY
 I know it's the wrong thing to do.
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.
I'm looking at the hand thinking,
"That hand should not be on my leg."
But I can't make my brain to get
my mouth to say the words:
"Would you mind?"
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Yet women have no problem getting
the hand off. How do they do that?
# JERRY
I don't know. They're working
on a whole other level.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 All right, so go ahead.
# JERRY
 So then we go back to my apartment.
# GEORGE
# JERRY
So we're fooling around there.
You know, it's getting
a little passionate.
And she starts with the dirty talking.
# GEORGE
All right, all right. Hold on.
**LOL**
Time out.
 What did she say?
# JERRY
 You know. The usual.
# GEORGE
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?
# JERRY
 Typical things.
# GEORGE
 What's typical? Give me typical.
# JERRY
She says...
AmericasCardroom.com brings poker back
Million Dollar Sunday Tournament every Sunday
**LOL**
**LOL**
# GEORGE
That's very dirty.
That's absolutely filthy.
**LOL**
# JERRY
And then she starts talking
about her panties.
# GEORGE
I'm gonna need some water here.
**LOL**
# JERRY
So I said something.
# GEORGE
Okay, what did you say?
# JERRY
Now, bear in mind,
I am just trying to keep up.
# GEORGE
 Of course.
# JERRY
 Okay.
So she's talking about her panties.
So...
**LOL**
So I said:
"You mean, the panties your mother
laid out for you."
**LOL**
# GEORGE
"The panties your mother
laid out for you"?
**LOL**
 What does that mean?
# JERRY
 I don't know.
It just popped out.
# GEORGE
 Well, how did she react?
# JERRY
 She flipped out. Just left.
# GEORGE
Well, that's not offensive.
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
# JERRY
Look, the main thing is I don't want
Elaine to know about any of this.
I mean, especially the pantie remark.
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.
What if this girl says something?
#  JERRY
She will. She's going back to work.
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.
So Susan's father took that news
pretty hard, huh?
# GEORGE
Yeah. He went into the bedroom
and started sobbing.
# JERRY
 Guess he didn't see the humor in it.
 Yeah.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.
# JERRY
 All right.
 Big workday.
# GEORGE
 That's right.
# GEORGE
 Okay.
# JERRY
 Let's go.
# GEORGE
# JERRY
 Right now.
# GEORGE
 Let's do it.
# JERRY
# GEORGE
 Okay.
# JERRY
# GEORGE
 All right.
 What do you got?
# JERRY
 I got, you enter, you go, "Hi."
And I go, "Hello."
**LOL**
Now, we need something here.
**LOL**
# KRAMER
 Oh, hey.
 Kramer! Hey!
 Buddy!
 You guys are working. I'll come back.
 No, no! Come on.
 No, no!
No, you guys should
get back to work.
# GEORGE
# JERRY
 Don't leave. We're taking a break.
# KRAMER
 Oh, yeah?
# JERRY
# KRAMER
George, did you talk to that guy
about getting more cigars?
# GEORGE
I told you. I'm not gonna do that.
# KRAMER
Okay. Well...
I guess I'm just gonna have to
take matters into my own hands, huh?
All right. I'll see you guys.
Where are you going?
Don't run off like that.
**LOL**
Okay...
**LOL**
# KRAMER
# SECRETARY
# KRAMER
# SECRETARY
# KRAMER
 I need to talk to someone.
# SECRETARY
 Well, what is this about?
# KRAMER
Well, it's a very private matter,
but extremely urgent.
# SECRETARY
 Are you an American?
# KRAMER
 Oh, yeah.
# SECRETARY
I see.
 Excuse me.
# KRAMER
 Okay.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 Okay, let's get going.
 Let's get focused here.
Come on, now.
Come on, let's get it together.
 Yeah?
# ELAINE
 It's Elaine.
# JERRY
Come on up.
# GEORGE
All right, you know what
we should do?
We should go to the movies.
 Get away from the script for a while.
# JERRY
 We should.
# GEORGE
I just have to go over to the Rosses'
and drop off Susan's sunglasses.
 Come with me?
# JERRY
 Yeah. Does she live with them?
# GEORGE
No, no.
# JERRY
# ELAINE
 Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld.
# JERRY
 What?
# ELAINE
I just got a message from Sandra.
She's coming back to work.
# JERRY
Well, then you've just gotta fire her.
Don't even think about it.
There's no two ways about it.
# ELAINE
 Why, what happened? Did you talk?
# JERRY
 Talk? Did I talk? I...
You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.
**LOL**
I've concluded,
from the basis the those talks...
that this isn't anybody
you should be talking to.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
# JERRY
# ELAINE
 You really think I should fire her?
# JERRY
 Oh, yeah.
In fact, if George and I weren't
so busy working, I'd do it myself.
**LOL**
# MAN
# KRAMER
# MAN
What is your name, señor?
# KRAMER
Kramer.
# MAN
So Señor Kramer,
what is this about?
# KRAMER
 Cigars.
# MAN
 Cigars?
**LOL**
# KRAMER
 Cigars.
# MAN
 What about cigars?
# KRAMER
See, here, I...
**LOL**
I saved one of the cigar rings.
# MAN
 You mean, one of these.
# KRAMER
 Yeah, yeah. That's them.
Okay, so I'd like to buy
a couple of boxes of those from you.
# MAN
You realize, of course,
these are illegal in your country.
# KRAMER
Well, illegal, huh?
# MAN
I like that jacket.
**LOL**
**LOL**
# SUSAN
 Hi!
# GEORGE
 Hi. How are you?
# SUSAN
 Hey, Jerry.
# JERRY
 Hi.
# SUSAN
I thought you guys were
working today.
# JERRY
 Just taking a little break.
# GEORGE
 Yeah.
 Oh, here's your sunglasses.
# SUSAN
 Oh, thanks. Come on in for a second.
This is my brother Ricky. He's home
from college for the weekend.
# GEORGE
Hey, there, young fella.
 What's your major?
# RICKY
 I don't have one.
# GEORGE
Well, you should always
consider podiatry.
Nothing wrong with the feet.
# SUSAN
And this is my aunt, Sara.
# SARA
He doesn't look like me.
**LOL**
# MRS. ROSS
Sara, what do you have
on your wheels?
# SARA
Nothing. They're clean.
# MRS. ROSS
Ricky, did you wipe her wheels off?
# RICKY
 Yes.
**LOL**
# MRS. ROSS
 Well, they're filthy.
It's just a matter
of common courtesy.
You come in the house,
you wipe your wheels.
**LOL**
# SUSAN
Excuse me.
Hello, Raymond.
# RAYMOND
The man from the insurance company
dropped this off.
Said it was the only thing left
from the remains of the fire.
# SUSAN
Oh, thank you.
Wow, I've never seen this before.
Oh, they're letters.
 Here.
# GEORGE
 Oh, sure.
# SUSAN
From... From John Cheever!
# JERRY AND GEORGE
# SUSAN
"Dear Henry...
last night with you was bliss.
**LOL**
I fear my...
orgasm has left me a cripple.
**LOL**
I don't know how I shall ever
get back to work.
I love you madly, John.
P.S. Loved the cabin."
**LOL**
# GEORGE
# JERRY
# GEORGE
 Well, we really should be...
# JERRY
 Yeah, look at the time.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Heading out.
You know, it's a time...
# MR. ROSS
The box!
My letters! Give me that!
Who told you to open it?
# MRS. ROSS
Who's John? Who's John?!
# SARA
 I knew it.
# MRS. ROSS
 I wanna know who John is!
**LOL**
# RICKEY
John Cheever? Dad!
You and John Cheever?
# MR. ROSS
Yes. Yes, he was the most
wonderful person I've ever known.
And I loved him deeply.
In a way you could
never understand.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
Well, we really should be
heading out.
**LOL**
# JERRY
# GEORGE
Jerry hates to miss
the coming attractions.
# JERRY
 Yeah, and because of the time.
# GEORGE
 Yeah.
Time is what he's indicating there.
**LOL**
# JERRY
# GEORGE
Anyway, onward and upward.
**LOL**
# GEORGE
 Here we go.
# JERRY
 Let's go.
# GEORGE
 Come on, now.
# JERRY
 Right now.
# GEORGE
# JERRY
 You and me. No fooling.
# GEORGE
 You got it.
# JERRY
# GEORGE
 All right, what do you got?
# JERRY
 I got, you come in, you say, "Hi."
And then I say, "Hello."
# GEORGE
 All right. So we need something.
# JERRY
 Yeah.
How about this:
I say, "How's it going?"
# GEORGE
"How's it going?" Beautiful.
**LOL**
 Come on. We were just on a roll now.
 All right.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 Did you get that line?
# GEORGE
 "How's it going?"
# JERRY
 Did you write it down?
# GEORGE
 I'm writing it. "How's it going?"
# JERRY
# ELAINE
 Real good!
# JERRY
 What?
# ELAINE
You know how much money
you cost me today? $429.
**LOL**
# JERRY
 What, how?
# ELAINE
 I got Sandra transferred...
to another office upstairs, okay.
So she blabs to Lippman about
my long-distance calls to Europe!
# JERRY
 What calls?
# ELAINE
 I made a friend when I was in Europe.
And we've been in touch,
and Sandra told Lippman!
# JERRY
Did she say anything else to you?
# ELAINE
Anything else? What do you mean,
"anything else"?
# JERRY
So she just left the office...
didn't say a word to you
about anything?
# ELAINE
 Yeah.
# JERRY
 Beautiful.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Why is that beautiful?
# JERRY
Oh, no. Not beautiful.
# ELAINE
It's $429!
# JERRY
Hey, look, I'm gonna pay for that.
# ELAINE
 No, no.
# JERRY
 No, I insist.
I was the one that encouraged you
to fire her.
 The whole thing was all my...
# ELAINE
 Okay.
# JERRY
Fault.
**LOL**
Do you smell smoke?
**LOL**
# KRAMER
Oh, hey! Hey, Jer, I want you
to meet my new friends here.
This is Luis, Jorge and Umberto.
 Hey.
# JERRY
 How you doing? Nice to meet you.
# KRAMER
Yeah, we're heading up
to Westchester. Gonna hit the links.
 Yeah.
# JERRY
 Hey, isn't that your..?
# KRAMER
Oh, yeah. Okay. We're going.
All right.
**LOL**
# ELAINE
Hey, what are you reading?
# GEORGE
The Falconer, by John Cheever.
It's really excellent.
# ELAINE
John Cheever. You ever read
any of his stuff?
# JERRY
Yeah, I'm familiar with
some of his writing. You know.
Look, we gotta get back to work.
We just had a big breakthrough.
# ELAINE
 Okay. I'll leave you two alone.
# JERRY
 Okay.
# ELAINE
Maybe I'll visit my mother.
She just bought me some new panties,
and they're all laid out for me.
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
**LOL**
