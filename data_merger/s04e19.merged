I don't belong to a health club. I have a
limit on naked men I see in one day.

Zero.

8.284
That's it.
10.147
10.219
What is with the high level of security
at health clubs, you know?
13.345
13.422
The picture IDs. Security guards.
Signing in and out.
15.854
15.925
What is this, the Kremlin?
17.686
17.760
I mean, the people with a membership
go twice a year. Who's breaking in?
22.355
23.066
Is this a big problem,
people stealing exercise?
27.193
27.271
And what if they catch the person?
What then? They run. It's aerobic.
30.465
30.541
Makes it even worse.

I last about 10 minutes
on the StairMaster.
44.179

Unless someone's stretching in front of
me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.

 Really?
49.843
# JERRY

You get up there and you stare.

 I can tell.

You know how you always brag
how you can spot a lesbian?

I'm not bragging. I happen to

I never knew you were into breasts.
Thought you were a leg man.

I don't need legs. I have legs.

113.230
Have you seen her naked
in the locker room?

 No.
116.264
# JERRY
116.264
 Then I can't accept your testimony.
117.230
117.301
Maybe if you'd seen her naked.
118.732
# ELAINE

Jerry, what am I gonna do? Go in
there and spy on her in the sauna?
130.608
# JERRY

Yes. Go in there. Do a little
investigative journalism.
134.582
134.653

Don't be so sure. Look at George.
141.121
141.193
He's on his ninth date with Betsy.
Still hasn't got anywhere.
143.989
# ELAINE
144.063
What's his problem?
145.391
# JERRY
145.464
Every time he makes a move
something screws up.
147.725
147.800
Their last date
they were on the couch...
149.697
149.769
but she was on his wrong side.
150.968
# ELAINE
150.968
 Wrong side?
152.167
# JERRY
152.238
Yeah, she was on his right side. He
can't make a move with his left hand.
155.797
155.876
Can't go left.

 He can't go left?

I mean, why'd she even
tie the towel around her?

You don't unhook anything

Go to the airlines. Tell them

my friend here,
his aunt passed away last...
652.708
# CLERK
652.776
Oh, I'm very sorry.

# KRAMER
654.512
I saw her last week. She looked
healthy and peaceful but she knew.
660.016
657.900
**LOL**
# CLERK
660.084
You poor thing.
662.311
# GEORGE
662.954
You don't think you could buy
the ticket yourself? Oh, no, okay.
666.512
666.591
 I couldn't...
668.638
668.050
**LOL**

 No, please. There, there. You sit.
670.685

I'll purchase the ticket for you.

# CLERK
673.265
You're a good friend.
674.730
# GEORGE
675.234
I understand you offer a
50-percent-off bereavement fare?
679.293
# CLERK
679.371
Yes. You have to pay the full fare now
then return to one of our counters...
684.239
684.310
with a copy of the death certificate,
and we'll refund half your fare.
688.608
688.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
690.984
The death certificate?
693.052
# CLERK
693.120
Yes, we do need documentation
or people could take advantage.
697.418
# GEORGE
697.491
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?
701.755
701.300
**LOL**
# CLERK
701.829
I know but it happens.
703.658
# GEORGE
703.731
You want my friend to ask his uncle,
a man who lost his wife of 44 years...
709.236
709.304
for a death certificate to
save a few bucks on a flight?
712.271
# CLERK
712.340
That would be $387 round trip.
715.568
# KRAMER

 You'll need my frequent flyer number.

732.696
Well, you were grabbing
onto them to save your life.
735.094

If you were drowning and
I threw you a life preserver...
737.310
737.334
you think you could tell
me if it was an inflatable?

In a terrible time like this...
904.372

who would I get the
death certificate from?

He said his name was Sal Bass.
917.754
917.828
Bass, Jerry.
919.225
919.296
Instead of salmon,
he went with bass.
922.490
921.950

He just substituted
one fish for another.
925.760

it's "Salman," not "salmon."

I was hoping to compile an...
955.924

admittedly rudimentary
scrapbook of her life.

Something that Betsy
could have and hold on to.

You dipped the chip.
You took a bite...

right in the dip.
1014.254
1014.250
**LOL**
1015.433
From now on, when you take a chip
just take one dip and end it.

# GEORGE
1024.376
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...
1027.707
