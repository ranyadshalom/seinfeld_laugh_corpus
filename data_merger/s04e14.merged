What is with the age-gap hiring
policy at most movie theaters?
4.851
4.929
They never hire anyone
between the ages of 15 and 80.
8.123
8.199
Know what I mean? The girl
that sells you the tickets, she's 10.
11.325
9.700
**LOL**
11.402
Then there's the guy that rips it,
he's 102.
14.494
14.800
**LOL**
14.572
What happened in the middle?
Couldn't find anybody?
17.004
17.074
It's like they want to show you
how life comes full circle.
20.473
20.450
**LOL**
20.744
You're 15. You're selling tickets.
Then you leave.
23.074
23.147
You go out, you have a family, kids,
marriage, career, grandchildren.
26.307
26.383
Eighty years later, you're back
at the same theater...
28.678
28.752
3 feet away, ripping tickets.
30.649
30.050
**LOL**
30.721
Took you 80 years
to move 3 feet.
33.551
36.300
**LOL**
38.896
The show's delayed? Why?
40.361
40.431
I don't know. Diane told me
to hold it for 15 minutes.
42.965
# JERRY
43.033
But I got this all timed out.
44.623
44.702
I got another spot across town at 9:50.
I'm not gonna make it.
47.771
47.838
 I hear you, guy.
48.986
48.986
 And I'm doing Letterman Monday.
50.133
50.207
You know, I gotta work out
the material.
52.400
52.476
Let me see what I can do.
54.703
56.080
Oh, no, Buckles? You're not putting
him on tonight, are you?
59.843
59.917
No. He hangs around in case
somebody drops out.
62.952
63.020
Look, why don't you come back
and do the 11:00 spot.
66.089
# JERRY
66.156
I was supposed to meet my friends
to see this movie Checkmate at 10:30.
70.215
70.561
All right, forget the movie.
I'll do the 11:00 spot. I'll be back.
74.392
74.465
 Hey, Jer.
75.698
75.698
 Hey.
76.931

# JERRY

Excuse me. Do you have a ticket?
87.543

 No.

# GEORGE
88.975
 Okay. Good.
90.339
92.100
**LOL**
92.650
You missed your spot. It was 9:15.
95.150
95.219
But, Maurice, I'm positive
you told me 9:50.
97.787
97.855
In any event, I had no alternative
but to reassign your spot...
101.550
101.625
to one of your peers who possesses
a clearer understanding...
105.627
105.696
of our scheduling policies.
108.390
107.250

 What are you doing here?
113.259
# BUCKLES
113.337
Hey, do you think this is funny?
115.166
115.506
Why do they call it "athlete's foot"?
117.506
117.574
You don't have to be
an athlete to get it.
119.505
119.576
I mean, my father gets it all the time
and, believe me, he's no athlete.
124.170
124.400
**LOL**
124.248
 I gotta go.
124.861
124.861
 Wait. Where?
125.474
125.549
 The movies.
126.531
# GEORGE
126.531
 I thought you told Kernis...
127.514
127.584
you were going back
to do the 11:00.
129.413
129.486
I'm just gonna stop by
and tell my friends I can't make it.
132.180
132.256
 Cool. I'll split a cab with you.
133.836
133.836
 I could be a while over there.
135.416
135.492
I got time. It'll give us a chance to
get to know each other a little better.
139.426
140.600

145.102
 Hey.

147.805
 Where is everybody?
148.885
148.885
 Everybody's late.
149.964
150.040
Because they know
I'll get in line early.
152.040
152.109
I've been dying to see Checkmate.
154.905
154.978
Well, if it's as good as
Ponce de León, I'll be happy.
157.808
# ELAINE
157.881
Ponce de León? Are you kidding me?
I hated that movie.
162.111
# GEORGE
162.186
Ponce de León?
But that was great.
164.686
# ELAINE
164.755
Oh, come on.
166.379
166.457
That fountain of youth scene
at the end...
168.422
168.492
where they're splashing around...
170.184
170.260
and they go running over to the
mirror to see if it really worked.
173.420
171.050
**LOL**
173.497
I mean, come on.
175.462
175.700
**LOL**
176.433
It's so stupid.
178.023
# GEORGE
178.102
Let me tell you something:
179.726
179.803
When Ponce looked in that mirror
and saw that he hadn't changed...
183.031
183.107
and that tear started to roll
down his cheek, I lost it.
187.234
187.150
**LOL**
# GEORGE & ELAINE
# GEORGE
187.311
 Oh, there you are.
188.276
188.276
 Where have you been?
189.242
189.313
Around the corner
at the Paradise Twin.
191.506
191.582
 Well, I told you the Paragon.
193.128
193.128
 No, you said Paradise.
194.674
194.752
 It's playing there too, you know.
196.418
196.418
 No. I would not have said Paradise.
198.083
198.155
That's a twin theater. I want to see
this movie on a big screen.
201.156
201.225
I'm gonna get a hot dog
at Papaya King.
203.020
203.093
 You'll never make it back in time.
204.627
# KRAMER
204.627
 I haven't had any dinner.
206.162
# ELAINE
206.230
You can get a hot dog
at the theater.
207.991
# KRAMER
208.065
I don't want a movie dog.
I want a Papaya King hot dog.
210.656

**LOL**
# ELAINE
210.734
Kramer, Jerry is gonna
be here any second.
212.768
212.836
Then this line's gonna start moving,
and we'll end up in the front row.
216.428
# KRAMER
216.507
 Just save me a seat.
217.740
217.740
 No, I don't wanna save seats.
218.973
219.042
Don't put me through that.
220.404
220.477
I once had the fleece ripped out
of my winter coat...
222.977
223.046
in a seat-saving incident.
224.704
224.150
**LOL**
224.782
 Give me my ticket, then.
226.066
226.066
 Well, I don't have them yet.
227.350
228.185
You don't have them yet?
229.752
229.820
Well, I'm in line to buy.
231.547
# ELAINE
231.622
No, George,
this is a ticket-holders' line.
234.520
# GEORGE
234.591
No, it's not.
It's the ticket-buyers' line.
236.921
# ELAINE
236.994
 Then how come we're not moving?
238.142
# KRAMER
238.142
 Good question.
239.289
239.500
**LOL**
240.597
Is this the ticket-holders' line
or the buyers'?
243.689
244.067
Holders'.
245.600
245.850
**LOL**
245.669
When I asked you before
if you had a ticket, you said no.
248.533
# MAN
248.605
I didn't. My friend was getting it.
251.469
# GEORGE
251.675
That's good.
It's good to be accurate.
254.539
253.600

Stay here. I'll go get tickets.
256.372

 Can you believe him?
257.712
# KRAMER
257.712
 He spaced out.
258.609
259.600
**LOL**
260.017
And how long would you have stood
in the ticket-holders' line?
263.018
263.487
Yeah, exactly.
264.713
264.900
**LOL**
265.689
It's sold out.
267.256
267.324
Oh, real good, George.
Real good.
270.552
270.627
Hey, I asked the guy
if he had a ticket.
272.592
272.663
 All right, what time is it?
273.913
273.913
 Twenty after 10.
275.163
275.232
They got one at the
Paradise at 10:45.
277.425
# ELAINE
277.501
No, I don't wanna go to
a miniplex multi-theater.
280.866
# GEORGE
280.938
It's the same movie.
What's the difference?
283.336
282.650
**LOL**
# ELAINE
283.407
No, it's not a theater.
284.804
284.875
It's a room where they bring in POWs
to show them propaganda films.
289.639
289.750
**LOL**
290.481
All right, I'm going.
291.912
291.982
It's in Dolby.

**LOL**
293.383
Well, what about Jerry?
295.417
295.486
You go get the tickets.
I'll wait for him.
297.451
297.521
 Terrific. All right, come on.
298.817
298.817
 All right.
300.112
304.000
**LOL**
307.764
So then, when I was 12,
the whole family moved...
310.389
310.467
from Bensonhurst
to Sheepshead Bay.
313.559
314.037
We were right on the water.
315.798
315.873
The whole atmosphere
stunk from fish.
319.306
319.376
You know that fishy smell
I'm talking about?
321.774
# BUCKLES
321.845
Yeah, yeah. The fishy smell.
323.879
323.947
To this day I won't eat fish.
325.708
325.782
 Do you eat fish?
327.578

 Yes! Yes, I eat fish!

373.360
# GEORGE
373.360
 No. I don't have any change.
374.991
# ELAINE
375.632
Well, then I'll pay you later.
377.165
# GEORGE
377.501
Or I could take the 20,
and I could pay you later.
380.092
380.250
**LOL**
# ELAINE
380.604
Yeah, you could.
382.001
# GEORGE
382.472
Might be easier.
383.903
# ELAINE
384.241
Well, how's that easier? I mean,
then you would owe me $12.50...
387.333
387.411
instead of me owing you $7.50.
389.376
389.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
390.647
 Either way.
391.994
# ELAINE

I'll buy you a popcorn and soda...

I'll wait here for them.
You go save seats.

Me? But that's three seats.
I can't save three seats.
424.880

run over to the Paragon...

and give Kramer the two tickets
so they can come in.

If you hurry back,

what are we going to do with you?
1173.992
1174.063
 I'm going away tomorrow.
1175.313
1175.250
**LOL**
1175.313
 Where? Where are you going?
1176.563
1176.632
I want to go with you.
Take me with you.
1178.461
1178.534
Well, don't be a silly goose.
1179.931
1180.002
But I've never seen Minsk. I hear
there's so much hustle and bustle.
1183.196
1183.272
You're being absurd.
Leave me alone.
1185.840
1186.142
 Rochelle, Rochelle, do you know..?
1187.921
1187.921
 Give me a break!
1189.700
1189.750
**LOL**

 Will you shut up?
1206.623
# ELAINE
1206.696
I don't know.
Does this movie stink or what?
1209.424
# JERRY
1209.499
Let's get out of here. I'll see you.
1212.090
# BUCKLES
1212.168
 You're leaving?
1212.849
# JERRY
1212.849
 Yeah.
1213.530
1213.603
Jerry, take the coat.
Please. One month.
1217.070
# JERRY
1217.140
I don't want the coat.

# BUCKLES
1220.243
Jerry, call me when you get home,
so I know you're okay.
1224.074
1224.414
 What happened to you?
1225.744
1225.744
 I missed you at the other theater.
1227.074
1227.150
Then I missed my set,
and I had nothing to do.
1229.377
1229.452
Man. Look at this.
1231.486
1231.554
I sat in gum.
1233.212
1233.150
**LOL**
1233.289
What happened to Checkmate?
1234.583
1234.657
Oh, I went out to get popcorn,
and some creep took my seat.
1238.249
1238.327
Hey, by the way,
you owe me $7.50.
1240.292
1239.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
1240.363
 But I didn't even use the ticket.
1242.113
# GEORGE
1242.113
 I still paid for it.
1243.864
1244.200
 I only have a 20.
1245.382
# ELAINE
1245.382
 Hi.
1246.564
1246.000

1246.636
 Hey!
1247.516
1247.516
 What happened to you?
1248.397
1248.471
That's my coat. Give me that.
Where did you get that?
1252.007
1251.450
**LOL**
# KRAMER
1252.074
It was on the seat.
1253.607
# ELAINE
1253.676
You took my seat?
1255.175
# GEORGE
1255.244
 You owe me $7.50.
1256.710
# KRAMER
1256.710
 Yeah. Right.
1258.177
# ELAINE
1258.748
What is this stain?
1261.476
# KRAMER
1261.551
It's yellow mustard.
Can you break a 20?
1265.246
1263.050
**LOL**
# JERRY
1265.321
But I always get confused
in the movie theater by the plot.
1269.118
1269.192
It's embarrassing to have to admit,
but I'm the one you see...
1272.989
1271.550
**LOL**
1273.062
in the parking lot, after the movie,
talking with his friends, going:
1276.620
1274.250
**LOL**
1276.699
"You mean, that was the same guy
from the beginning?"
1280.565
1282.872
Nobody will explain it to you.
In the theater, you can't find out.
1287.068
1287.143
Why did they kill that guy?
1289.438
1290.079
Why did they kill him?
1292.113
1292.982
Who was that guy?
Who was that guy?
1296.142
1296.385
I thought he was with them.
Wasn't he with them?
1299.682
1299.755
Why would they kill him
if he was with them?
1302.585
1303.893
Oh, he wasn't really with them.
1306.461
1306.050
**LOL**
1306.529
I thought he was with them.
1308.756
1309.966
It's a good thing they killed him.
