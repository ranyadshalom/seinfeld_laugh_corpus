1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:03,892
The basic problem with the
beginning of the relationship...

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:07,847
I think is that each person has
their own sexual timetable...

3
00:00:07,922 --> 00:00:11,321
of what should happen when, that
the other person knows nothing about.

4
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:14,758
That's why I think we need
some sort of sexual rule book...

5
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:16,954
where it's written down
and agreed upon...

6
00:00:17,032 --> 00:00:19,999
sexual standard dating procedure.

7
00:00:20,068 --> 00:00:22,728
Know what I mean? So if there's
any problems, you can go:

8
00:00:22,804 --> 00:00:25,896
"Look, honey, I'm sorry,
but we've been out three times...

9
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:28,440
and according to Article 7,
Section 5...

10
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:32,477
there's got to be some physical
contact, as you can see right there.

11
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,580
Otherwise,
I will report you to the board...

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,808
and they can issue a warrant
for an embrace."

13
00:00:42,223 --> 00:00:43,654
Wait a second. Wait a second.

14
00:00:43,725 --> 00:00:46,623
Then the butler says,
"I'm not cleaning it up.

15
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,923
- I'm sick of cleaning!"
- That's funny. That's funny.

16
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:52,532
"I'm sick of cleaning."
That's very funny.

17
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,665
I've never seen a pilot script
this funny.

18
00:00:54,736 --> 00:00:56,827
- Yeah, it's funny.
- How funny is this?

19
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,405
- It's funny.
- I mean, we're not stupid, right?

20
00:00:59,474 --> 00:01:02,907
- We know when something's funny.
- It cannot not be funny.

21
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:05,739
Come on, let's stay with it.
We gotta finish this today.

22
00:01:05,814 --> 00:01:08,246
Maybe I should give it
to my therapist to read.

23
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:11,283
- She's smart. I trust her.
- Maybe I'll give it to Elaine.

24
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:14,612
We haven't brought the Elaine
character into the show yet.

25
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:16,313
We should get her into this scene.

26
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:19,392
Right. Right. Okay.

27
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,189
"Elaine enters."

28
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:23,591
Right.

29
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:25,793
What does she say?

30
00:01:29,104 --> 00:01:32,196
- I don't know. What do women say?
- I don't know.

31
00:01:32,273 --> 00:01:35,604
I don't even know what they think.
That's why I'm in therapy.

32
00:01:36,111 --> 00:01:39,044
If we bring Elaine in, it'll be
so many people to keep track of.

33
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:41,546
It's too hard. I forget where
everybody is standing.

34
00:01:41,616 --> 00:01:43,741
You, me, Kramer, the butler.
It's too much.

35
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:47,115
- All right, forget Elaine.
- All right.

36
00:01:49,524 --> 00:01:50,852
- Hey.
- Hey.

37
00:01:53,495 --> 00:01:56,257
You are never gonna believe
who I just ran into today.

38
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:58,763
- Who?
- Your old flame: Gail Cunningham.

39
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,161
Did you talk to her?

40
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:03,168
Well, I was on my way to the Y,
and I saw her coming towards me.

41
00:02:03,238 --> 00:02:04,703
I didn't know what to do.

42
00:02:04,773 --> 00:02:06,807
I remember you had
three dates with her...

43
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,840
and she wouldn't
kiss you good night.

44
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,570
So now I'm thinking,
"What is my duty to my friend?

45
00:02:11,646 --> 00:02:13,839
Do I acknowledge her?
Do I ignore her?"

46
00:02:13,915 --> 00:02:16,415
- I mean, what is my responsibility?
- So, what happened?

47
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:20,315
You know, she sees me
and she goes, "Hi, Kramer!"

48
00:02:20,388 --> 00:02:22,046
Like nothing happened.

49
00:02:22,123 --> 00:02:25,852
Like she never went three dates
with you and refused to kiss you.

50
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:30,293
- Yeah, I know about the three dates.
- You know what I did? I snubbed her.

51
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:35,328
- What do you mean you snubbed her?
- I walked by her, never said a word.

52
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:38,604
- Right by her?
- Right by her.

53
00:02:38,673 --> 00:02:41,936
What do you say about a guy
like this, huh?

54
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,547
You are some great friend. I'll tell you.
Snubbed her. Not that I condone it.

55
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:50,916
I've never condoned snubbing
in my administration.

56
00:02:50,985 --> 00:02:53,110
But your loyalty is beyond question.

57
00:02:53,188 --> 00:02:55,415
Well, you know, she's lucky I was
in a good mood.

58
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:57,057
Could have been a lot worse.

59
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:03,355
- I'm not even in here.
- Yeah, I know.

60
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:06,329
I thought there was gonna be
a character named "Elaine Benes."

61
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:08,628
There were too many people
in the room.

62
00:03:08,703 --> 00:03:10,395
We couldn't keep track
of everybody:

63
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:11,903
George and the butler...

64
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:14,837
You "couldn't keep track
of everybody"?

65
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:17,842
Well, we tried. We couldn't.
We didn't know how to...

66
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:22,708
We couldn't write for a woman.
We didn't know what you would say.

67
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:25,346
Even right now,
I know you're gonna say something.

68
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,112
I have no idea what it is.

69
00:03:27,188 --> 00:03:29,518
You have no idea?

70
00:03:30,024 --> 00:03:31,819
Something derogatory?

71
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:36,293
- I thought I'd find you here.
- Well, Gail Cunningham.

72
00:03:36,364 --> 00:03:38,455
- Hi, Gail.
- Hi, Elaine.

73
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,760
- What is with your friend, Kramer?
- Why?

74
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:42,163
He snubbed me.

75
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:44,996
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

76
00:03:45,073 --> 00:03:48,370
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing. Hey, give me that.

77
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:51,706
- I thought you finished.
- I took two bites. How am I finished?

78
00:03:51,779 --> 00:03:55,508
Plus, you're coming down with
something. You want me to get sick?

79
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:56,978
Bite?

80
00:03:57,051 --> 00:03:59,016
I wanna know.
Why did Kramer do that?

81
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:02,384
I don't know. Once he leaves the
building, he's out of my jurisdiction.

82
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:05,822
- Tell him that I am mad at him.
- All right. So where you cooking now?

83
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:08,061
- Pfieffer's.
- Oh, the power-lunch crowd.

84
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:10,388
Nice shoes.

85
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:13,991
- Thank you.
- Where did you get them?

86
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:16,363
They're Botticelli's.

87
00:04:17,071 --> 00:04:21,232
Botticelli's. Look at you.
I'm afraid to go in there.

88
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:22,899
Really?

89
00:04:23,144 --> 00:04:26,213
- Would you care to join us?
- No, no. I gotta get to the restaurant.

90
00:04:26,281 --> 00:04:27,780
- See you.
- See you.

91
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:34,018
"Look at you with your Botticelli's."

92
00:04:34,622 --> 00:04:37,213
- That bothered you?
- Yes, it bothered me.

93
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,690
So I bought a pair of shoes
at Botticelli's.

94
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:41,385
I'm not allowed to shop there?

95
00:04:41,462 --> 00:04:43,496
That really embarrassed me.

96
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:47,396
- It did?
- Yes. Couldn't you see that?

97
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:49,797
No.

98
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:52,166
This is why you're not in the pilot.

99
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:59,741
Well, George, I think you're beginning
to get some perspective on things.

100
00:04:59,814 --> 00:05:01,541
I think we're making progress.

101
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:04,981
- Yeah, I feel like I've grown.
- Good. Let's pick up on this next week.

102
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,381
Great.

103
00:05:08,523 --> 00:05:12,354
By the way, did you get a chance
to read the script?

104
00:05:12,427 --> 00:05:14,791
Yes. Yes, I did.

105
00:05:14,862 --> 00:05:16,589
Well, what did you think?

106
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,664
It was...

107
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,095
good.

108
00:05:22,704 --> 00:05:24,431
You didn't like it?

109
00:05:25,073 --> 00:05:26,470
Well, no...

110
00:05:26,541 --> 00:05:30,077
I can't believe this. What was wrong
with it? What didn't you like about it?

111
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:31,302
It wasn't funny.

112
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:34,277
It wasn't funny?
What, are you kidding?

113
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:36,747
No. I didn't find it funny.

114
00:05:36,818 --> 00:05:40,615
You didn't find it funny?
This is what I'm paying for?

115
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:44,417
Well, that whole story line about a guy
who gets into a car accident...

116
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:48,221
doesn't have insurance, so the judge
sentences him to be a butler?

117
00:05:48,296 --> 00:05:49,920
I didn't really buy that.

118
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:56,037
Let me tell you who did buy it.
We pitched this story...

119
00:05:56,104 --> 00:06:01,164
to Russell Dalrymple, the president
of NBC, and he ate it up with a spoon.

120
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:03,276
If you're going to be
in a creative field...

121
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:06,072
you're gonna have to learn how
to deal with criticism.

122
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:07,714
How's this for criticism?

123
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:12,076
You stink.
How do you like that criticism?

124
00:06:12,153 --> 00:06:15,745
You know what's funny to me?
That diploma up on the wall.

125
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:18,687
That is my idea of comedy.

126
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,192
You sitting here,
telling people what to do.

127
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:24,798
- I think you'd better go.
- I'm going baby. I'm going!

128
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,831
It's Jerry's fault.

129
00:06:28,736 --> 00:06:33,296
He took out all my good lines.
He's such a control freak.

130
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:40,970
So you send me to this therapist to
help me with my emotional disorders...

131
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,310
and she criticizes our script.

132
00:06:43,384 --> 00:06:45,475
What kind of a therapist is that?

133
00:06:45,553 --> 00:06:48,178
Well, I guess she didn't
think it was funny.

134
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:52,258
Oh, she didn't think it was funny.
What is she, Rowan and Martin?

135
00:06:52,794 --> 00:06:54,794
We're supposed to meet
with NBC tomorrow.

136
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:56,793
She completely shattered
my confidence.

137
00:06:56,864 --> 00:06:59,194
And I'm paying for this.
She's my employee.

138
00:06:59,267 --> 00:07:04,304
- I thought your mother's paying for it.
- And she slaves to earn every penny...

139
00:07:04,372 --> 00:07:07,600
so that someday I might be able
to walk up to a woman and say:

140
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:11,336
"Yes, I'm bald,
but I'm still a good person."

141
00:07:11,412 --> 00:07:14,106
He's right. It's not her place
to criticize the script.

142
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:17,183
Which reminds me. What did you
think of it? You never told me

143
00:07:17,952 --> 00:07:20,316
- What did I think of it?
- Yeah.

144
00:07:21,723 --> 00:07:23,620
Hey, buddy,
I got something to tell you.

145
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:27,022
Now, one second. You won't get off
that easy. Tell me what you thought.

146
00:07:27,095 --> 00:07:29,891
- Well, you know...
- I just kissed Gail Cunningham.

147
00:07:34,202 --> 00:07:36,532
- You what?
- Yeah, I kissed her.

148
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:39,400
- You kissed her?
- Right on the mouth.

149
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:41,201
What kind of great friend are you?

150
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,240
How do you go
from snubbing to kissing?

151
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:47,211
I saw her outside the Y. She came up
to me, she started yelling...

152
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:51,078
because I snubbed her.
Then we started talking a little bit...

153
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:54,881
and I walked her to her building.
And just before I left...

154
00:07:54,956 --> 00:07:58,025
I put my arm around her waist.
I pulled her to me...

155
00:07:58,092 --> 00:08:00,251
and I planted one.

156
00:08:02,196 --> 00:08:04,958
- What did she do?
- She kissed me back.

157
00:08:05,032 --> 00:08:08,761
I don't get this. I go out with this girl
three times, she won't shake my hand.

158
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:10,995
Why is she kissing you?

159
00:08:11,072 --> 00:08:15,370
Because I snubbed her.
You see? Women, they like that.

160
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:16,976
Yes, I understand women.

161
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:20,602
The snub is good.
They love the snub.

162
00:08:21,149 --> 00:08:23,774
No they don't. I tried that once.

163
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:26,351
I snubbed for a year. Nothing.

164
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,149
Every woman I saw, I snubbed.
You never saw people so pleased.

165
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:36,161
So I understand you're buying
new shoes now at Botticelli's.

166
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:38,764
What? Who told you that?

167
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:40,662
Gail Cunningham.

168
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:44,462
I don't understand. Why is this woman
talking about my shoes?

169
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:47,665
Why are my shoes a topic
of conversation?

170
00:08:47,742 --> 00:08:50,436
We were just talking,
and she mentioned...

171
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:52,977
how you're buying your
shoes now at Botticelli's.

172
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:56,480
How I'm buying my shoes now
at Botticelli's.

173
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:58,175
Did you hear this?

174
00:08:59,854 --> 00:09:01,854
So what?

175
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:07,758
So what? She is talking about my
shoes. She is discussing my shoes.

176
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:12,263
It is nobody's business where
I buy my shoes.

177
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:24,668
- Hey, Gail?
- Yeah.

178
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:26,704
Elaine.

179
00:09:26,781 --> 00:09:28,974
- Why are you talking about my shoes?
- What?

180
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:32,119
My Botticelli shoes. You've been
talking about my Botticelli shoes.

181
00:09:32,186 --> 00:09:33,548
What are you talking about?

182
00:09:33,621 --> 00:09:37,623
Did you or did you not tell Kramer
that I got my shoes at Botticelli's?

183
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,259
Too spicy. He wants another one.

184
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:42,794
- You got that pasta primavera?
- Elaine, I am very busy here.

185
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,759
Who else have you mentioned
my shoes to?

186
00:09:44,832 --> 00:09:47,730
I want to know why my footwear
is your conversation?

187
00:09:48,135 --> 00:09:50,795
I am not discussing this.
This is insane.

188
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:52,667
You got that pasta primavera?
Let's go!

189
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:03,745
Here you are, Mr. Dalrymple.

190
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:07,817
Sorry for the delay.
Enjoy your lunch.

191
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:10,256
- Well, come in. Come in.
- Hi.

192
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:11,652
- Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:10:11,726 --> 00:10:13,293
Sorry to make you come up here...

194
00:10:13,361 --> 00:10:16,225
but I wasn't feeling well
enough to go back to the office.

195
00:10:16,297 --> 00:10:19,366
Well, it's the only chance I have
to meet with you this week.

196
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:21,262
- Are you all right?
- It's my stomach.

197
00:10:21,335 --> 00:10:24,962
There must have been something in
the pasta primavera I had for lunch.

198
00:10:25,273 --> 00:10:27,398
- Where did you eat?
- Pfeiffer's.

199
00:10:28,609 --> 00:10:31,269
- I know the chef there.
- Food is usually terrific.

200
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:33,640
My cousin worked for Bouchard's.

201
00:10:33,714 --> 00:10:36,874
They used to use the bouillabaise
for a toilet.

202
00:10:37,685 --> 00:10:39,309
What are you saying?

203
00:10:39,387 --> 00:10:41,955
Well, you didn't hear it from me,
but needless to say...

204
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,956
if you go in there,
stick with the consommé.

205
00:10:45,192 --> 00:10:47,760
We better get started.
My daughter's gonna be here soon.

206
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:49,156
Oh, you have a daughter.

207
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:52,060
- She just turned 15 last week.
- That's a fun age.

208
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,461
Yeah.

209
00:10:53,935 --> 00:10:55,263
All right.

210
00:10:56,137 --> 00:10:59,729
The script. Now, I've read
this thing three times.

211
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:01,135
Yeah?

212
00:11:02,076 --> 00:11:04,167
And every time I read it...

213
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:09,210
What?

214
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,218
- Excuse me for a second.
- What?

215
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:16,652
Would you like a Pepto-Bismol?
I keep them in my wallet.

216
00:11:17,124 --> 00:11:19,249
You think he liked it?

217
00:11:24,598 --> 00:11:26,222
I'm not sure.

218
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:39,573
- What was that dish he said...
- Pasta primavera.

219
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:43,707
You know,
"primavera" is Italian for "spring."

220
00:11:43,784 --> 00:11:46,182
- No?
- Yeah.

221
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:49,618
Really, I'm terribly sorry. It's just...

222
00:11:51,192 --> 00:11:53,089
all of a sudden, it just hit me.

223
00:11:53,961 --> 00:11:57,656
So you were saying,
about the script.

224
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,424
Right. The script.

225
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:00,964
Your script needs...

226
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:04,662
It needs...

227
00:12:05,706 --> 00:12:07,364
- More jokes?
- Another ending?

228
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,202
A different name for the butler?

229
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,681
Maybe we should go.

230
00:12:18,319 --> 00:12:20,046
We haven't heard his notes yet.

231
00:12:20,121 --> 00:12:22,519
We don't know how he feels
about our work.

232
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:30,054
Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

233
00:12:30,898 --> 00:12:35,560
I can't listen to anymore of this.
The guy's losing a lung in there.

234
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,500
Hello.

235
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,698
- Hi.
- I'm Molly.

236
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,537
- I'm Jerry.
- George.

237
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:45,736
We're discussing our script
with your father.

238
00:12:45,813 --> 00:12:47,540
He just read it.

239
00:12:49,283 --> 00:12:54,377
- Daddy, are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, sweetie, I'm fine.

240
00:12:56,824 --> 00:13:00,087
- So you live with your mother?
- Yeah.

241
00:13:00,761 --> 00:13:04,763
Divorce is very difficult,
especially on the kid

242
00:13:04,832 --> 00:13:07,730
Of course, I'm the result of my parents
having stayed together.

243
00:13:07,802 --> 00:13:09,062
So you never know.

244
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,001
Crapshoot.

245
00:13:11,072 --> 00:13:12,901
Dad, you all right?
What's the matter?

246
00:13:12,973 --> 00:13:16,099
- It's just a stomach thing.
- Yuck.

247
00:13:16,177 --> 00:13:18,211
We're gonna have to do this
some other time.

248
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,473
So if you give me your number,
I'll call you later.

249
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,419
Suddenly I'm in the mood
for pasta primavera myself.

250
00:13:37,531 --> 00:13:40,191
Get a good look, Costanza?

251
00:13:43,537 --> 00:13:47,403
- What were you doing?
- It's not my fault. You poked me.

252
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:50,840
You're supposed to just
take a peek after a poke.

253
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:53,946
You were like you just put a quarter
in one of those metal things...

254
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:55,775
on top
of the Empire State Building

255
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,475
It was cleavage.
I couldn't look away.

256
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:02,110
What, am I waiting to win an Oscar
here? This is all I have in my life.

257
00:14:02,523 --> 00:14:06,286
Looking at cleavage is like looking
at the sun. You don't stare at it.

258
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,394
It's too risky.

259
00:14:08,662 --> 00:14:11,993
- You get a sense of it, then look away.
- All right.

260
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:15,129
He caught me in a cleavage peek.
So big deal.

261
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:17,793
Who wouldn't look at cleavage?
She's got nice cleavage.

262
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:20,337
- That's why I poked.
- Why I peeked.

263
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,469
- Hi.
- Hey.

264
00:14:23,077 --> 00:14:25,737
- What is with your friend Elaine?
- What?

265
00:14:25,813 --> 00:14:29,440
She comes to my restaurant,
comes right in my kitchen...

266
00:14:29,517 --> 00:14:32,108
starts complaining
that I'm talking about her shoes.

267
00:14:32,219 --> 00:14:35,152
- She did?
- Right in the kitchen. Disgraceful.

268
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:37,381
I don't like people coming
into my kitchen.

269
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:40,755
I think she sneezed all
over someone's pasta primavera.

270
00:14:40,828 --> 00:14:44,022
Someone might have gotten sick
because of her.

271
00:14:48,636 --> 00:14:51,170
- Pasta primavera?
- Is that what she said?

272
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:57,341
Hey, she's something, huh? She's
a wild one. She's wearing me out.

273
00:14:57,411 --> 00:15:00,002
- She is?
- She's real sensual.

274
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,013
You know, with the cooking and all.

275
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:12,449
Hello?

276
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,021
Hi, Stu.

277
00:15:14,094 --> 00:15:15,957
- From NBC?
- Yeah.

278
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,927
What's going on?

279
00:15:18,165 --> 00:15:21,029
What? Really?

280
00:15:21,202 --> 00:15:23,133
Oh, my God.

281
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,497
Did he give you a reason?

282
00:15:25,773 --> 00:15:27,101
Oh, boy.

283
00:15:27,174 --> 00:15:29,868
Okay. All right. Thanks.

284
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,735
Dalrymple just canceled the pilot.

285
00:15:35,683 --> 00:15:38,217
If you hadn't gone there,
this wouldn't have happened.

286
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:41,252
I don't like people talking about
my shoes behind my back, okay?

287
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:43,219
My shoes are my business.

288
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:46,723
You two shouldn't have been looking
at some 15-year-old's cleavage.

289
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:49,886
- He poked me!
- There was cleavage in the area.

290
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,929
That's a reflex.
Cleavage, poke. Cleavage, poke.

291
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:55,900
But she was 15.

292
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:58,834
You don't consider age
in the face of cleavage.

293
00:15:58,906 --> 00:16:02,464
This occurs on a molecular level.
You can't control it.

294
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,474
We're like some kind of weird fish...

295
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:07,273
where the eyes operate
independently of the head.

296
00:16:07,348 --> 00:16:09,939
What's the difference?
What are we gonna do now?

297
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:12,551
He won't take our calls.
We can't get into his office.

298
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,382
You know what we could do?
He eats at Pfeiffer's.

299
00:16:15,456 --> 00:16:18,548
We can have Gail call us when he's
there, go there and talk to him.

300
00:16:18,626 --> 00:16:21,194
- You're on to something.
- The whole thing is so stupid.

301
00:16:21,262 --> 00:16:24,763
Like he wouldn't do the same thing
if Elaine walked by in a low-cut dress.

302
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:27,690
- Well, maybe not Elaine, but...
- No.

303
00:16:28,435 --> 00:16:30,059
- Somebody like Gail, though.
- Yeah.

304
00:16:30,137 --> 00:16:32,705
What? What do you mean Gail?

305
00:16:32,773 --> 00:16:34,272
What?

306
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:37,239
Hey, Kramer, listen,
I want you to ask Gail to do me a favor.

307
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:40,278
The next time Russell Dalrymple
comes in the restaurant...

308
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:43,746
ask her if she would call me.
- All right, I'll call her right now.

309
00:16:46,086 --> 00:16:47,551
What do you mean Gail?

310
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:51,452
You don't think I can attract attention,
put asses in the seats?

311
00:16:52,693 --> 00:16:56,559
Look, sweetheart,
you know you've got it all.

312
00:16:56,664 --> 00:16:58,425
But let's face it...

313
00:16:58,766 --> 00:17:00,595
- She said she'll do it.
- All right.

314
00:17:00,734 --> 00:17:02,233
- Great. Beautiful.
- Beautiful.

315
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:03,734
But she wants the shoes.

316
00:17:03,804 --> 00:17:06,498
- What?
- She says she wants those shoes.

317
00:17:06,573 --> 00:17:09,141
She wants my shoes?

318
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:11,072
What kind of person is this?

319
00:17:11,145 --> 00:17:14,908
- She is not getting them.
- Come on, I'll buy you another pair.

320
00:17:14,982 --> 00:17:17,710
No, these were the last pair
of these that they had.

321
00:17:17,785 --> 00:17:21,013
- I'll get you another just like it.
- But these were the only cool ones.

322
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:24,646
Don't you see how everybody likes
them and everybody talks about them?

323
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:30,157
Elaine...

324
00:17:32,199 --> 00:17:36,963
this pilot, it doesn't matter to me.
It's not me I'm concerned about...

325
00:17:37,705 --> 00:17:41,332
it's my mother. She's already been
in the hospital this year.

326
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:44,500
- Yeah, because she caught you...
- Never mind!

327
00:17:44,578 --> 00:17:47,909
Oh, come on. Wait a second.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

328
00:17:47,981 --> 00:17:50,208
How do I even know she wears
the same size?

329
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:52,852
- All right, what size are you?
- Seven and a half.

330
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,487
Bingo.

331
00:18:01,161 --> 00:18:03,195
Sauce this.

332
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:10,197
Yeah, he's here.

333
00:18:10,504 --> 00:18:14,973
Oh, and one more thing,
bring the shoes.

334
00:18:22,649 --> 00:18:26,014
Hey, will you look!

335
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:28,552
Fancy meeting you here.

336
00:18:28,622 --> 00:18:30,383
Hello.

337
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:33,890
Pasta primavera. Back on the horse.

338
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,526
It's funny, after the pilot got canceled,
we hadn't heard from you.

339
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:41,862
- We didn't hear anything.
- We were wondering what happened.

340
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:45,869
Well, it just didn't seem to be
the right project for us right now.

341
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,208
So, what were you saying?

342
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:02,087
The show. Because if it had anything
at all to do...

343
00:19:02,156 --> 00:19:04,247
with what you perceived as me...

344
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:07,427
leering at your daughter,
I really have to take issue with that.

345
00:19:07,494 --> 00:19:10,085
- I did not leer. Did I leer?
- No leer.

346
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:13,761
Excuse me.

347
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:17,199
- Are you using that ketchup?
- No.

348
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:25,640
Because if I'm looking...

349
00:19:25,712 --> 00:19:29,213
straight ahead and something
enters my field of vision...

350
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,715
that's merely a happenstance.

351
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,546
Look, under the circumstances...

352
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,315
I don't really feel that we should be
in business together.

353
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:39,549
Here's your ketchup back.

354
00:19:39,893 --> 00:19:43,895
You know, I had the hardest time
trying to get some out. I just kept...

355
00:19:43,964 --> 00:19:46,464
pounding and pounding
on the bottom of it.

356
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,158
- Do you ever have any trouble?
- No.

357
00:19:50,304 --> 00:19:53,498
Do you have a ketchup secret?

358
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:55,141
No...

359
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,169
Don't have a ketchup secret.

360
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:03,545
Because if you do have
a ketchup secret...

361
00:20:03,617 --> 00:20:07,585
I would really, really like to know
what it is.

362
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:18,788
Field of vision, huh?

363
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,728
How's everything?

364
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:24,166
- Really good.
- This pasta primavera is fabulous.

365
00:20:24,238 --> 00:20:27,535
- Very tasty.
- How did it go with that NBC guy?

366
00:20:27,608 --> 00:20:29,642
Great. Pilot is back on.

367
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,438
In fact, Elaine's going out
with him tomorrow night.

368
00:20:34,314 --> 00:20:35,847
Hey, listen, Elaine...

369
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,541
if Russell mentions anything
about the pilot...

370
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:41,244
you'll, of course,
tell him how much you liked it.

371
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:45,551
You know I happen to have the script
right here with me...

372
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,819
and on page three, for example...

373
00:20:47,895 --> 00:20:51,123
suppose the Elaine character
comes in wearing...

374
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:52,697
a low-cut dress...

375
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:57,394
and the butler is very distracted
and can't work.

376
00:20:57,671 --> 00:21:01,263
That kind of comedy,
that's a little broad for us.

377
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,843
I'm sure it's right up Russell's alley.

378
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:06,768
- Well, it's a funny idea.
- It's funny.

379
00:21:06,847 --> 00:21:08,881
- Come on, funny is funny.
- Funny's funny.

380
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:11,279
We're here to entertain, right?

381
00:21:12,119 --> 00:21:13,618
All right.

382
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,288
Well, maybe I'll mention it
to Russell tomorrow night.

383
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:18,481
- If you can.
- Yeah.

384
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:21,492
- Where is he taking you, by the way?
- Bouchard's, on 53rd.

385
00:21:27,668 --> 00:21:30,703
I think what he's trying to say is,
"Get the bouillabaise."

386
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:45,710
Men are obsessed with cleavage,
women are obsessed with shoes.

387
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:48,411
It's the same for both sexes.
It doesn't matter...

388
00:21:48,488 --> 00:21:50,988
how many times
we've seen these things.

389
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:53,718
Every time these objects
are presented to us...

390
00:21:53,794 --> 00:21:55,919
we have to look.
We cannot not look.

391
00:21:55,996 --> 00:21:58,690
To men,
cleavage is like the nearest thing...

392
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:01,595
to a nearby UFO landing.
That's what it is.

393
00:22:01,668 --> 00:22:05,534
Women, if women buy a pair
of shoes that they really love...

394
00:22:05,606 --> 00:22:08,140
this is like boarding the alien ship.

395
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:10,139
It's possible that aliens
have landed...

396
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,778
and they haven't been able
to get our attention...

397
00:22:12,846 --> 00:22:15,471
because we're so preoccupied
with cleavage and shoes.
