Loyalty to any one sports team
is pretty hard to justify...
5.264
5.339
because the players are always
changing. The team can move.
8.237
8.309
You're actually rooting for the clothes
when you get right down to it.
11.537
11.100
**LOL**
11.612
I mean, you are standing
and cheering and yelling...
14.272
14.348
for your clothes to beat
the clothes from another city.
17.815
17.500
**LOL**
17.885
Fans will be so in love
with a player...
19.748
19.820
but if he goes to another team,
they boo him.
22.889
22.957
This is the same human being
in a different shirt.
25.389
25.459
They hate him now.
26.787
26.861
Boo.
28.758
28.829
Different shirt.
30.920
29.700
**LOL**
30.998
Boo.
33.566
# JERRY
36.737
Sure you don't want the tickets?
38.270
# GEORGE
38.339
No.
39.322
# JERRY
39.322
I can't believe I'm having trouble...
40.304
40.374
getting rid of Super Bowl tickets.
42.074
# GEORGE
42.074
I'm telling you, skip the wedding.
43.773
43.844
Go to the game.
44.508
# JERRY
44.508
I can't.
45.172
45.246
The Drake put me
in the wedding party.
46.904
# GEORGE
46.981
Well, who schedules his wedding
on Super Bowl Sunday?
49.481
# JERRY
49.583
Maybe he didn't know.
50.879
# GEORGE
50.879
Let me see.
52.174
52.253
I can't believe you got these for free.
What? Row F?
55.322
# JERRY
55.389
Row F.
56.717
56.790
In front of the G's.
Hobnobbing with the D's and E's.
59.415
59.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
59.894
How about Kramer or Elaine?
61.224
# JERRY
61.224
Elaine laughed at me.
62.554
62.630
Kramer's interested
in Canadian football.
64.595
# GEORGE
64.665
Well, wish I could help you.
67.359
# JERRY
67.434
Come on, take them.
You could take Bonnie.
70.196
# GEORGE
70.271
You paying my hotel
and airfare to Miami?
72.805
# JERRY
72.873
What do you think?
73.918
# GEORGE
73.918
In order to use these...
74.964
75.042
I gotta spend, like, 1500 bucks.
76.905
76.977
This is a bill for $1500.
79.272
80.000
**LOL**
79.747
Plus, she'd ask about
the sleeping arrangements.
81.974
82.049
I find sleeping-arrangement
conversations depressing.
84.481
# JERRY
84.552
Yeah. Sleeping arrangements.
86.176
86.253
So you haven't...?
87.270
# GEORGE
87.270
Oh, no, no, no.
88.287
88.355
I haven't even seen her apartment yet.
Tomorrow night's the first night.
91.652
# JERRY
# GEORGE
91.725
Hey, hey. Is that Tim Whatley?
93.383
# JERRY
93.761
The dentist?
94.874
# GEORGE
94.874
Is he mad at you for crashing...
95.988
96.063
his Thanksgiving party?
97.358
# JERRY
97.358
No. I explained it to him.
98.654
98.732
He was fine with it.
99.465
# GEORGE
99.465
Oh, good.
100.197
# JERRY
100.267
Yeah. I blamed it on you.
102.164
102.236
Hi, Tim.
103.270
103.000
**LOL**
# TIM
103.270
Hey, Jerry.
104.304
104.371
George. What are you up to?
106.166
# JERRY
106.240
Oh, just a couple gals out on the town,
shopping and gabbing.
109.207
# GEORGE
109.276
I'm getting a makeover.
110.866
111.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
112.112
Hey, how'd you like
to go to the Super Bowl?
114.146
# TIM
114.215
What, are you kidding?
115.898
# JERRY
115.898
Here. Two tickets. Have a good time.
117.580
# TIM
118.586
How can I thank you?
I'll take you to dinner sometime.
121.177
121.255
You ever been to Mendy's?
122.721
123.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
122.721
No. No, no. No dinner.
124.188
# JERRY
125.793
Tim, you didn't have to get me
a thank-you gift.
128.794
128.862
I know. It's a label maker.
131.396
131.465
The Label Baby Junior.
134.466
134.000
**LOL**
134.735
Yeah, I hear they're good.
136.860
136.937
Well, label me thankful.
139.904
140.100
**LOL**
140.307
Okay. Well, you enjoy those tickets.
142.739
142.810
Bye-bye.
144.707
144.600
**LOL**
146.981
Yeah?
148.708

Come in.
150.782

**LOL**
# KRAMER
152.052
Hey, where can I put this?
153.483
# JERRY
153.554
What is it?
154.303
# KRAMER
154.303
It's Risk, Jerry.
155.053
155.122
The game of world conquest.
158.214
160.100
**LOL**
160.995
All right, that's perfect.
162.763
# JERRY
162.763
Kramer, why do you have to...?
164.531
165.132
Hello, Newman.
167.427
166.800
**LOL**
# NEWMAN
168.235
Hello, Jerry. Will he take it?
I gotta go to work.
170.599
# JERRY
170.671
Take what?
171.370
# KRAMER
171.370
The board, Jerry.
172.068
172.139
We've been playing at Newman's
for six hours, but he's gotta go.
175.072
# JERRY
175.142
Why not leave it at Newman's?
176.591
# NEWMAN
176.591
I wanted to. He won't let me.
178.040
# KRAMER
178.112
We have to put the board in a neutral
place where no one will tamper with it.
182.774
180.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
182.850
So that's here?
184.880
# KRAMER
184.880
Yes, yes. You're like Switzerland.
186.909
186.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
186.987
I don't wanna be Switzerland.
189.612
# KRAMER
189.690
Jerry, Newman and I are engaged in
an epic struggle for world domination.
193.726
193.794
It's winner take all.
People cannot be trusted.
197.421
# NEWMAN
197.498
Don't look at me.
199.527
# KRAMER
199.527
I'm looking right at you, big daddy.
201.557
201.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
202.736
All right, soldier boys. Let's fall out.
204.031
# KRAMER
# JERRY
204.031
Yeah.
205.327
205.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
205.406
All right, you're gonna look after it?
206.605
# JERRY
206.605
Yeah, yeah.
207.804
# KRAMER
207.875
Stay strong. Watch it good.

211.645
Hey.
212.973
213.080
Oh, is that a label maker?
214.461
# JERRY
214.461
Yes, it is. I got it as a gift.
215.842
215.916
It's a Label Baby Junior.
218.678
218.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
218.752
Love the Label Baby, baby.
220.752
221.600
**LOL**
221.255
You know, those things
make great gifts.
223.084
223.157
I just got one for Tim Whatley
for Christmas.
225.316
226.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
225.893
Tim Whatley?
227.490
# ELAINE
227.490
Yeah. Who sent you that one?
229.087
# JERRY
229.163
One Tim Whatley.
231.163
231.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
231.799
No. My Tim Whatley?
233.764
# JERRY
233.834
The same. He sent it as a thank you
for my Super Bowl tickets.
237.563
# ELAINE
237.771
I think this is the same one
I gave him.
240.101
240.174
He recycled this gift.
242.742
242.810
He's a re-gifter.
244.377
244.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
245.079
Or maybe he liked your gift so much,
he decided to get me the same thing.
249.843
249.917
Perhaps it's an homage.
251.712
251.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
252.086
Yeah, perhaps.
253.483
# JERRY
253.554
Well, how did he react
when you gave it to him?
256.316
# ELAINE
256.390
He said, "Oh, a label maker.
How about that."
261.223
# JERRY
261.295
He repeated the name of the gift?
262.812
# ELAINE
262.812
Yeah. So?
264.330
# JERRY
264.398
Well, if you repeat the name
of the gift, you can't possibly like it.
267.558
267.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
267.634
What do you mean?
268.962
# JERRY
269.036
Like when someone
opens something and goes:
271.001
271.071
"Oh, tube socks."
273.537
273.200
**LOL**
273.607
What are you gonna do?
274.488
# ELAINE
274.488
I don't know.
275.368
275.442
I guess I'll just get invited
up to his apartment...
277.908
277.978
and see if he's got a label maker.
279.644
# JERRY
279.644
Why did you get him a gift?
281.309
# ELAINE
281.382
He did some dental work for me
and didn't charge.
283.643
283.717
So I got him a Christmas present.
285.375
# JERRY
285.452
Yeah, well, if you're getting him
anything for his birthday, I'm a large.
288.783
288.700

Well, here we are.
This is the place.

You like it?
299.727
# GEORGE
299.800
I love it. This is fantastic.
302.835
302.903
Look at this couch. Is this velvet?
305.494
# BONNIE
305.572
Are you a velvet fan?
306.900
# GEORGE
306.974
A fan?
308.632
308.709
I would drape myself in velvet
if it were socially acceptable.
313.041
312.700
**LOL**
313.113
Look at this. Hardwood floors.
315.738
316.400
**LOL**
# BONNIE
317.084
Aren't they great?
Oh, Scott, hi.
319.516
319.586
This is George.
320.914
320.988
Nice to meet you.
322.101
322.101
This is Scott, my roommate.
323.215
324.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
326.593
Hey.
327.906
# BONNIE
327.906
Here. Check out this view.
329.218
329.296
If you lean out this window,
you can see the river.
332.160
334.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
336.737
So Scott's your roommate, huh?
338.270
# BONNIE
339.072
Yes. I'm sure I've mentioned him.
341.766
# GEORGE
341.842
No, I don't think
you mentioned him, no.
343.807
343.500
**LOL**
# BONNIE
344.511
He's a great guy.
You'll really like him.
346.579
# GEORGE
346.647
I'm sure I will.
348.476
348.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
350.083
Male roommate.
351.567
# GEORGE
351.567
Yes, a male roommate.
353.050
# JERRY
353.120
And this is a problem?
354.751
# GEORGE
354.751
It's a huge problem, Jerry.
356.383
356.457
The hardest part
about having sex with a woman...
358.684
358.759
is getting her to come back
to your place. He's already got that.
362.454
361.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
362.529
Well, maybe he's...
364.126
# GEORGE
364.126
No, believe me, he's not.
365.723
# JERRY
365.799
So he's an eligible receiver.
366.998
# GEORGE
366.998
Right.
368.197
368.100
**LOL**
368.268
She's confiding in him
about our dates.
370.359
370.437
You always like the person you talk to
about the date more than the date.
373.768
373.841
It's just a matter of time until they
realize, "Hey, we could have sex."
377.138
# JERRY
377.211
What's stopping them?
377.875
378.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
377.875
Exactly.
378.539
378.612
You know how they get animals
to reproduce?
380.646
380.714
They just put them
in the same cage.
383.374
383.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
384.051
What does he look like?
385.182
# GEORGE
385.182
That's the worst part.
386.312
386.386
He looks just like me.
388.477
388.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
389.323
He looks like you,
and he's working from the inside?
391.755
# GEORGE
391.825
I look like me,
and I'm working from the outside.
394.052
394.127
Who is in the better position?
395.690
# JERRY
395.690
Not you.
397.253
397.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
397.331
This bizarre
Harrad Experiment must end.
399.365
# JERRY
399.433
We'll take our check, please.
401.194
401.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
401.835
I gotta find a way to work this out.
I love that apartment.
404.665
404.738
It's so cozy.
I'm ensconced in velvet.
407.272
408.200
**LOL**
409.109
If it was socially acceptable...
410.091
# JERRY
410.091
I know.
411.074
411.144
You would drape yourself
in velvet.
414.270
413.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
414.348
I've said that before?
415.194
# JERRY
415.194
Many times.
416.040
416.116
You love velvet.
You wanna live in velvet.
418.184
418.252
Everything with the velvet.
420.286

Hey.

Guess what.
423.984
# KRAMER
424.057
I saw Newman talking to the super.
425.472
# JERRY
425.472
So what?
426.887
# KRAMER
426.960
The super has keys
to your apartment.
429.392
430.000
**LOL**
429.463
Don't you see what's going on?
431.053
431.131
Newman is planning
a sneak attack.
433.893
434.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
433.967
Oh, maybe he's got no hot water.
435.728
# KRAMER
435.802
Yeah. All right, fine.
You sit there and you watch...
438.336
438.405
while Newman takes over the world,
but he'd be a horrible leader.
441.804
440.900
**LOL**
441.875
And you know who's gonna suffer?
The little people.
444.273
444.344
You and George.
445.877
# JERRY
445.946
Are you through?
447.378
446.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
447.378
All right. Fine.
448.810
449.516
I talked to Arthur Jobania.
451.106
451.184
The Drake's wedding. That's off.
452.531
# JERRY
452.531
The wedding is off?
453.878
453.954
What happened?
454.687
# KRAMER
454.687
The Drake...
455.419
455.489
he found out that the wedding
is on the same day as the Super Bowl.
459.320
458.800
**LOL**
459.393
So he wanted to postpone it.
460.858
460.928
They got in a big argument
and... it's over.
465.192
465.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
468.635
The wedding is off.
You can go to the Super Bowl.
470.930
# JERRY
471.004
I can't call Tim
and ask for the tickets back.
473.299
# GEORGE
473.373
You just gave them to him
two days ago.
475.634
475.709
He's gotta give you a grace period.
477.606
# JERRY
477.678
Are you even vaguely familiar
with the concept of giving?
481.976
482.000
**LOL**
482.215
There's no grace period.
484.442
# GEORGE
486.219
Well, didn't he re-gift
the label maker?
488.287
# JERRY
488.355
Possibly.
489.588
# GEORGE
489.588
Well, if he can re-gift...
490.821

All right, I'll call him.
499.414

Yeah.
500.397

What's that?
501.399
# JERRY
501.399
Oh, it's Risk.
502.330
502.402
It's a game of world domination...
504.231
504.304
being played by two guys
who can barely run their own lives.
507.271
507.600
**LOL**
510.344
Hello, Tim?
Yeah, hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld.
512.503
512.579
Hey, remember
those tickets I gave you?
514.374
514.448
Well, it turns out I can use them.
516.778
516.850
Oh, you do? I understand.
519.248
519.319
Okay. Bye.
521.250
521.321
He already made plans.
He can't change them.
523.355
# GEORGE
523.423
Well, they're his tickets.
524.751
524.825
He can do what he wants with them.
526.138
525.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
526.138
Thanks.
527.450
# GEORGE
527.527
I'm heading over to Bonnie's.
528.908
# JERRY
528.908
What about the roommate?
530.289
# GEORGE
530.364
I gotta try and figure out a way
to switch places with him.
533.058
533.133
It's like a Siegfried & Roy trick.
536.066
535.700

The pickle breath is a good start.

546.443
# JERRY
546.513
What do you want?
548.547
# NEWMAN
548.615
Nothing.
550.342
551.200
**LOL**
552.119
Just being neighborly.
554.312
554.488
You wanna hang out?
Shoot the breeze?
556.488
# JERRY
556.556
I won't let you cheat.
You're not getting near that board.
559.284
# NEWMAN
559.359
Jerry, I'm a little insulted.
561.586
# JERRY
561.662
You're not
a little anything, Newman.
564.287
563.600
**LOL**
564.364
So just pack it up
and move it out of here.
566.455
566.533
All right.
568.396
# NEWMAN
568.468
Oh, by the way, what are you doing
for the Super Bowl?
571.002
569.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
571.071
I don't know.
Watch it on TV, I guess. Why?
573.537
# NEWMAN
573.607
If you watch closely,
you just might see me.
575.641
575.709
I'll be the one waving to the camera
from my seat on the 40-yard line.
578.972
# JERRY
579.046
You're going to the Super Bowl?
579.927
# NEWMAN
579.927
Yes.
580.807
580.881
A guy on my mail route got
a couple tickets and offered me one.
583.779
# JERRY
583.850
What's his name?
584.747
# NEWMAN
584.747
Tim Whatley.
585.645

**LOL**
# JERRY
585.719
That's my ticket.
587.184
# NEWMAN
587.254
Is it?
589.254
589.623
Well, if only you'd known...
590.951
591.024
you could have saved some time
and given it directly to me.
595.254
# JERRY
597.731
Newman.
599.526
599.000
**LOL**

He's really great, isn't he?
609.902
# BONNIE
609.976
Yes, he is.
611.494
# GEORGE
611.494
Yes, he is.
613.011
612.800
**LOL**
614.047
Let me ask you something.
616.172
617.117
When you come out of the shower
and put your robe on...
619.651
619.720
do you cinch it tight?
Are you concerned about that?
622.311
# BONNIE
622.389
George.
624.684
624.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
624.758
Do you hold the neck together...
626.291
626.359
or are you just letting it flap
in the breeze?
629.451
628.900
**LOL**
# BONNIE
630.030
George, you're being ridiculous.
632.724
# GEORGE
634.868
What's the massage situation?
637.528
637.100
**LOL**
# BONNIE
637.738
What do you mean?
639.170
# GEORGE
639.170
Is there any work being done?
640.602
640.674
Is there any rubbing, touching, finger
manipulation on the other person?
644.710
644.778
And if so,
who is making the request?
647.540
647.800
**LOL**
# BONNIE
647.614
George, would you just stop.
651.480
# GEORGE
653.353
Say you go into the bathroom
at 2:00 in the morning.
656.684
656.000
**LOL**
656.823
What's the outfit? I mean, are you
dressing up, or is it come as you are?

**LOL**
# BONNIE
661.061
George, what is wrong with you?
662.658
# GEORGE
662.658
I'll tell you what's wrong.
664.255
664.900
**LOL**
664.331
A grown woman
with a male roommate.
666.763
666.833
It's unnatural. It's an abomination.
669.800
# SCOTT
670.871
Hey.

How you doing?
673.067
# GEORGE
673.067
I'm good.
673.862
# SCOTT
673.940
Do you need the bathroom?
I'm gonna jump in the shower.
676.474
# BONNIE
676.543
No. Just throw my bras
out of the way.

So...
693.517

I guess I'll talk to you.
696.321
# ELAINE
696.396
Aren't you gonna
invite me upstairs?
698.794
# TIM
698.865
Upstairs? You wanna go upstairs?
701.058
# ELAINE
701.134
I would love to go upstairs.
703.498
# TIM
705.806
Elaine, you are something else.
708.466
708.542
No one could ever
put a label on you, huh?
710.507
# ELAINE
710.577
We'll see.
712.076

**LOL**
# JERRY

Newman. He's going with Newman.

**LOL**
# GEORGE
718.218
How does Tim Whatley
even know Newman?
720.081
# JERRY
720.153
Newman's his mailman.
721.743
# GEORGE
721.822
Who goes to the Super Bowl
with their mailman?
724.652
# JERRY
724.724
Who goes anywhere with Newman?
727.258
727.000

Well, he's merry.

He is merry. I'll give him that.
733.964
734.034
What's this plant for?
735.601
734.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
735.669
Oh, I had a little tiff with Bonnie
about the roommate.
738.761

Well, the cactus
will smooth things over.

I'm going to the Super Bowl
with Tim Whatley.
747.610
747.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
747.681
What?
748.476
# ELAINE
748.476
We went out for coffee...
749.271
749.349
and he offered me a ticket.
750.816
# JERRY
750.816
But what about the label maker?
752.282
# ELAINE
753.453
Well.
755.145
754.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
755.222
Wait a minute. That's my ticket.
You didn't wanna go.
757.756
# ELAINE
757.824
It was totally out of the blue.
759.289
759.359
We went upstairs to his apartment
to look for the label maker...
762.292
# JERRY
762.362
How? Did you say
you had to use the bathroom?
764.726
# ELAINE
764.798
No.
766.213
# JERRY
766.213
Then how did you get up there?
767.628
# ELAINE
767.701
I said, "Do you wanna go upstairs?"
769.281
# GEORGE
769.281
And there's your ticket.
770.861
770.937
Well.
771.817
772.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
771.817
What?
772.698
# JERRY
772.772
That's why you're going
to the Super Bowl.
775.136
# ELAINE
775.208
Why?
776.890
# JERRY
776.890
You go out with a guy one time.
778.573
778.645
You ask him to go upstairs
like you're Mae West.
782.374
782.200
**LOL**
782.449
Of course he's gonna try
and get you alone for the weekend.
785.143
# ELAINE
785.218
You mean just because
I asked him to go upstairs...
787.582
787.654
he thinks he's going downtown?
789.433
789.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
789.433
Obviously.
791.212
# ELAINE
791.658
You're crazy.
792.942
# GEORGE
792.942
Well, what happened upstairs?
794.226
# ELAINE
794.294
As soon as we walked in...
795.691
795.762
he got a call from one of his patients
with an impacted molar...
798.831
798.899
so he had to leave.
I didn't look for the label maker.
801.559
# JERRY
801.635
I don't trust this guy.
I think he re-gifted...
803.999
804.070
and then de-gifted.
Now he's using an upstairs invite...
806.832
806.907
as a springboard
to a Super Bowl sex romp.

Oh, the Ambassador.
871.062
# ELAINE
873.506
Big room?
875.005

875.075
It's a regular room,
but it's right downtown.

# ELAINE
878.878
Downtown?

880.345
Right downtown.

A couple of beds?

No...
893.522

So she kicked him out
of the apartment?

That's right.

It's just me and her.

No, it's not.
941.034

You unwittingly made
a major commitment.

945.712
Oh, my God.

You're buried.

Too bad about that

981.681
don't suddenly
get lost in the mail...
984.511

Hey, wait a minute!

Hey!
1049.943
1050.016
So I guess I'll see you at the game.
1051.363
# JERRY
1051.363
Yeah, see you there.
1052.710
1052.785
Okay. Good.

Hi, George.

# GEORGE
1062.128
Where...?
1063.456
1063.530
What happened? Where's...?
Where's all the stuff?
1066.622
# BONNIE
1066.699
It's gone. It was all his.
1068.790
1069.769
Is this a label maker?
1071.302
# GEORGE
1071.371
But the table, the stereo, the VCR...
The velvet couch. Where's the velvet?
1076.807
1076.700
**LOL**
# BONNIE
1076.876
They were his.
1078.534
1078.611
Besides, we don't need
any of those things.
1082.238
1082.315
We have each other.

Are you sure you know
where the impound yard is?

Oh, stop stalling. Come on.
1094.058
1094.500
**LOL**
# NEWMAN
1094.127
I... I can't think.
There's all this noise.
1097.321
# KRAMER
1097.397
Or is it because I've built
a stronghold around Greenland...
1100.933
1101.400
**LOL**
1101.000
I've driven you out
of Western Europe...
1103.660
1103.736
and I've left you teetering
on the brink of complete annihilation?
1107.795
1108.300
**LOL**
# NEWMAN
1107.874
I'm not beaten yet.
I still have armies in the Ukraine.
1111.205
# KRAMER
1111.277
Yeah? The Ukraine.
1113.868
1113.947
You know what the Ukraine is?
It's a sitting duck.
1116.914
1116.983
A road apple, Newman.
1118.914
1118.800
**LOL**
1118.985
The Ukraine is weak.
1120.916
1120.987
It's feeble.
1122.577
1122.655
I think it's time
to put the hurt on the Ukraine.
1125.553
1125.800
**LOL**
# UKRAINIAN
1125.625
I come from Ukraine.
You not say Ukraine weak.
1129.058
# KRAMER

Yeah, we're playing
a game here, pal.

I take your little board and smash!

1143.989
Don't worry, Tim.
1144.870
1144.944
I didn't come by to yell at you.
I didn't come by for that.
1147.740
1147.814
I just came by
to pick up my label maker.
1152.044
1152.600
**LOL**
1152.118
I gave you a label maker,
and now I would like to have it back.
1156.177
# TIM
1156.256
But you gave it to me.
1157.414
# ELAINE
1157.490
But you gave me a ticket
to the Super Bowl.
1160.559
1160.600
**LOL**
1160.627
Hand it over, Whatley.
1162.752
# TIM
1163.429
Okay.
1164.757
# ELAINE
1166.132
You don't have the label maker,
do you?
1168.393
# TIM
1169.202
No.
1170.117
# ELAINE
1170.117
I knew it.
1171.031
1171.104
You're a re-gifter.
1172.621
1172.900
**LOL**
# TIM
1172.621
Oh, yeah. Some gift.
1174.139
1174.207
That thing didn't work at all.
1175.224
# ELAINE
1175.224
What?
1176.241
# TIM
1176.309
You put a label on something,
10 minutes later it would peel off.
1179.344
1179.412
It was the worst gift I ever got.
1182.481
1182.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1184.617
Well, I bought it for you...
1187.481
1188.054
because you were so nice to me for
not charging me for the dental work.
1191.783
1194.294
The way you worked on my filling,
you were so...
1197.158
1197.230
So gentle and so caring
and so sensitive.

Do you at least have some towels
we could sit on?

It's, like, a four-hour game.

George, Scott's gonna drop by.
He said he never got his boxes.

First Kramer almost beats me at Risk,
but I narrowly escape...
1337.564
1337.637
and then Tim Whatley
gives me this Super Bowl ticket.

Then, just as I'm about to go...

these boxes show up
at the post office with no labels.
