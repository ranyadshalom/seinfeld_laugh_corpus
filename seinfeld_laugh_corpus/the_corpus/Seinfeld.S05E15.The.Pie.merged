Aren't mannequins kind of an insult
to your imagination?

You couldn't visualize a sweater...
6.530

**LOL**

When they're finished
they become crash-test dummies.

He's got a bull's-eye

Mannequins are only used
for car accidents and fashion...
24.888
22.100
**LOL**
24.992
two situations that it's impossible
for us to imagine ourselves:
28.528
28.596
Well-dressed or getting killed.
30.527
30.200
**LOL**
30.932
I'm sure some
pro-mannequin organization...
32.966
33.034
doesn't like
the term "mannequin."

Did she say why?
95.608
# JERRY
95.608
No.

She just kept shaking
her head like this:
98.825
99.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
100.701
Maybe she's diabetic.
101.416

She carries Entenmanns doughnuts
in her purse.

Maybe you said something
that offended her.

They never try.

It's a sickness.

Get out!
177.659
# KRAMER
177.659
It's uncanny!

182.078
179.400

182.149
screwed you all back together,
and stuck you on a pedestal.

So she thought I did it
to get back at her.
729.194
# GEORGE
729.263
Why didn't you just tell her?
730.660
# JERRY
730.731
It's not the kind of thing
you wanna hear about your father.
733.732
734.400
**LOL**
734.167
When he came out of that bathroom,
and he was kneading that dough...
737.862
738.238
it was a wild scene.
740.363
740.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
741.542
How could he not have washed?
743.303
# JERRY
743.410
Even if you're not gonna soap up...
745.501
745.812
at least pretend, for my benefit.
Turn the water on. Do something.
749.678
# GEORGE
750.417
Yeah, just like I do.
752.417
753.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
756.023
You know, a chef who doesn't wash
is like a cop who steals.
758.819
758.892
It's a cry for help.
He wants to get caught.
761.426
# GEORGE
761.495
I think Poppie's got some problems.
763.358
763.430
There's a whole other thing
going on with Poppie.
766.090
766.700
**LOL**
767.267
So how did you leave it?
768.562
# JERRY

Hey. Hey, George.
I'm not gonna need this anymore.

780.781
You guys ought to see the way
she works her nails across my back.
784.442
786.200
**LOL**
786.386
She's a maestro... The crisscross...
789.046
789.122
the figure eight,
strumming the old banjo...
792.385
791.000
**LOL**
792.459
and this wild, savage free-for-all...
795.551

**LOL**
# GEORGE

she was naked.

829.500
**LOL**
829.162
This doesn't belong here.
831.423

Someone has made
a terrible mistake.
834.596
# BOB
834.701
You bastard!
837.031
837.800
**LOL**
838.238
You hid the suit.
839.687
# GEORGE
839.687
Hid?
841.136
841.241
I have no idea
how this suit got misplaced.
844.333
844.611
Nevertheless, I do believe
I shall purchase it.
847.305
# BOB
847.381
I hope you rot in that suit.
849.779
848.300
**LOL**
849.850
I'll get you for this. I don't know how,
but I'm gonna get you.
853.181
851.700
**LOL**
853.253
You are gonna pay.
854.850
# GEORGE
854.850
Oh, I'll pay.
856.447
856.556
Half-price.

Arrivederci, my fellow 40-short.
862.520

**LOL**
# ELAINE
864.564
I made a list of people who might
have made the mannequin.
868.498
868.602
You know, possible suspects.
870.761
# JERRY
870.871
Yeah, all right. Go ahead.
872.070
# ELAINE
872.070
Okay.
873.269
874.307
All right, well, there's this blind guy
at a party I was at...
877.604
877.678
and he felt my face
for a really long time...
880.770
881.100
**LOL**
880.847
to see what I looked like.
882.744
882.816
He almost put
his finger up my nose.
885.384
885.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
885.452
What else you got?
886.651
# ELAINE
886.651
Okay.
887.850
887.921
I won't tell you the rest of the list.
889.750
# JERRY
889.823
Because I didn't think
the blind guy did it?
891.788
# ELAINE
891.858
Because you have an attitude.
893.687
894.100
**LOL**
898.165
Oh, Georgie.
900.096
899.900

**LOL**
908.900
**LOL**
910.377
So, what do you think?
911.876
# JERRY
912.446
Did you hear something?
913.645
# ELAINE
913.645
Yeah, like a swoosh.
914.844
# JERRY
914.915
Yeah.
916.346
# ELAINE
917.718
It must be the fabric.
920.150
920.253
It's rubbing between your thighs
when you walk.
923.720
923.500
**LOL**
923.824
That's what's making
that swooshy sound.
926.620
932.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
934.201
I didn't hear it on the way over
because of the street noise.
937.759
939.500
**LOL**
941.508
This is no good!
942.836
942.909
I gotta meet these guys
from MacKenzie for lunch!
945.443
# JERRY
945.779
So what? What would they care?
947.506
# GEORGE
947.581
This MacKenzie guy,
he's a bit of a nut.
949.842
949.400
**LOL**
949.916
He fired the last guy because
his nose whistled when he breathed.
954.282
954.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
954.354
So you're not gonna get the job
because your pants make noise?
957.218
# GEORGE
957.290
Let's say it's between me
and one other guy.
959.551
959.626
He's got a quiet suit,
and I'm whooshing all over the place!
962.524
962.100
**LOL**
962.596
Who do you think he's gonna hire?
964.527
# JERRY
964.598
All these interviews
are making you nuts.

# KRAMER
970.951
Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.
972.366
# JERRY
973.907
Was it apple?
975.157
# KRAMER
975.157
What else?
976.407

No. You take that mannequin
down right now...
1022.312
1022.455
or I am pressing charges.
Yes. This is my attorney.
1025.888
# SALESWOMAN
1025.959
Yeah? What law am I breaking?
1028.152
# JERRY
1028.562
I believe there is some
legal precedent...
1030.630
# ELAINE
# JERRY
1030.730
Winchell v. Mahoney.
The Charlie McCarthy hearings.
1035.096

Are you taking this down?
1036.833

1040.869
# ELAINE
1040.974
Just get the car.
1042.088
# JERRY
1042.088
As your legal counsel...
1043.201
1043.276
I must advise against this.
1045.571

**LOL**
# JERRY

I don't know about you, but I'm getting
a hankering for some Doublemint gum.

Thanks for meeting me
down here, George.
1067.099

1072.400
**LOL**

Did you hear something?
1075.969

# MACKENZIE
1079.913
That's strange.
1081.810
1082.048
It's quieter down here.
1083.809
1083.917
We can concentrate without
people whooshing around.
1086.918
1089.923
That sound again.
1091.388
1092.959
Sure you didn't hear anything?
1095.084
# GEORGE
1095.195
No, can't say as I did.
1097.263
1097.500
**LOL**

1098.798
Kind of like a...
1100.525
1100.600

1102.402
Could be the leaves.

What pie?
1120.617

The apple pie...

Pretty good, wasn't it?

1147.147
What do they want from Poppie?

Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.
1151.846
1153.800
**LOL**
# MACKENZIE
1157.624
You thought I'd care
about your pants whooshing?
1161.524
# GEORGE
1162.262
I heard the last guy got fired
because his nose whistled.
1165.889
# MACKENZIE
1166.099
No. He got fired because
he wasn't a team player.
1170.158
1170.270
That's something we don't joke
about at MacKenzie.
1172.565
1172.639
We're a team here.
We don't tolerate dissent.
1175.902
1176.042
You wanna go your own way,
you're in the wrong place.
1178.667
# GEORGE
1179.579
No problem there.

So you didn't get the job?
1221.018
# GEORGE
1221.018
No.
1222.183
1222.455
But I was the only one at the table
that didn't get violently ill.

# JERRY
1226.960
Kramer, you can't keep
avoiding her like this.

1230.293
# KRAMER
1230.293
What?
1231.225
# JERRY
1231.297
Tell her you lost your itch.
1232.564
# GEORGE
1232.564
What happened to it?
1233.831
# KRAMER
1233.900
I lost it two days ago.
1235.900
1235.969
I've been faking it
so I wouldn't hurt her feelings.
1238.799
1238.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
1238.872
You should tell her.
1240.701

I'll let her down easy.

1244.044
All right.

Well. Hi, Olive.
1249.747

No, no. No more of that.
