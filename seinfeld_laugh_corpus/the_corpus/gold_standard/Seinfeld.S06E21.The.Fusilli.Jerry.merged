The worst part about
a car breaking down...
3.100
3.377
is when you're out
on the road, you're a guy.
5.588
5.613
Because now you have to get out and
pretend like you know what you're doing.
10.236
9.600
**LOL**
10.311
You gotta go, "All right, honey,
I'm gonna go check it out."
15.610
15.800
**LOL**
16.250
Walk around the front,
open up the hood.
18.215
18.586
That's good, it obscures her view.
20.244
20.321
That's the main reason
you want to do that.
22.685
21.700
**LOL**
22.757
You're looking in there, hoping you're
going to see something in there...
26.224
26.294
so simple, so obvious,
so incredibly easy to fix...
30.057
30.131
even you can handle it.
31.630
31.699
Like a giant on/off switch turned off.
34.825
34.500
**LOL**
38.606
So you're going out
with David Puddy.
40.765
# ELAINE
40.842
Yeah. What, is that a problem?
42.671
# JERRY
42.743
I think he could've asked me.
He's supposed to be a friend mine.
45.812
# ELAINE
45.880
I guess he figured you wouldn't care.
It has been a few years.
49.438
# JERRY
49.517
Elaine, you always care
who an ex-girlfriend dates.
52.484
52.553
You don't want someone
you know...
54.120
54.188
and you don't want
someone better than you.
56.279
56.357
Now, even though the latter
is obviously impossible...
58.857
# ELAINE
58.926
Oh, God.
60.222
59.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
60.222
The former still applies.
61.517
61.596
I don't know, I just can't see you
with a mechanic.
64.096
# ELAINE
64.165
Oh, yeah, right, right.
65.630
65.700
All those mechanics do
is work all day with their hands...
68.598
68.669
and their big muscular arms...
70.259
70.338
on machines,
and then they come home...
72.269
72.340
dripping with animal sexuality
like Stanley Kowalski.
75.898
75.900
**LOL**
75.977
What a huge turnoff that is.
77.409
# JERRY
77.409
All right.
78.841
78.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
83.050
Hey, look at that.
They got lobster on the menu.
85.846
85.920
Who would order a lobster here?
88.079
88.155
I mean, do they bring a lobster in
every day hoping, "Today's the day."
92.885
92.800
**LOL**
# ESTELLE
93.561
So what if they have a lobster?
95.686
95.763
Suddenly you're
a shellfish connoisseur?
98.832
97.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
99.300
I think we really need to be
in front of a television set.
102.392
102.470
You take TV out of this relationship,
it is just torture.
106.768
106.900
**LOL**
# ESTELLE
108.276
So I'm getting an eye job.
111.937
# GEORGE
112.146
An eye job?
Ma, you don't need an eye job.
114.510
# ESTELLE
114.582
Georgie, I'm a divorcֳ©e.
116.066
# GEORGE
116.066
You're not a divorcֳ©e.
117.549
117.618
You're just separated.
You're a "separatֳ©e."
120.516
# ESTELLE
120.588
Well, I'm out there, George.
121.787
121.200

You're not out there.
122.986

I am too.
124.136
# GEORGE
124.136
You're not out there.
125.216
125.293
You can't be,
because I am out there.
126.985
127.061
And if I see you out there...
128.458
128.529
there's not enough voltage
in this world...
130.654
130.731
to electroshock me
back into coherence.
133.823
133.400
**LOL**
# ESTELLE
135.469
Well, anyway, the operation
is on Tuesday...
138.094
138.172
and I need you to drive me home
because I'll be all drugged up.
142.606
# GEORGE
142.777
Tuesday? I can't do Tuesday.
Steinbrenner needs me...
145.209
# ESTELLE
145.279
This is the only time the doctor had.
148.109
# GEORGE
148.182

149.631
# KRAMER
# GEORGE
# KRAMER
149.631
I gotta go somewhere.
151.080
# GEORGE
151.152
No, you're gonna sit down,
you son of a gun.
153.584
# KRAMER
153.654
All right, I'm sitting down.
155.847
154.900
**LOL**
155.923
How are you?
157.752
# ESTELLE
158.059
So, Kramer, I'm getting an eye job.
162.653
# KRAMER
162.730
Yeah, good for you.
164.161
164.231
You have to look your best.
You're out there now.
166.458
# GEORGE
166.534
She's not out there.
168.568
168.000
**LOL**
# KRAMER
169.303
So who's your doctor?
171.002
# ESTELLE
171.002
Bakersaul.
172.702
# KRAMER
172.907
He's good. He's very good.
175.271
175.343
He worked on this kid
from Guatemala with no nose...
178.412
178.479
turned him into
Ricardo Montalban.
180.638
181.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
180.715
Hey, Kramer, what are
you doing Tuesday?
182.840
# KRAMER
182.917
Tuesday?
184.644
185.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
185.152
Why doesn't he pick you up
after the operation?
187.311
187.388
He's got the car
with the seats you like.
189.319
# ESTELLE
189.390
I don't care.
190.139
# KRAMER
190.139
Yeah, I know.
190.889
190.958
But I can't drive anybody anywhere
until I go down to get my new plates.
194.653
# GEORGE
194.729
Well, giddyup.
196.024
# KRAMER
196.024
All right.
197.320

217.685
Thanks.
219.082
224.100

224.592
No, these don't belong to me.
I'm not the Assman.

284.081
# JERRY
284.081
Yeah, so?
285.945
# ELAINE
286.020
He did the move.
288.020
288.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
289.657
What move?
292.307
# ELAINE
292.307
You know, the move.
294.956
295.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
295.029
Wait a second, my move?
296.892
# JERRY
296.964
David Puddy used my move?
298.793
# ELAINE
298.866
Yes, Yes.
299.945
# JERRY
299.945
Are you sure?
301.025
# ELAINE
301.102
Jerry, there is no confusing
that move with any other move.
305.263
# JERRY
305.606
I can't believe it. He stole my move.
308.766
309.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
308.943
What else did you tell him?
310.601
310.800
**LOL**
310.678
The two of you must have had
quite a little chat.
312.939
# JERRY
313.013
Oh, it wasn't like that.
I didn't even mention you.
316.480
316.550
We were in the garage.
You know how garages are.
319.414
318.200
**LOL**
319.487
They're conducive to sex talk.
It's a high-testosterone area.
324.149
324.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
324.225
Because of all the pistons
and the lube jobs?
326.725
# JERRY
326.794
Well, I'm going to that garage
to tell him to stop doing it.
329.556
# ELAINE
329.630
Well, wait... Wait a second.
331.193
# JERRY
331.193
What?
332.756
# ELAINE
332.833
Isn't that a little rash?
335.902
# JERRY
335.970
No, he stole my move.
338.436
337.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
340.241
Yeah, but I like the move.
344.004
344.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
344.745
Yeah, but it's like another comedian
stealing my material.
347.780
# ELAINE
347.848
He doesn't even do it
exactly the same.
350.041
350.117
He uses a pinch at the end
instead of the swirl.
354.313
355.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
354.822
Oh, yeah, the pinch.
I've done the pinch.
359.484
359.560
That's not new.
361.594
361.700
**LOL**
361.762
I don't know how you can trust
any of his moves now.
364.262
364.331
His whole repertoire
could be lifted.
366.797
366.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
368.269
You know, it's strange, because
he's such an honest mechanic.
371.133
# JERRY
371.205
I know, he's probably the only
honest mechanic in New York.
374.172
# JERRY
374.475
So he stole my move,
and he's using it on Elaine.
377.373
# GEORGE
377.444
You told David Puddy your move,
and you didn't tell me?
379.978
380.047
I need a move.
You know I have no moves, Jerry.
382.342
382.900

Give me a bite.
383.563
# JERRY

Can I just get it open first?
384.711
# GEORGE
384.785
I can't believe you're
hoarding sex moves.
386.944
387.021
I'm rubbing two sticks together,
you're walking around with a Zippo.

All right, all right. Here.

# JERRY
394.628
You feel better?
395.559
# GEORGE
395.559
Yeah, much better.
396.491
396.564
So, what's the move?
Because I need something.
398.996
399.066
This woman I'm dating is doing
her nails during lovemaking.
401.999
# JERRY
402.069
Nancy Klopper?
402.716
# GEORGE
402.716
Yeah.
403.363
403.437
I've never seen anyone so bored.
405.232
405.306
I'm working like a dog here.
Give me a moan, something.
407.966
408.042
I'd settle for a belch, for God's sake.
Come on, let's have it.
411.373
410.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
411.445
All right, George, I'm gonna tell you.
But I just want to make sure...
414.605
# GEORGE
414.682
Yeah, it's in the vault.
I'm putting it in the vault.
417.182
417.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
417.251
It's not even a question of that.
419.012
419.086
The point is, when something
like this is passed along...
421.711
421.789
one must be certain that it's going
to be used in a conscientious way.
425.188
425.700
**LOL**
425.259
This is not some parlor trick
to be used...
427.384
427.461
pell-mell or willy-nilly.
428.774
# GEORGE
428.774
You gonna tell me or not?
430.086
# JERRY
430.397
All right.
432.158
432.233
On your bed, you got a headboard?
You'll need a headboard.
434.893
# GEORGE
434.969
I got a headboard.
436.127
# JERRY
436.203
Is it padded?
436.833
# GEORGE
436.833
No.
437.463
# JERRY
437.538
Good.
439.265
439.000
**LOL**
439.473
How tall is she?
441.053
# GEORGE
441.053
Five-foot-4, why?
442.633
# JERRY
442.710
You can't have more than
a 1 foot differential in your heights.
445.711
445.779
Otherwise you could
really hurt your neck.
448.473
448.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
448.582
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this.
450.741

George, if you can master this,
you'll never be alone again.
454.285
454.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
457.524
Now the end is kind of an option.
I use the swirl.
460.718
460.100
**LOL**
460.794
I like the swirl.
I'm comfortable with the swirl.
463.658
463.731
I feel the swirl is a great capper.
466.800
467.300
**LOL**
466.867
He uses the pinch,
which I find a little presumptuous.
470.232
# GEORGE
470.304
Is it a clockwise swirl?
472.003
# JERRY
472.003
I prefer clockwise.
473.703

It's fusilli Jerry.

It's made from fusilli pasta.
492.390

a pasta that captures the individual.
507.400
# JERRY

Why fusilli?
509.420

I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman.

Maybe they're Wilt Chamberlain's.

# JERRY
543.310
It doesn't have to be someone
who gets lots of woman.
545.742

It could be just some guy
with a big ass.
548.211
548.500
**LOL**
# KRAMER
548.282
Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.

Yeah.
551.783
552.100

553.520
Proctologist.
554.787

No, come on.

No doctor would put that
on his car.

Have you ever met a proctologist?

a very good sense of humor.

Never. It's always an accident.

That ending was so obvious.
I would've figured that out anyway.

# JERRY
1189.287
That's it. I'm going back to Puddy.
1190.754
1190.824
No move is worth this.

# ELAINE
1192.359
You don't care
if he does the move anymore?
1194.359
# JERRY
1194.427
Are you kidding? He could do
every move I've ever done.
1197.360
1197.430
Do you know what a good mechanic is
worth? You can't compare that to sex.

In the car with my wife.
He stopped short.
1213.242
1213.313
You think I don't know
what that's about?
1215.210
1215.281
That's my own move.
I used it on Estelle 40 years ago.
1217.906
1217.984
I told everybody about it.
Everybody knows...
1220.917
1220.987
I stop short.

Come on, Frank, relax. I don't know

You think I don't know, Assman?
1240.765
