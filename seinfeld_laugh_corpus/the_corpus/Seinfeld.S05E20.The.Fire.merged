To me the thing about birthday parties...
2.794
2.500
**LOL**
2.819
is that the first and last party
you have are quite similar.
7.240
7.309
You just kind of sit there.
8.967
9.044
You're the least excited person
at the party.
12.045
11.700
**LOL**
12.114
You don't even realize
that there is a party.
14.910
15.200
**LOL**
14.983
You don't know what's going on.
16.641
16.885
Both birthday parties,
people have to help you...
19.419
19.488
blow out the candles. You don't
even know why you're doing it.
22.580
21.500
**LOL**
22.658
What is this ritual?
What is going on?
25.158
25.200
**LOL**
25.627
It's also the only two birthday parties
where other people have to gather...
29.163
29.231
your friends together for you.
31.697
30.900
**LOL**
32.134
Sometimes they're not your friends.
They make the judgment.
34.862
34.500
**LOL**
34.936
They bring them in, and they tell you,
"These are your friends.
39.439
39.500
**LOL**
39.708
Tell them, 'Thank you for coming
to my birthday party.'"

Look at this one. It's saying,
"I'm a coffee table.
66.393
66.468
Put some coffee on me. The hotter
the better. That's what I'm here for."

# ELAINE
70.305
You know, actually,
I've got some work I've got to do.
73.340
# KRAMER
73.508
How about if the book came
with these little foldout legs...
76.475
76.545
so the book itself
becomes a coffee table?
79.443
79.400
**LOL**
# TOBY

I'd like to put some coffee on her.
Hot, scalding coffee...

are not part of the show.
520.147
520.221
You boo puppets.
You hiss villains in silent movies.

# TOBY
524.125
That's the way I express myself.
526.159

How will you make it
if you can't take it?
528.420
# JERRY
528.863
I can take it.
530.244
# TOBY
530.244
Let's go.

Hey, man, good set.

Bozo?
541.976
# ERIC
541.976
No.

# ERIC
544.827
Sorry. I...
546.009
# GEORGE
547.215
You've never heard
of Bozo the Clown?
549.146
549.500
**LOL**
# ERIC
549.217
No.
550.682
# GEORGE
550.752
How could you not know?
552.520
# ERIC
552.520
I don't know. I just don't.
554.288
# GEORGE
554.489
How can you call yourself a clown
and not know who Bozo is?
557.956
555.900
**LOL**
# ERIC
558.026
Hey, what are you hassling me for?
This is just a gig. It's not my life.
562.961
563.164
I don't know who Bozo is.
Is he a clown?
564.993
# GEORGE
565.066
What, are you kidding me?
566.861
567.100
**LOL**
# ERIC
566.935
Well, what is he?
567.969
# GEORGE
567.969
Yes, he's a clown.
569.003
# ERIC
569.070
All right. So, what's the big deal?
There's millions of clowns.
572.435
572.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
573.341
All right, just forget it.
574.841
# ERIC
574.841
Forget..? Me? You should forget it.
576.342
576.411
You're living in the past, man.
You're hung up on some clown...
579.742
579.814
from the '60s, man.
581.178
# GEORGE
581.178
All right.
582.542
582.600
**LOL**
582.784
Very good, very good. All right,
go fold your balloon animals, Eric.
586.285
586.387
Eric. What kind of name
is that for a clown, huh?
589.820
590.100
**LOL**
589.891
Excuse me. You must be George.
593.586
593.695
I'm Robin's mother.
You seem like...
597.287
597.365
such a lovely young man.
599.815
# GEORGE
599.815
Well, I do what I can.

**LOL**
# ROBIN

Hi, Ma. How's everything?
604.029
604.105
This is just a wonderful party.
608.403
# ROBIN
608.610
The burgers should be ready
in a minute.
610.439
# GEORGE
610.511
Great, great.
612.340
613.915
What's that smell?
615.744
616.284
Smoke?
618.113
617.000
**LOL**
618.353
Smoke.
619.943
620.021
Everybody, I think I smell
some smoke back here.
623.852
624.325
Fire! Get out of here!
626.552
626.628
Get out of my way!
628.593
628.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
632.367
It was an inferno in there!
633.930
# ERIC
633.930
There he is. That's him!
635.493
636.004
That's the coward that left us to die.
638.084
637.200
**LOL**
638.084
Let go.
640.165
640.500
**LOL**
646.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
649.284
I was trying to lead the way.
652.444
652.520
We needed a leader,
someone to lead the way to safety.
656.886
# ROBIN
657.425
But you yelled, "Get out of my way."
660.187
# GEORGE
660.962
Because...
662.495
664.265
as the leader, if I die...
666.993
667.135
then all hope is lost.
670.295
670.900
**LOL**
670.438
Who would lead? The clown?
673.029
674.475
Instead of castigating me,
you should be thanking me.
677.237
677.378
What kind of topsy-turvy world
do we live in where heroes...
680.777
680.848
are cast as villains,
brave men as cowards?
684.213
682.400
**LOL**
# ROBIN
684.285
But I saw you push the women
and children...
686.785
686.854
out of the way in a mad panic.
689.013
689.157
I saw you knock them down.
691.885
691.960
And when you ran out,
you left everyone behind.
695.518
# GEORGE
695.596
Seemingly. Seemingly.
To the untrained eye...
699.359
698.000
**LOL**
699.434
I can fully understand
how you got that impression.
702.230
703.338
What looked like pushing,
what looked like knocking down...
707.636
707.709
was a safety precaution.
In a fire...
710.607
710.678
you stay close to the ground.
Am I right? Well...
714.077
713.800
**LOL**
714.148
And when I ran out that door,
I was not leaving anyone behind.
719.049
719.153
Quite the contrary.
I risked my life...
722.916
722.991
making sure that exit was clear.
726.026
727.100
**LOL**
727.862
Any other questions?
729.623
# FIREMAN
730.231
How do you live with yourself?
732.162
# GEORGE
732.400
It's not easy.
733.967
734.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
737.105
So she doesn't want
to see me anymore.
739.639
# JERRY
742.910
Did you knock her over too
or just the kids?
746.343
746.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
748.683
No, her too.
750.648
750.600
**LOL**
751.786
And her mother.
753.547
753.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
754.155
Really? Her mother?
755.018
# GEORGE
755.018
Yeah.
755.882
756.524
I may have stepped
on her arm too.
759.252
759.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
760.261
You probably couldn't see
because of the smoke.
762.795
# GEORGE
762.864
Yeah.
764.192
764.265
But it was somebody's arm.
766.299
766.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
767.035
So you feel "women and children first"
in this day and age...
770.502
770.571
is somewhat
of an antiquated notion.
772.832
773.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
773.808
To some degree, yeah.
775.136
# JERRY
775.209
So basically, it's every man, woman,
child and invalid for themselves.
779.837
780.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
781.215
In a manner of speaking.
782.261
# JERRY
782.261
Yeah.
783.306
783.551
Well, it's honest.
784.346
# GEORGE
784.346
Yeah.
785.141
785.219
She should be commending me
for treating everyone like equals.
788.982
789.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
789.991
Perhaps when she's released
from the burn center...
792.616
793.200
**LOL**
792.693
she'll see things differently.
794.693
# GEORGE
797.031
Perhaps.
798.860
799.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
799.867
So, what was the fire,
just some greasy hamburgers?
802.401
# GEORGE
802.470
Yeah. Eric the clown
put it out with his big shoe.
807.200
807.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
812.146
By the way, did you see this?
813.925
# GEORGE
813.925
What's that?
815.704
# JERRY
816.184
The Leonard Christian
article about my show.
818.752
818.820
Plus my gig in Miami got canceled.
I bet you it's because of the article.
822.856
# GEORGE
823.224
He really does a number on you.
"Seinfeld froze like a deer...
826.657

in the headlights in the face
of incessant heckling."
830.354
828.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
830.498
I should've let her have it.
I held back because of Kramer.
833.431
# GEORGE
833.668
Know what you should do?
835.133
835.203
Go to her office and heckle her.
836.584
# JERRY
836.584
Right.
837.965
838.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
838.039
All the comedians say, "What if I came
to your work and heckled you?"
841.870
# JERRY
841.943
Yeah, that'd be something.
843.591
# GEORGE
843.591
I'm not kidding. You should do it.
845.240
# JERRY
846.013
Wouldn't that be the ultimate
comedian's revenge?
848.308
848.382
I've always had a fantasy about that.
850.178
# GEORGE
850.178
Well, go ahead. Do it.
851.974
# JERRY
852.353
Why can't I?
853.318
# GEORGE
853.318
No reason.
854.284
# JERRY
854.689
You know what?
I think I'm gonna do that.
857.553
857.625
She came down to where I work.
I'll go down to where she works.
860.626
861.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
860.995
This is unprecedented.

Hey, nice shoes.
Do you wear sandals to work?
876.736
875.400

876.811
It's nice to walk into a room
and get the aroma of feet.
879.812
879.900
**LOL**
879.881
Real conducive
to the work atmosphere.
881.881

I'm sure your coworkers like it.
883.516
883.584
"Hey, let's go eat in Toby's office."

We can check on her bunions."

Security?
901.001
901.068
I don't know how you'll make it
in this business if you can't take it.

You got to be tough.

Toby!
921.379

**LOL**
# KRAMER
925.560
What did you go out there
to heckle her for?
927.924
# JERRY
928.029
Because she came down the club
and heckled me.
930.120
930.198
I gave her a taste
of her own medicine.
931.993
# KRAMER
932.066
Oh, yeah! You gave her a taste
of medicine, all right.
936.034
933.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
936.103
I didn't want her to have an accident.
937.917
# GEORGE
937.917
What accident?
939.730
# KRAMER
939.807
After he heckled Toby,
she ran out of the building...
943.104
943.177
and a street sweeper
ran over her foot...
945.507
945.580
and severed her pinkie toe.
947.580
947.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
948.049
That's unbelievable.
949.447
# KRAMER
949.447
Yeah. Then after the ambulance left...
950.845
950.918
I found the toe.
952.952
953.200
**LOL**
953.054
I put it in a Cracker Jack box with ice
and took off for the hospital.
957.215
957.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
957.291
You ran?
958.655
# KRAMER
958.655
No. I jumped on the bus.
960.019
960.094
I told the driver,
"I got a toe here, buddy. Step on it."
962.719
963.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
964.031
Holy cow!
965.048
# KRAMER
965.048
Yeah, yeah.
966.065
966.200
Then all of a sudden,
this guy pulls out a gun.
969.997
970.071
Well, I knew any delay's
gonna cost her her pinkie toe...
972.901
973.100
**LOL**
972.974
so I got up, and I started walking
towards him.
976.066
976.277
He says, "Where do you think
you're going, Cracker Jack?"
979.073
979.500
**LOL**
979.146
I says, "Well, I got a prize
for you, buddy."
982.010
985.300
**LOL**
984.986
Knocked him out cold.
986.253
# GEORGE
986.253
How could you do that?
987.520
# KRAMER
987.588
Then everybody is screaming
because the driver's passed out...
990.748
990.825
because of all the commotion.
The bus is out of control.
994.520
995.100
**LOL**
995.796
So I grab him by the collar,
take him out of the seat...
998.490
998.566
get behind the wheel.
Now I'm driving the bus.
1001.430
1001.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1003.237
You're Batman.
1004.567
# KRAMER
1004.567
Yeah. I am Batman.
1005.897
1005.973
Then the mugger, he comes to,
and he starts choking me.
1009.065
1009.143
So I'm fighting him off
with one hand...
1011.108
1011.178
and I kept driving the bus
with the other, you know?
1014.008
1014.100
**LOL**
1014.081
Then I managed to open the door
and kicked him out the door...
1017.014
1017.084
with my foot, you know,
at the next stop.
1019.311
# JERRY
1019.787
You kept making all the stops?

What happened to the toe?
1036.065
# KRAMER
1036.137
Well, I am happy to say...
1037.932
1038.005
the little guy's back in place
at the end of the line.
1041.700
1041.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1043.377
You did all this for a pinkie toe?
1047.106
# KRAMER
1047.682
Well, it's a valuable appendage.
1050.114
1051.100

Sure, the pinkie toe is cute...
1103.199
1103.270
but I mean, what is it? It's useless.
1106.066
1106.140
It does nothing. It's got that little nail
that is just impossible to cut.
1110.836
1111.500
**LOL**
1110.911
Why do we need it?
1111.809
# JERRY
1111.809
That's the one...
1112.706
1112.780
that goes "wee, wee, wee"
all the way home.
1114.871
# ELAINE
1116.050
You just shut the...

Elaine, did you hear the news?
1118.641
1118.719
Toby got promoted.
1120.066
# ELAINE
1120.066
Yes, I heard, Kramer.
1121.413
1121.489
I work there, remember?
1123.138
# KRAMER
1123.138
You know what she told me?
1124.786
1124.000
**LOL**
1124.859
Her first order of business
is to put my coffee table book...
1127.928
1127.995
into the bookstores
as soon as possible.
1130.495
# ELAINE
1130.564
Oh, wonderful.
1131.894
# KRAMER
1131.894
Throughout this whole thing...
1133.224
1133.000
**LOL**
1133.300
she always kept smiling.
1135.432
# ELAINE
1135.432
Of course. She's deranged.
1137.564
1138.100

# JERRY
1140.574
I went down to the magazine,
pleaded with him to see me again.
1143.472
1143.544
He agreed to come down tonight
and write another article.

# RONNIE
1146.614
I heard you went down
to somebody's office...
1148.909
1148.983
and heckled them.
1150.000
# JERRY
1150.000
Damn right.
1151.017
1150.700
**LOL**
1151.085
We've been lap dogs long enough.
1152.432
# RONNIE
1152.432
How could you do that?
1153.779
1153.854
Everybody's talking about it.
1155.546
# JERRY
1155.623
It's about time one of us
drew a line in the sand.
1158.248
# RONNIE
1158.392
Jerry, you're like Rosa Parks.
1161.893
1162.300
**LOL**
1162.863
You opened the door for all of us.
1164.794
1164.865
I can't wait
until somebody heckles me.

# GEORGE
1179.276
Robin, listen to me.
1180.674
1180.748
The most amazing thing
has happened.
1182.941
1183.017
Kramer has opened my eyes.
1185.779
1185.920
I think I've changed.
1187.317
# ROBIN
1188.389
What are you talking about?
1189.303
# GEORGE
1189.303
Okay.
1190.218
# JERRY
1190.291
I mean, Bozo the Clown.
1192.291
1192.393
I mean, does he really need
"the Clown" in his title?
1196.224
1196.297
As clown. Bozo the Clown.
1198.490
1198.833
Are we gonna confuse him with Bozo
the district attorney?
1202.027
1202.136
Bozo the pope?
There's no other Bozo.
1205.296
1205.100

# GEORGE
1205.539
You'll see. Things will be different now
if you'll just give me one more chance.
1210.576
# ROBIN
1210.778
Listen, I got to think about this.
1213.904
# GEORGE
1213.981
All right, but I'm serious about this.
1216.278
# RONNIE
1216.278
All right. Hand it over, man.
1218.575
# JERRY
1220.321
That's why men hunt
and women nest.

# GEORGE
1222.456
He's got a gun! He's got a gun!
1224.990
1225.059
Get out of the way!

The prop comic?

1241.200
**LOL**
1242.710
Hi. I didn't...
1244.107
1244.178
I didn't recognize you.
What, did you..? You get a haircut?

George?
1252.346
1252.686
Could I have a word?
1254.720
1256.000
**LOL**
1263.697
I was in a hotel, and the back of a door
in the hotel, they have that fire map.
1267.324
1265.700
**LOL**
1267.401
I'm flattered they think
I'll stand in a burning hotel room...
1270.265
1270.337
memorizing directions.
1271.927
1272.100
**LOL**
1272.072
I'll go left by the stair,
right by the candy machine.
1276.040
1275.800
**LOL**
1276.277
I'd probably get lost, have to go back
to the room, check the map again.
1280.575
1279.300
**LOL**
1281.615
They always tell you, whatever you do
in a hotel fire, do not panic.
1286.277
1286.387
Hey, I've got four minutes to live.
I've never panicked in my life.
1289.479
1289.557
It's my option.
1291.318
1290.900
**LOL**
1291.592
Even if they find you,
you have a perfect excuse.
1294.183
1294.495
They saved you
swinging from the shower curtain...
1296.790
1296.864
naked with the ice bucket
on your head. What happened?
1299.865
