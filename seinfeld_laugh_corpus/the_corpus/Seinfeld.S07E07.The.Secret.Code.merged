They really got us trained to use
that cash machine. Don't they?

We're just like chickens in an experiment
waiting for that pellet to come down the shoot.

You see people
at the cash machine.

**LOL**
11.455
Tick-tick-tick-tick-
tick-tick-tick.

Waiting for the sound.
You know the sound.
16.133
16.166
You're waiting for the sound.
17.866
17.500
**LOL**
17.900
That's what we're trained
to hear.
19.366

The here-comes-the-money sound,
you know?
22.133
22.166
Pft-pft-pft-pft-pft.
23.727

It's exciting.
Don't you get excited?

George, you're gonna
marry this woman.

It says very clearly,
"For your protection,

So you're taking relationship
advice from Chemical Bank now?
71.316
71.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
71.350
Why does everything
have to be "us"?
73.650
73.683
Is there no "me" left?
75.150
75.183
Why can't there be some things
just for me? Is that so selfish?
78.350
# JERRY
78.595
Actually, that's
the definition of selfish.
81.291
81.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
81.337
Have you ever given
your code to anyone?
82.683

No one's ever asked.
Do you want it? It's "Jor-El."
86.183

Of course.

It's eating you up inside.

If you're in some situation where
some fast cash will save your life,
107.372
107.411
I'll give you the code.

So?
138.650
# ELAINE
138.683
So we've met before.
140.850
140.883
At Katie Ash's party.
We talked for, like, 10 minutes.
144.083
142.800

And he didn't remember you?

Hi.
156.083

"Nice to meet you,"
158.150

but actually
we've met before.
159.550
# FRED
159.583
We have?
160.883
# ELAINE
160.916
Yeah.
Yeah, at Katie Ash's party.
162.416
# FRED
162.450
What was your name again?

# ELAINE
164.183
Elaine. You don't remember
our conversation?
167.250
166.200
**LOL**
167.283
I talked about how
my uncle worked
169.550
169.200

169.583
in the book depository building
with Lee Harvey Oswald.
172.550
173.400
**LOL**
# FRED
173.516
Not ringing a bell.
174.916
# ELAINE
174.950
Wh-when my uncle said to him,
"The president's been shot,"
178.050
178.083
Oswald winked at him and said,
"I'm gonna go catch a movie."
181.283
182.100
**LOL**
# FRED
182.583
No.
183.916
# ELAINE
184.012
That was right when we were
in front of the bathroom door.
186.316
# FRED
186.350
The bathroom door.
188.050
188.083
I remember someone had played
tic-tac-toe on it,
190.483
190.500
**LOL**
190.516
and the Xs won.
191.883
191.916
They went diagonally from the
top left to the bottom right.

All right, bye.
208.550
208.583
Huh. How do you like that?
209.716
209.750
I'm gonna do some TV spots
210.916
210.950
for Leapin' Larry's
Appliance Store.
212.583
212.616
That was Leapin' Larry himself.
I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

# KRAMER
215.250
Leapin' Larry, yeah,

217.383
# JERRY
217.416
What is that?
218.383
# KRAMER
218.416
Well, it's
an emergency band scanner.
220.525
220.550
It picks up everything:
221.650
221.683
fires, harbor patrol,
even the police.
224.516
224.550
I'm watchin'
the watchers, Jerry.
228.316
226.800
**LOL**
228.350
Uh-oh.
229.483
229.516
We got a big fire on 115th.
232.116
232.150
God, I tell you, if I could
do it over again,
234.283
234.316
I'd give it all up
to be a fireman.
235.950
# JERRY
235.983
Yeah, those civil servants
who risk their lives
238.016
238.050
really got it made.
239.116
239.150
Yeah.
240.483

# KRAMER
240.516
When I was a kid,
all I ever dreamed of
242.783

was steering the back

You're lucky
they let you drive a car.

Shh. No, no, no.
250.016

They're taking
the West Side Highway.
251.783
251.816
At this time of day?
That's insane.
253.450
253.483
They're heading
straight into gridlock.

Oh, those fools.

So...get a load of this.

remembers every little thing
about that night except me.
270.816

Really? I'm surprised.
He doesn't meet that many women.

So, what are you saying?
276.373

He didn't remember you.
279.850

# JERRY
292.658
Yeah. You wrote a good piece
on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.
294.916
# ELAINE
294.950
Too good.
Peterman was so pleased
296.583
296.616
now he wants to take me
out to dinner tomorrow.
299.350

Maybe you wanna come with me.

302.116
Oh, please, Jerry.
Please, please, please.
304.083
304.116
I can't sit with him.
He tells these stories.
304.902
306.183
It's gonna be awful.

314.783
# GEORGE
314.816
Why? Why is my code
so important?
316.516
# SUSAN
316.550
Because it's part
of our relationship.
318.550
317.400
**LOL**
318.583
It's an indication
of trust.
320.450
320.583
We're not supposed to
keep secrets from one another.
323.050
# GEORGE
323.083
Well, I-I'm sure
you have secrets from me.
325.383

so long.

When I lost my leg in the
boating accident last year,
367.516
367.550
I got so depressed
about this damn prosthetic,
371.283
371.316
I thought I was gonna
have to give up the business.
374.050
374.083
But now...I'm rejuvenated.
376.883

Is that
what you've sunk to?

You know,
the guy has one leg,
415.050
415.083
and he still calls himself
Leapin' Larry.
417.183
417.216
You'd think he'd have
a sense of humor about it.
419.350

burned down.

Peterman? Nobody mentioned
anything about Peterman.

Of course not.
If I did, would you have gone?

No way.
There you go.

I don't even know Peterman.
461.492

Now how am I gonna relax?
462.816
462.850
I'm gonna have to be on
all night.

I got this new shirt.
The button fell off.

Once the button falls off,
that's it.

I'll never fix it.

Why, do you have other plans?
507.216

507.250
No. No, no. No.
None that I can, um... remember.

# JERRY
515.650
All right. You're locked up
in a prison in Turkey.
518.816
518.850
I have your wallet.
520.150
520.183
The only way I can bribe
the guards to get you out is
522.616
522.650
for you to give me
your ATM code.
524.381
# GEORGE
524.406
Call the embassy.

They're closed.
526.586
# GEORGE
526.617
Why?
527.856
# JERRY
527.856
Bomb threat.

We're in Turkey?

# JERRY

So is, uh, Elaine here?
551.792
# PETERMAN
552.416
Oh, Elaine just called.
554.016
554.050
She won't be joining us.
555.716
555.900
But not to worry.
557.400
557.433
I'll tell the maֳ®tre d'
it'll just be the three bulls.
561.005
561.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
564.275
What's goin' on? He still wants
to have dinner with us?

What is he, crazy?
569.100
# JERRY
569.900
Oh, we gotta get outta here.

Come on, weave your web,

**LOL**
# GEORGE
575.433
I got nothing.

most accommodating.
585.850

Shall we?
586.950
# JERRY
586.983
Uh, actually, you know,
I just remembered
588.950
588.983
I promised this comedy club
that I'd do a set tonight,
591.483
591.516
so I'm terribly sorry.
592.916
# PETERMAN
592.950
I understand.
No hard feelings.
595.483
595.516
George and I
will miss your company.
597.183
597.216
Fong!
598.450
598.000
**LOL**
598.483
It will just be two
this evening.
600.350
601.550
Well, George...
602.716
602.200
**LOL**
604.216
...we dine.

**LOL**
# ELAINE
608.483
Ugh. I can't believe this. This guy's standing me up?
613.316

**LOL**
# PETERMAN
616.016
And there... tucked
into the river's bend,
619.416
619.450
was the object
of my search:
621.516
621.550
the Guangia River Market.
624.416
624.450
Fabrics and spices
traded under a starlit sky.
628.583
627.700
**LOL**
628.616
It was there...
630.616
630.650
that I discovered
the Pamplona Beret.
632.750
632.783
Sizes seven and a half through
eight and three quarters.
635.283
635.316
Price...$35.
635.402
638.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
641.016
What about sports?
You follow sports?
644.283
# TVANNOUNCER
644.316
It's fourth and inches,
646.450
645.400
**LOL**
646.483
and the Giants
are going for it.
648.016
648.050
You've gotta love sports.
650.216
650.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
651.216
You know, this is very nice,
652.783
652.816
but I really could
take a cab, really
654.750
# PETERMAN
654.783
Ha-ha-ha.
Nonsense, George.
656.950
656.983
Besides, it gives me a chance
658.283
658.316
to tell you about
my latest trip to Burma.
660.150
660.645
I discovered
a very unusual corduroy.
663.816
664.400
**LOL**
# PETERMAN
667.566
Peterman here.
669.133
670.166
What?
671.566
671.600
Oh, no.
672.966
673.500
All right. I'll be right there.
675.066
675.100
It's my mother.
She's at death's door.
677.800
677.833
What?
679.566
679.600
I just pray to God we can
make it there in time.
681.633

684.055
I can't believe you blew us off.
We were doing you the favor.

688.933
# JERRY

Fred?
690.566
# ELAINE
690.600
Yeah, and then he stood me up.
692.100
692.600
**LOL**
692.133
I don't get this guy.
693.766
# JERRY
693.800
You see what's going on here.
695.548
695.573
You're attracted to him
696.441
696.466
because he can't remember
anything about you.
698.058
# ELAINE
698.083
I am? But that's so sick.
700.675
# JERRY
700.933
That's God's plan.
702.258
702.283
He doesn't really want anyone
to get together.
705.290
# ELAINE
706.650
Anyway, so how was the dinner?
708.083
# JERRY
708.116
Well... when I heard
you weren't coming,
710.883
710.916
I made up an excuse
and got the hell out of there.
712.883
713.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
712.916
What about Georgie?
714.483
# JERRY
715.283
Ah, he didn't make it.
717.116
719.300
**LOL**
# PETERMAN
719.750
Doctor, how is she?
721.050

It's morning.
757.316

Thanks for seeing me
through the night.
759.716

I'll make us
a pot of coffee, George.
761.816
761.850
Watch her, won't you?
763.150

763.183
Who?
764.366
# PETERMAN
764.366
Mama.
765.550

Just talk to her,

The doctor seems
to think it helps.

Hi.
781.316
781.350

# GEORGE
787.316
We had this big fight
yesterday, and...
790.216
791.408
well, she
792.416
792.566
She wants to-- To know
my secret code, you know.
795.466
796.400
**LOL**
796.133
I-- I don't know.
797.500
797.533
I can't tell her. I...
799.700
802.000
The funny thing is, you know, I would...
really love to tell someone...
806.033
806.066
'cause it's--
It's killing me.

808.100
**LOL**
813.000

815.400
You wanna know
what it is?
817.217
817.800
**LOL**
820.883
It's "Bosco."
822.950
822.700

822.983
You know, the chocolate syrup.
824.950
824.983
I love that stuff.
I pour it in milk.

This whole thing never would have happened if you
871.716
871.750
hadn't bailed out on me
at the restaurant.
873.516
# JERRY
873.550
I did not bail out on you.
875.050
# GEORGE
875.083
Why couldn't you include me
in your excuse?
877.083
# JERRY
877.116
Why didn't you
come up with your own?
878.650
# GEORGE
878.816
I froze. I think I'm losing it.

Maybe you're just in a slump.

884.083
No, no.

886.816
and there was nothing there!

# GEORGE
889.550
Now Peterman wants me
to go to the funeral.
891.550

Oh, come on, just tell me
your code already. What is it?

Uh, let's see. Um...
906.633
906.716
Well, we can throw out
birthdays immediately.
909.183
909.316
That's too obvious.
910.750
910.783
And no numbers for you.
You're a word man.
913.250
913.283
All right. Let's go deeper.
915.250
915.283
Uh...what kind of man are you?
918.116
918.300
Well, you're weak, spineless.
921.194
920.300
**LOL**
921.381
A man of temptations.
924.100

But what tempts you?
925.469
# GEORGE
925.533
Huh?
926.500
# KRAMER
926.833
You're a portly fellow.
929.566
929.600
**LOL**
929.600
A little long

932.600
932.633
So, what's your pleasure?
934.666
935.000
**LOL**

Is it the salty snacks
you crave?
938.144
938.200

Yours is a sweet tooth.

When Mama said "Bosco,"
980.387
980.500
she must have been trying
to communicate something.
982.900
982.933
Her legacy.
A dying wish, perhaps.

1034.816
I heard a rumor

Well, I--

fine the way they are.

She couldn't find
her pills.
1164.366

I had to go into Brooklyn,
help her find the pills,

# FRED

I could take a cab,

but if my mother saw me
pull up in a cab,
1187.033
1187.066
she'd start yelling at me.
1188.200
1188.233
"Freddie, what are ya
takin' a cab for?
1189.900
1189.933
It's so expensive."
