None of that.
Not while you're living under my roof.

What?
12.052
# JOEY
12.303
Look, just because I know about you two
doesn't mean I like looking at it.
16.306

Aren't you supposed to be

Well, I'm sorry if I'm not
a middle-aged black woman.
22.354
22.900
**LOL**
24.399
And I'm also sorry if sometimes
I go to the wrong audition.
28.235
28.800
**LOL**
29.863
Okay, look, if I have to pretend
I don't know about you two...
32.614
32.782
...then you two are gonna have to pretend
there's nothing to know about.
36.118

36.661
Okay, sorry.

Yeah, my mom sent me a family heirloom

113.028
113.238
Can you believe it?
114.279
114.000
**LOL**

A year ago I didn't even have a family...

Is this mink?
136.051
# PHOEBE
136.051
Yeah.
136.718
137.178
Why would my mother send me a fur?
Doesn't she know me but at all?
142.057
142.000
**LOL**
142.767
Plus, I have a perfectly fine coat that
no innocent animals suffered to make.
147.062
# CHANDLER
147.313
Yeah, just some 9-year-old Filipino kids
who worked their fingers bloody...
150.274

...for 1 2 cents an hour.
152.025

You can't.

What is that?
172.921
# ROSS
173.298
Oh, uh, I'm getting rid
of a couple of things.
177.009
# MONICA
177.760
This is all of your things.
179.219
# ROSS
180.722
Yes, yes, it is.
182.306
182.500
**LOL**
182.849
No, but it's good. Emily thinks
we should get all new stuff.
186.351
186.603
Stuff that's just ours.
Together, you know, brand new.
189.563
# MONICA
189.814
So basically this is a "getting rid
of anything Rachel ever touched" sale.
192.733
# ROSS

Touched, used, sat on, slept on....
195.736

# ROSS
201.201
Look, if I can just do what Emily wants...
203.035
203.286
...and get her to New York,
I'm sure everything will be fine.
206.038
# CHANDLER
206.289
Okay, but don't you think
that's a little extreme?
208.290
# ROSS
208.541
After what I did, can you blame her?
210.605
# PHOEBE
210.605
Oh, my God. You got off easy.
212.669
212.879
When my friend Sylvie's husband
said someone else's name in bed...
215.505
215.673
...she cursed him
and turned his thingy green.

What is he doing?

Emily thinks Ross' furniture
has got Rachel cooties?

Calm down, Joey.
233.024

No.
233.649
233.900
Everything's getting all messed up,
you know?
235.984
236.194
Emily won't let Ross see Rachel.
237.986
238.154
We're not gonna stop seeing Rachel,
hence, Ross stops seeing us.
242.950
# PHOEBE
243.368
Oh, I hate this. Everything's changing.
245.535
# CHANDLER
245.787
Yeah, I know.
We're losing Ross, Joey said "hence."
248.413
249.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
252.585
I'm not happy about this either, but,
you know, if Ross says he's happy...
257.089
257.340
...then we just have to keep our feelings
about Emily to ourselves.
260.300
260.510
Are you cool with that?
261.843
# JOEY
262.136
No.

fresh new furniture,
why not a fresh new apartment?
369.409

Her cousin has this great place to sublet.

It's got a view of the river on one side

He was like this crazy-eyed,
hairy beast-man.

He was like a Bigfoot
or a yeti or something.

He came at us with an ax,
so Rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.

Yeah, I pulled the tab
and I just fogged his yeti ass.

Honey, I know you're quirky, and I get

But if you destroy a coat like this...
