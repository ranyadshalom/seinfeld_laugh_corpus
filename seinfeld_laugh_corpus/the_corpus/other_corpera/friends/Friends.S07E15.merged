What do you mean
you're getting a new brain?
67.274
# JOEY
67.442
They're killing off one of the characters,
and when she dies...
70.360
70.528
...and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.
73.322
73.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
74.908
Heh, what? A brain transplant?
78.702
# JOEY
# ROSS
78.870
It's ridiculous.
80.496

80.663
I think it's ridiculous that you haven't
had sex in three and a half months.
84.208

It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a beverage.
106.730

Don't do it.

112.112
And she's been on the show forever.
113.987

It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.

Yeah.

Help me out here. When you

**LOL**

Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

He left his cell phone.
200.491
# RACHEL
200.491
Oh?
201.450
201.618
We could hand it to Gunther,
he'll put it in lost and found.
204.369
# PHOEBE
204.537
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.
208.081
208.100
**LOL**
# RACHEL
208.791
What if, uh, he calls his own cell phone
to find out who found it, and I answer...
212.794
212.962
...and we start talking
and we fell in love?
215.589
215.900
**LOL**
215.798
Wouldn't that be a great story?
217.966
218.218
Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.

219.969
Yeah.

I don't know. I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

# RACHEL
230.730
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.
233.190
# PHOEBE
233.441
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.
238.028

Okay. Great. See, I get the phone.
240.405
239.300

No way. You just broke up with Tag

Yeah, and until now,
I didn't think I would love again.

347.847
Okay. Whoo, eh.
348.972
# CECILIA
349.223
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial?
373.580
373.748
And then from that, we can tell
who has more in common with him...
376.792

They don't know exactly when it's going
to happen, but apparently it's soon...
497.162
497.330
...and then that's it.
498.830
498.998
I'm sorry. If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

No, I mean it.

The-- The only reason
I came up to you before...
527.192

...was because, well...
529.236
529.487
...because I'm really nervous
about being you.
532.614
532.782
You know, if you could help me capture
the essence of the character.
536.576

Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?
539.704
542.166
All right, Joey, I will help you.
543.708
543.876
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...
547.420

You're so welcome.

At my apartment. It's, um

660.409
It's, um, 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.

825.281
825.449
...both her hands on the man's face.
828.660
828.828
Yeah, I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?
831.412
831.580
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.
