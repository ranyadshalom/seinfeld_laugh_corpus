23.022
What happened?
24.481
# JOEY
24.691
Ross was hanging out at our place.
26.358
26.609
Rachel comes to borrow
moisturizer from Chandler
29.069
29.279
Hey.
30.279
31.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER

How hard is it to say "something"?

# JOEY

Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.
41.248
# PHOEBE
41.458
Why was he yelling at her?
He slept with someone else.
44.918
# JOEY
45.128
He says they were on a break
when it happened...
47.421
47.630
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.
49.465
# PHOEBE
49.716
He is so unreasonable. God.
52.718
52.969
Although I understand what he means.
55.054
55.500
**LOL**
56.389
Oh, my God.
This is like 60 Minutes...
58.974
59.184
...when at first you're mad
at that pharmaceutical company...
62.102
62.270
...for making the drug.
63.270
63.438
And then, you just feel bad
for the people because...
66.148

...they needed
to make their hair grow.
68.942

...did you get the tape that was
half the last episode of M.A.S.H...
734.524
734.734
...and half the hostages coming home?
736.943
737.700
**LOL**
# CAROL
738.362
But now it's Susan and me in Mexico
and the hostages coming home.
742.031
742.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
742.491
Where's Ben?
743.533
# CAROL
743.743
He's sleeping.
744.368
# ROSS
744.368
Ah. Ooh.
744.993
747.204
Is this a bad time?
749.122
# CAROL
749.373
Yeah, actually.
Susan's gonna be here any minute.
752.167
752.376
It's kind of an anniversary.
753.460
# ROSS
753.460
Oh.
754.544
754.712
I thought you guys
got married in January.
757.172
# CAROL
757.381
A different kind of anniversary.
759.090
# ROSS
759.300
Oh.
762.343
763.600
**LOL**
# CAROL
763.929
So anyway
765.638
765.890
Candles, champagne....
767.807
# ROSS
768.184
Yeah, anniversaries are great...
770.602
771.103
...because love lasts forever,
you know?
773.605
774.440
There's nothing like it
in this life. Money in the bank.
777.692
777.943
So Rachel and I broke up.
779.694
779.600
**LOL**
# CAROL
781.238
God, Ross, I am so sorry.
783.782
# ROSS
785.284
You know what?
786.284
# CAROL
786.535
I wanna talk about this so much...
788.578
788.788
...but when we can really get into it.
791.080
791.332
You free for dinner tomorrow?
792.457
# ROSS
792.457
I'd love that.
793.583
# CAROL
793.751
Me too.
794.751
# ROSS
794.919
I guess it all started
when Rachel got this new job.

814.187
# RACHEL
814.438
We are definitely on Route 27.
817.440
# PHOEBE
817.650
We are at a rest stop on Route 27
820.652
820.861
There is no Route 27.
822.612
823.000
**LOL**
822.822
Either 93 or 76.
824.093
# RACHEL
824.093
I don't know.
825.365
825.574
I always slept in the back
when we drove here.
828.117
# PHOEBE
829.286
Can you just send someone up and down
76 and check every rest stop?
834.040
834.291
And also 93?
836.084
834.900
**LOL**
837.545
Okay.
838.670
838.879
No, they don't do that.

Somebody will come and save us.
845.677
# MONICA
845.928
Who? Have you seen a car
in the last hour and a half?
849.264
849.515
We should call Ross.
Maybe he can get a car to get us.
852.600
# RACHEL
852.852
I am not getting in a car with Ross.
855.103
855.354
We will just have to...

...live here.
858.231
859.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
859.692
But it's so cold.
860.463
# RACHEL
860.463
No.
861.234

I won't get in a car with him.
Think of something else.

865.155
Joey and Chandler are back.

# JOEY
871.036
Oh, yeah.
872.203
872.600
**LOL**
872.663
Smokey Joe here got halfway

876.541
# CHANDLER
876.750
I have the lung capacity
of a 2-year-old.
879.043
879.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
879.712
Then why are you smoking?
881.170
# CHANDLER
881.380
It's very unsettling.
882.755
884.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
886.302
Right? I mean,
it's pretty unbelievable.
888.845
889.096
They just took off
without even looking back.
892.682
893.517
I don't need them.
I've got you guys now as friends.
896.895
897.146
You and Susan.
898.229

Seven-one-seven?
904.861

You have more of these
for Susan, right?
911.409
# CAROL
911.660
No, but that's okay.
913.119

I'll just put out pickles
or something.

Hey, Rach. The tampons here
are only a penny.
930.136

Let's stock up.
932.013

We're out of gas and don't know where
we are, so we can't get a tow truck.

941.565
I'm sorry your
car broke down, Pheebs...

...but I'm too busy with some of
my real friends right now.
947.570
947.780
But please call to let me know
you got home safely.

Phoebe, hang on a second.
952.659
952.952
Take my car.
Get your friends.
954.619
# ROSS
954.828
No, I won't pick them up.
956.454
# CAROL
956.705
We both know you'll do it
because you're not a jerk.
959.666
959.917
So you can sulk here for half an hour,
then go get them...
962.877
963.128
...or save time and sulk in the car.
964.588
# ROSS
964.588
Rachel doesn't
966.047
# CAROL
966.298
I'm sorry Rachel dumped you for Mark...
968.466
968.676
...and you're the innocent victim
in this.
971.219
971.470
But don't punish your friends
for what Rachel did.
974.263
# ROSS
976.642
Yeah, you're right.
977.892
# CAROL
978.519
Phoebe, hang on.
Ross wants to say something.
981.229

What? You slept with someone else?

You slept with another woman?

1005.211
# MONICA
1007.464
What's "pleh"?
1008.506
# JOEY
1009.675
That's "help" spelled backwards...
1011.884
1012.094
...so that the helicopters can read it
from the air.

Unless I'm stepping on
some toes here...
1038.036
1038.245
...in which case,
I could just mosey on.

He drove all the way up here.

1061.769
Just send him back,
then we'll go skiing?

# CHANDLER
1064.271
This is horrible.
It's just horrible.
1067.148

If, uh, it might be okay if
Ross came skiing?

# CHANDLER
1107.815
I can handle it.
"Handle" is my middle name.

Look. We know that this is
really, really hard for you guys.
1194.358
1195.360
You don't have to love each other.

You don't even have to like
each other much right now.

1201.450
But please find a way
to be around each other.
1204.285
