You two would have

# JOEY
682.682
All right. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
684.599
684.850
This is Ross. Okay?
686.643
686.852
He's our friend.
He obviously went crazy.
690.021
690.231
He obviously lost his mind.
692.232

**LOL**
# ROSS
692.483
I didn't lose my mind, okay?
Janice and I have a lot in common.
696.736

We've both been divorced.
We both have kids.

# RACHEL
712.795
I have to tell you something
that I've never admitted.
715.964
716.132
In high school, I made out with James
even though I knew that you liked him.
720.343
720.511
Wow! That feels so good
to get off my chest. Okay, you go.
723.805
724.100

# RACHEL
726.620
Ugh.
727.892
728.102
Monica....
729.352
730.354
I know about you and Chandler.
732.313
# MONICA
733.441
What?
734.482
# RACHEL
734.650
I overheard you
on the phone the other day.
737.026
737.194
You said, "I'll tell Rachel I'm doing
laundry for a couple of hours."
741.531
741.741
And he said, "Laundry?
Is that my new nickname?"
744.784
744.952
And you said, "No.
746.870
747.037
You know what
your nickname is, Mr. Big."
751.040
751.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
755.171
Well, heh....
756.588

761.427
Wow, I-- Let me know how
that one turns out.
764.304
# RACHEL
764.472
I wouldn't know because I got
so freaked out I hung up the phone.
768.975
765.100
**LOL**
# MONICA
769.143
Well, if you had kept listening, ha-ha-ha...
771.603
771.854
...you would have heard me
call him Mister Big...
775.565
775.733

# RACHEL
785.826
All right. So that's it.
788.077
788.329
You're telling me there's nothing going on

822.112
It's so weird to say this,
but I just had a great date with Janice.
826.324
# JOEY
826.534
What?
827.305
# PHOEBE
827.305
Are you serious?
828.076
# ROSS
828.244
Yeah. I opened up to her about all the
terrible stuff that's been happening to me.
832.914
833.082
I mean, I talked for hours.
835.208
835.376
It is amazing...
836.501
836.710
...to have someone give you
such focused attention.
840.296
# PHOEBE
840.464
You don't need Janice for that.
You've got us.
843.466
# JOEY
843.634
And the duck gets the Nutter Butter!
845.177
# PHOEBE
845.177
No! Agh!
846.719
846.700
**LOL**
846.887
That's not a Nutter Butter.
That's an old won ton!
849.597
# JOEY

**LOL**
# KARA

871.035
# MONICA
871.203
None for me.
872.225
# CHANDLER
872.225
Just a little bit of sugar.
873.246
# DOUG
873.414
I'll have Monica stick her finger in it.
875.456
875.624
That ought to sweeten it up.
877.000
878.500
**LOL**
# MONICA
881.589
How does that not give you a headache?
883.027
# CHANDLER

You get used to it.
884.465
# MONICA
884.633
I don't think that I can.
886.134
886.302
Maybe this will be it for me
on the work things.
888.803
# CHANDLER
888.971
So I laugh at my boss's jokes.
What's the big deal?
891.431
# MONICA
891.599
I'd rather not hang out with
this work-weasel guy...
894.142
894.310
...when I could be with my boyfriend,
who I actually respect.
897.645
# CHANDLER
897.813
Oh.

900.000
**LOL**
# DOUG

Ah, heh.
901.858
902.026
I gotta apologize for Kara's coffee.
904.319
904.486
I'd feel sorry for it if it got in a fight.
906.487
906.655
It's not strong enough
to defend itself. Ha-ha-ha!
910.533
912.500
**LOL**
913.621
Hear what I said?
914.913
# CHANDLER
915.915
What?

It's a joke, Bing.
What's the matter with you?
920.418
# CHANDLER
920.586
Well, I just didn't think
it was funny, sir.
923.671
# DOUG
923.881
Excuse me?
924.923
# CHANDLER
926.383
Well, I just--
927.384
# MONICA
927.384
Honey?
928.384
928.761
I just don't think
you understood the joke.
931.095
# CHANDLER
932.222
Really?
932.972
933.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
932.972
Yeah.
933.723
933.891
I mean, it was really funny.
I just don't think that you got it.
937.310
937.478
Heh, you see,
Kara's coffee is weak-tasting.
941.064
941.231
But what Doug did was imply
that it was weak physically.
945.193
947.780
You get it now, honey?
948.697
# CHANDLER
948.697

What? She just called and said
she was going to be working late.
982.438

Well, what I was doing
in Chandler's room is that, um...
1057.305
1057.556
...I was cleaning it.
1058.848
1060.100
**LOL**
1060.267
In fact, he pays me to clean it.
1061.539
1061.539
Oh!

1062.978
What a great way to make
some extra pocket money.
1066.439

I hope this isn't too weird but, uh...
1256.379

# ROSS
1267.849
Because there's certain rules
about this kind of stuff.
1271.060
1271.270
You don't, uh-- You don't fool around
with your friends' ex-girlfriends...
1275.022
1275.190
...or, uh...
1276.315
1276.483
...possible girlfriends
or girls they're related to.

But you know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna forgive you.
1290.913
1291.081
Because that's what friends do.
1293.124
1293.292
They forgive their friends when
they do everything you just said.
1296.294
1296.461
All the things on the list there.
