I can't get her out of my head.

798.631
I'm a very bad person.
I'm a very, very bad person.

You've been avoiding her
since we started dating.
886.384
886.594
I made an effort to like Janice.
888.761
889.013
Now you make an effort to like Kathy
by going out with us. Right?
893.474
# CHANDLER

Yeah, right.
895.185
# JOEY
895.185
Good. And hey, my treat.

# CHANDLER
1009.174
You know what it is?
The fishnet stockings.
1012.218
1012.428
Whenever I see a girl in those,
it reminds me of...

# CHANDLER
1062.978
What do you say, I go tell her
how much I like her?
1066.439
1066.940
I could tell her
I've been thinking of her.
1069.358
1069.610
I haven't stopped thinking
of her since we met.
1071.944
1072.196
I'm so over-the-top,
want-to-slit-my-own-throat...
1075.156
1075.365
...in love with her,
that every minute...
