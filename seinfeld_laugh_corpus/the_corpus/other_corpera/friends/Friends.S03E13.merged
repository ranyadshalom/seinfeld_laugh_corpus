Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing
some things out of the dryer...
56.930
57.098
...and static cling. Ha, ha.
59.224
59.392
Or maybe it's just because God knew
I'd be running into you...
61.810
61.978
...and saw an opportunity.
63.687

And he, like, you know, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.
203.952
204.120
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts of jock stuff.
207.831

Oh, um, around 8:02.
224.139
224.900
**LOL**
224.307
And we, uh, talked for a little while...
227.017
227.185
...and then, um, we went out
for an innocent burger.

# CHANDLER
237.737
Well, she spent the last six months
getting over him...
239.988
240.156
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.
244.785
244.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
245.828
It's not a date, okay?
248.247
248.414
I'm just gonna teach him how to make
a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.
251.708
# JOEY
251.876
Well, you might want to make a little extra
because, you know...
254.503
254.671
...you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
255.859
# MONICA
255.859
Mm.
257.047
256.900
**LOL**
258.174
We're not gonna have sex.
260.175
260.343
Okay? Nothing's changed here.
262.177
262.345
He still doesn't want children,
and I still do.
264.680
264.847
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.
284.658
284.826
I got to sit in on a meeting
with the reps from Calvin Klein.
287.327
288.037
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie,
she ordered a ton of it.
291.540
291.708
How was your day?

Hmm.
299.381

Why do you have a copy of The Shining
in your freezer?
304.553

Oh. I was reading it last night
and I got scared, so....
308.557
308.300

310.560
But, uh, you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

we got plenty of room in the freezer.

How often do you read it?
323.739
# JOEY
323.948
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?
326.533
# RACHEL
326.701
Well, um, I guess I read Little Women
more than once.
329.578
329.746
But that's a classic.
What's so great about The Shining?
332.039
# JOEY
332.206
The question should be, Rach,
"What is not so great about The Shining?"
335.876
336.300
**LOL**
337.253
Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing."
All right?
340.922
340.600
**LOL**
341.090
This is, like, the scariest book ever.
342.883

I bet it's way better
than that classic of yours.

I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.
505.253

Okay, just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

But, um, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.
833.456
