We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...
133.340
133.550
...is because, uh, she's not coming.
135.592
# PHOEBE
135.802
What?

Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.
672.545
672.755
But they're too close to the bladder.

Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra

I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

1096.595
Well, I have...
1098.221
1098.430
...and the technical definition is:
1102.183
1102.684
"Two friends who care a lot
about each other...
1106.729
1107.689
...and have amazing sex...
1110.274
1111.500
**LOL**
1112.903
...and just want to spend
more time together."
1116.405
1117.366
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...
1121.327
1121.537
...then we have to get you
my original dictionary.
