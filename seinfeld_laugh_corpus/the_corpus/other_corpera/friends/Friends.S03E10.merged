Oh, sure.
Do you need me to train somebody new?

Excuse me, little one.
I have a very solid backhand.
109.733
# ROSS
109.901
Shielding your face

113.153
113.321
...is not a backhand.
115.364
115.000

I was shrieking...
118.367

# MONICA
154.945
Maybe a Hello Kitty doll?

The ability to walk?

What? Me having a job?
183.599

183.975
No, no. I am against innocent trees
being cut down in their prime...
188.437
188.605
...and their corpses
grotesquely dressed...
191.440
191.608
...in, like, tinsel and twinkly lights.

Hey, Phoebe, listen.
203.368
203.536
You got this all wrong.
205.370
205.538
Those trees were born
to be Christmas trees.
207.581
207.749
They're fulfilling their life purpose
by making people happy.

212.128
Really?

# CHANDLER
215.423
Yes.
217.216
217.717
Yes, and, uh, the trees are happy too...
219.927
220.094
...because for most of them,
it's their only chance to see New York.
224.223
224.700

After you've delivered the drinks,

Gunther, Gunther, please.
I have worked here for two and a half years.
234.316
234.484
I know the empty trays go over there.
237.194
# GUNTHER
237.362
What if you put them here?
240.280
# RACHEL
240.448
Huh.
241.740
242.367
You know, that's actually a good idea.
They'll be closer to the mugs.
245.744
245.912
You know what? You should have
the other waitresses do that too.
249.623
249.000
**LOL**
# GUNTHER
249.791
They already do.
251.041
251.041
Huh?
252.292
252.460
That's why they call it "the tray spot."
254.795

255.296
I always heard them talk about that.
I just thought it was a club they went to.
258.966

# ROSS
270.853
So this must be kind of neat
for you, huh?
274.648
274.816
Your dad tells me
you get a couple of days off school...
277.401
277.568
...and you don't have to sell
those cookies anymore.
280.737
280.900
**LOL**
# SARAH
282.282
Well, I kind of wanted to sell the cookies.
284.533
284.701
The girl who sells the most
wins a trip to Space Camp...
287.452
287.620
...and gets to sit in a real space shuttle.
289.788
# ROSS
289.956
Wow, you really like
all this space stuff, huh?
294.626
# SARAH
294.794
Yeah. My dad says if I'd spend as
much time helping him clean apartments...
298.338
298.506
...as I do daydreaming
about outer space...
301.008
301.175
...he'd be able to afford a trip
to the Taj Mahal.
303.927
# ROSS
304.095
I think you'd have to clean a whole lot
of apartments to go all the way to India.
308.348
# SARAH
308.516
No, the one in Atlantic City.
Dad loves the slots.
311.685
312.400

He says he's gonna double
the college money my grandma left me.

Well, good luck to Dad.
322.237

**LOL**
324.240
Say, how many more boxes
would you have to sell in order to win?
328.910
# SARAH
329.120
The girl who won last year sold 475.
331.268
# ROSS
331.268
Yeah?
333.415

333.583
So far, I've sold 75.

336.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
339.213
Four hundred, huh?
341.298
341.799
Well, that sounds doable.
How much are the boxes?
345.177
# SARAH
345.345
Five dollars a box.
346.511
# ROSS
347.180
And what is second prize?
349.431
349.400
**LOL**
# SARAH
350.266
A 1 0-speed bike.
351.558

But I'd rather have something
my dad couldn't sell.

355.000

# ROSS
357.106
Well, that makes sense.

365.365
The astronauts from the space shuttle
are gonna be on the news.

368.451
Since we don't have a TV,
the lady across the alley...

You keep the old ones in the back?

That is so ageist.

No, but there's coconut
in the Hanukkah Menorah-eos.

One, and that's it.
544.793
544.961
I started gaining weight
after I joined the Brown Birds.

557.900
**LOL**
560.059
But, you know,
I'm sure that's not gonna happen this time.
564.854

Why don't I just put you down
for three Mint Treasures...
567.649

I mean, I would give anything to work
for a designer, you know, or a buyer.

657.490
Ugh. I just don't wanna be 30
and still work here.
660.659

Do you know why I'm a terrible waitress?
Because I don't care.
686.893
687.353
I don't care. I don't care which pot
is regular and which pot is decaf.
690.647

I don't care where the tray spot is.
