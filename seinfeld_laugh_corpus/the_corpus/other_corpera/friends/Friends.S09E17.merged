Let me just finish this.

# JOEY

Hey, Ross. Check this out.
8.966
10.200
**LOL**
13.680
Yeah, I can't do that. Heh.
15.431

**LOL**
# CHANDLER
16.850
What are you doing?
17.830
# ROSS
17.830
Have you seen this?
18.809
18.977
It's our new alumni website for college.
21.395
21.604
You can post messages for people,
let everyone know what you're up to.
25.315
# CHANDLER
25.525
Oh, great. A faster way to tell people
that I'm unemployed and childless.
29.903
29.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
30.113
It's actually interesting to find
out what people are doing.
33.073
33.241
Remember Andrea Rich?
34.700
# CHANDLER
34.909
Tall girl, wouldn't sleep with you?
35.972
# ROSS
35.972
Uh-huh.
37.036
37.245
Well, her Internet company went under,
and she lost an ear in a boating accident.
41.999
# CHANDLER
43.334
Bet she'd sleep with you now.
45.836
45.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
47.255
No, I already e-mailed her.
49.590
49.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
51.009
Let me see what you wrote
about yourself.
52.760
52.927
Oh.
54.971
54.971
"Doctor of paleontology, two kids."
57.014
57.223
Wait a second. You split with Carol
because you had different interests?
60.809
60.977
I think you split with Carol because
you had one very similar interest.
65.230
64.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
66.357
You know what? I'm gonna finish this later,
okay? Let me just grab my coat.
69.443
# JOEY
69.611
Okay.
71.278
72.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
74.199
What, did you think you learned how
to do it in the last two minutes?
77.326
77.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
81.623
Maybe we finish this for him.
84.291
86.700
**LOL**
89.047
Also, I cloned a dinosaur in my lab.
92.841
93.551
She is now my girlfriend.
96.220
95.900
**LOL**
97.472
I don't care what society says,
it's the best sex I've ever had.
101.809
102.500
**LOL**
103.311
And send.
105.459
# JOEY
105.459
No, no-- You can't do that to him.
107.606
# ROSS
107.774
All right, let's go.
108.775
# JOEY
108.775
Dude!
109.775
# ROSS
109.943
Uh, I think you made it clear you can't be
trusted with the ball inside the house.
114.446
117.500

# RACHEL

Hey. How was basketball?
166.498
# JOEY
166.708
It was fun. Right up until Chandler
got a finger in the eye.
169.585
# RACHEL
169.752
Oh, no. Who did that?
171.670
# JOEY
171.838
Chandler. Yeah.
174.173
173.100

177.385
Rach?
177.989
177.989
Yeah?
178.594
178.803
What's Huggsy doing
in the crib with Emma?
181.763
181.800
**LOL**
# RACHEL
182.432
She was just crawling around
and she found him...
184.558
184.726
...so I just let her sleep with him.
187.102
187.270
That's all right, isn't it?
189.125
# JOEY
189.125
Of course. Yeah.
190.981
191.149
It's a stuffed animal, you know?
It's for kids. Not for adults.
196.403
196.571
I know that.
198.280
197.800
**LOL**
# RACHEL
198.489
Joey, you're sure? I mean,
I know how much you love him.
201.366
# JOEY
201.534
Rachel, let's be clear on this, okay?
I do not love Huggsy.
206.747
206.998
I like him a normal amount.
209.750
210.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
211.044
All right. Well, Emma loves him.
213.503
# JOEY
213.713
Yeah. Well, why wouldn't she?
He's a wonderful person.
217.132

Hi.
223.368
# MONICA
223.368
Hey, Phoebe. How you doing?
224.890
225.058
You feeling better?
226.705
# PHOEBE
226.705
Breaking up sucks.
228.352
228.519
Oh, I really miss Mike.
230.438
# CHANDLER
230.438
Oh, I'm so sorry.
232.356
# PHOEBE
232.565
I've tried everything to feel better.
I even tried writing a song about it...
236.360
236.527
...but I can't think of anything
that rhymes
238.779
241.000
**LOL**
242.700
Hey, Monica, I'm gonna need
your help getting through this.
245.619
# CHANDLER
245.828
You're saying you're
not gonna need my help?
247.996
# PHOEBE
248.206
No. When I get to the point
where I'm ready...
250.415
250.583
...to hear cruel, mocking jokes
about Mike, I'm gonna come to you.
253.961
253.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
254.128
Oh, good, because I've already thought
of three. Four! I just thought of a fourth.
258.090
# PHOEBE
259.133
Okay. I mean,
I know I did the right thing.
261.635
261.844
Mike never wants to get married...
263.345
263.513
...and I shouldn't be in a relationship
that has no future.
266.556
266.724
But pretty soon,
I'm gonna miss him so much...
269.059
269.227
...I'm gonna want to see him again,
and you have to stop me.
272.187
# MONICA
272.397
Okay, you got it.
274.648
# PHOEBE
276.651
Unless....
Am I being too crazy about this?
280.070
280.238
All right, so, you know,
there's no future.
282.030
282.198
But that doesn't mean
we still can't have fun.
285.075
285.451
You know what? Forget what I said.
287.224
# MONICA
287.224
Really?
288.996
289.163
All right, if that's what you want.
291.019
# PHOEBE
291.019
That was a test, and you just failed.
292.874
293.200

293.918
Damn it! Rookie mistake.
296.920

# CHANDLER
306.180
I believe I read that somewhere.
308.849
308.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
309.600
Not only is it not funny,
it's physically impossible. Okay?
312.436
312.603
Depending on the species, I'd have
to have a 6-foot-long-- It's not funny!
317.774
317.000
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
319.068
I respectfully disagree.
321.570
# ROSS
321.779
I can't believe you put that
on my alumni page.
324.114
# CHANDLER
324.324
Who cares? Nobody reads those.
325.637
# ROSS
325.637
You better hope not...
326.950
327.160
...because I just read what
you put on your page.
329.411
# CHANDLER
329.620
I don't have a page.
331.288

and innocent, sleeping like an angel.

With Emma's chubby little hands
wrapped around you.
359.191

What are you doing?
375.374
# JOEY
375.374
Well, I heard Emma stirring...
376.792
376.959
...so I came in to make sure
she could reach Huggsy.
380.003
380.300
**LOL**
# RACHEL
380.171
Oh. Oh, thanks. All right, well, now that
I'm up, I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
385.217
# JOEY
385.385
Okay, there you go, sweetie.

This isn't over.

**LOL**
# MONICA
395.895
Wait a second. Why would
Ross tell everyone in your class...
398.980
399.190
...that you are
"as gay as the day is long"?
403.026
402.900
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
403.986
Because I told everyone
he slept with dinosaurs.
407.155
407.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
407.782
Well, that's clearly a joke.
This could easily be true.

Would you get that, please? People have
been calling to congratulate me all day.

Yeah. Well, it came
as quite a shock to me too.

430.800
**LOL**
432.515
Well, I guess I should've known. Yeah.
434.099
434.267
He just kept making me watch
Moulin Rouge.

437.353
Hang up. Hang up.
438.979
439.147
And that was a great movie.
441.106
442.000
**LOL**
443.067
I'm so gonna get back at Ross.
445.861
446.028
Oh, yeah, this'll show him. Here we go.
448.405
# MONICA

Oh, please. Hit by a blimp?

It kills over one Americans every year.

# ROSS
478.227
Unbelievable. My classmates
are gonna think I'm dead.
481.521
481.689
My professors. My parents
are gonna get phone calls.
484.774
484.942
You're messing
with people's feelings here.
486.943
# CHANDLER
487.153
You wanna talk about people's feelings?
488.695
488.863
You should have heard how hurt
Professor Stern was...
490.989
491.157
...when I told him I wouldn't be able
to go with him to Key West!
494.159
494.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
495.828
You've really crossed a line here.
But that's okay.
498.705
498.873
Because I'm on my way
to buy some Photoshop software...
501.666
501.834
...and a stack of gay porn.
503.418
503.586
That's right. Your coming-out
is about to get real graphic!

I gotta call him. Just to talk to him.
There's no harm in that.

# MONICA
528.069
Phoebe, that's how it starts.
529.778
529.946
"I don't need to eat the cake,
I'll just smell the icing.
533.448
533.400
**LOL**
533.616
Why not just a little sliver?"
Or, "Okay, just a slice or two."
537.827
537.995
You know, the next thing you know,
you're 21 0 pounds...
540.163
540.331
...and you get wedged in going
down the tunnel slide.
543.083
543.100
**LOL**
545.169
Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard.
546.920
547.088
But look, if you talk to him,
then you're gonna want to see him.
550.340
550.508
And if you see him, you're gonna
wanna get back together.
553.260
553.427
And I know that's not what you want.
556.179
557.598

The new Huggsy. Huh?
645.977

The other Huggsy, I don't know,
I guess I'll just take him back.

649.899
You know what? When I was a little girl,
I had a little pink pony named Cotton.

Oh, I loved her so much. I took her
everywhere. I would braid her tail

659.617
Make the transfer!
661.576
661.500

Should I be concerned that a button fell
off the old Huggsy and I can't find it?

Don't worry about it.
I swallowed that years ago. Hey.

708.269
Oh.
709.499
709.667
Well, when you get over this breakup,
we need to go shopping.
712.794
712.500
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
713.379
Look, Monica, I really appreciate
you checking in on me.
716.423
716.590
But I'm actually feeling a lot better.
717.820
717.820
You are?
719.050
719.218
Yeah, I just kind of want
to be alone right now.
721.678
# MONICA
724.265
Who's that?
726.350
# PHOEBE
726.350
I ordered Chinese food.
728.435
729.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
730.646
What are the chances?
733.398
733.000
**LOL**
733.983
One billion Chinese people,
and they send Mike!
737.819
737.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
742.783
What are you doing here?
743.929
# MIKE
743.929
Phoebe called me.
745.076
# MONICA
745.327
Phoebe!
746.578
# PHOEBE
746.578
I'm sorry. I broke down.
747.829
747.997
I wanted to see him.
749.289
# MONICA
749.457
Damn it, Phoebe,
how did you even call him?
751.583
# PHOEBE
751.792
There's a speakerphone
on the base unit.
754.043
# MONICA
754.253
Base unit. Think, Monica, think!
757.630
757.100
**LOL**
# MIKE
757.882
Look, if I want to see Phoebe, and she--
759.508
# MONICA
759.508
This doesn't concern you.
761.134
761.900
**LOL**
# MIKE
762.595
Sorry. I guess I was thrown off
by the mention of my name.
765.972
766.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
767.725
Look, guys, you can't do this.
769.934
770.102
It's gonna make getting
over each other harder.
772.479
# PHOEBE
772.646
Not if nothing happens.
Why can't we just hang out as friends?
776.816
# MONICA
778.360
Sure. If you're just gonna hang out
as friends, then maybe I'll join you.
782.113
782.323
I'm your friend and Mike's friend.
783.948
784.450
Well....
785.658
786.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
788.287
Sit down.
790.413
# MONICA
792.333
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Make room for your friend.
795.877
795.700
**LOL**
# MIKE
806.263
So how have you been?
807.680
# MONICA
807.680
I've been pretty good.
809.098
808.900
**LOL**
# MIKE
813.896
You look really beautiful.
815.876
# PHOEBE
815.876
Thanks. You look good too.
817.857
# MONICA
818.025
No, no, no. This is dangerous territory.
Keep it clean.
822.403
822.400
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
824.031
So how's the piano playing going?
825.615
# MIKE
825.783
Actually, I've been playing a lot
of love songs lately.
828.743
829.370
I've missed you.
831.309
# PHOEBE
831.309
I've missed you too.
833.248
# MONICA
835.960
You know, on the way over here,
I saw this drunk guy throw up.
840.880
840.800
**LOL**
842.258
And then a pigeon ate it.
844.259
845.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
849.014
Hey. Ross.
850.515
850.933
Look, I just wanted to apologize.
853.560
854.144
Don't tell me you actually made
those gay pictures of me.
857.397
# ROSS
857.565
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Check this out.
860.525
# CHANDLER
860.734
So that's what I'd look like
if I worked out.
863.570
864.697
And was being serviced by a policeman.
867.365
867.100
**LOL**
868.450
You're not gonna actually
send these out, are you?
870.618
# ROSS
870.828
Actually, I don't need to, because your
little "Ross is dead" joke didn't work.
874.789
874.957
Okay? There were no responses.
876.708
876.876
Nobody posted anything on the website,
nobody called my parents...
879.627
879.795
...so the joke, my friend, is on you.
881.504
881.672
Nobody called, nobody wrote anything,
nobody cares that I'm dead.
886.301
888.100
**LOL**
890.598
Oh, my God.
892.223
892.391
Nobody cares that I'm dead?
894.267
894.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
894.267
Oh, come on, you know that's not true.
896.144
# ROSS
896.312
What are you talking about?
You get 60 responses...
898.730
898.898
...just for coming out of the closet.
900.607
900.700
**LOL**
900.774
I didn't get one response, and I'm dead!
904.068
# CHANDLER
904.236
Well, the gay community is a lot more
vocal than the dead community.
908.656
907.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
908.824
I can't believe this. Not even my geology
lab partner. And I carried that guy.
914.704
914.800
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
914.872
All right.
Look, let's think about this, okay?
916.831
916.999
You think people are gonna disturb
your family at this tragic time?
920.168
920.336
That people are gonna post condolences
on a website?
923.004
923.172
This isn't about people
not caring that you're dead.
925.256
925.424
This is about people not having
a decent outlet for their grief.
929.344
# ROSS
930.429
You're right. There isn't a decent outlet.
931.743
# CHANDLER
931.743
Right.
933.056
933.223
Come on. I'm sure if you had a funeral
or memorial service...
935.600
935.768
...tons of people would come.
938.019
# ROSS
938.604
Exactly!
940.563
940.800
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
941.774
Ross, what are you doing?
943.358
944.360
You're having a memorial service
for yourself?
946.611
946.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
947.071
No, that would be stupid.
You're having it for me.
950.156
950.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
951.492
Ross, don't press send. Don't press--
953.577
# ROSS
953.577
No, too late. Too late. It's sent.
955.662
955.829
Sorry, so is that picture
of you and the policeman.
958.790
958.800
**LOL**
# RACHEL
961.043
I'm trying to put Emma down for a nap.
Have you seen Huggsy?
963.836
# JOEY
964.004
Uh, original or crappy?
965.922
966.300
**LOL**
# RACHEL
967.341
Original.
968.612
# JOEY
968.612
No. Sorry. Haven't seen him.
969.884
# RACHEL
970.094
Then what's that big lump
under your covers?
972.804
# JOEY
974.056
It's Monica, okay?
975.745
975.900
**LOL**
# RACHEL
975.745
That's not Monica!
977.433
# JOEY
977.601
All right, fine! It's original Huggsy!
980.937
980.800
**LOL**
982.606
I know Emma wants him,
but he's mine and I need him.
985.149
# RACHEL
# JOEY
985.317
She's being unreasonable.
987.944
987.700
**LOL**
# RACHEL
988.237
Joey, there is a reason that Emma
loves that stupid penguin so much!
991.572
991.782
Oh, don't cover its ears!
993.866
993.000
**LOL**
994.576
It's because it reminds her
of her Uncle Joey.
998.329
# JOEY
999.206
It does?
1000.061
# RACHEL
1000.061
Yeah.
1000.915
1001.083
And she's comforted by him because
she loves her Uncle Joey so much.
1005.962
# JOEY
1006.171
Really? She loves me?
1008.090
# RACHEL
1008.090
Oh, yeah.
1010.008
1010.217
But you know what?
If you need Huggsy, don't worry.
1013.177
1013.345
Emma will totally understand.
I won't, but whatever.
1016.556
1017.200
**LOL**
# JOEY
1016.765
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, Rach.
I mean, if....
1021.310
1021.478
If Huggsy means that much
to Emma, then....
1025.106
1025.524
Well, she can have him.
1026.816
# RACHEL
1027.192
Oh, sweet, I knew Uncle Joey
would step up.
1029.902
1030.279
Look, Emma. Look who's back.
1032.176
# JOEY
1032.176
No, forget it! Forget it! I can't do it!
1034.073
1034.500

# RACHEL
1034.283
Are you--? You're gonna take
Huggsy away from a little child?
1037.160
# JOEY
1037.369
How do you think I got him
in the first place?
1039.746
1039.800
**LOL**
# MONICA
1042.332
All right, you two.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
1044.667
1044.835
I don't want anything going
on while I'm gone.
1046.919
1047.171
Here's a few things you can
1049.130
1049.298
Mucus, fungus, and the idea
of me and Ross doing it.
1053.551
1054.300

# MIKE
1057.097
I've missed you so much.
1058.514
1058.724
I'm not gonna ask you to get back together.
I know we want different things, but....
1062.560
1062.728
Just to be with you one more night.
1064.021
# PHOEBE
1064.021
I want that too.
1065.313
1065.481
But is that gonna make it too hard?
1067.566
# MIKE
1067.566
It can't be any harder than this.
1069.650
1069.860
I mean, if I had known the last time
I saw you would be the last time, I
1073.362
1074.156
I would have stopped to memorize
your face, the way you moved.
1077.158
1077.326
Everything about you.
1079.535
1079.703
If I had known the last time I kissed
you would be the last time...
1083.790
1083.957
...I never would have stopped.
1086.417

What?
1092.132
# MONICA
1092.132
Didn't you hear that speech?

If you don't kiss him, then I will.

1105.395
# MIKE
1105.395
It's my friend Manny.
1107.313

I asked him to keep me away from you.

1111.110
Hey, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe.

# MONICA
1116.073
Excuse me?
1117.136
# MANNY
1117.136
What's with the kissing?
1118.199
# MONICA
1118.408
Hey, at least I knew where my guy was.
1120.952
# MANNY
1121.120
Yeah, thank God you were here
to oversee all the kissing.
1124.288
1124.800
**LOL**
# MONICA
1125.290
You didn't hear the speech.
1126.624
# MANNY
1126.624
I've heard the speech.
1127.959
1128.168
If he knew it was gonna
be the last time
1130.378
1131.100
**LOL**
# MONICA
1130.546
Hey, it was very moving.
You're just heartless!

You're weak!
1134.320

1134.320
You're weird!

Your pants are undone.

Oh!

Damn it.

And I blame you too.

people are gonna get seriously haunted.

Hi. You're Chandler Bing, right?
1186.225
1186.393
I'm Tom Gordon. I was in your class.

# CHANDLER
1188.603
Oh, yes. Yes, let me take your coat.
1190.813
# TOM
1190.981
Thanks. Uh, I'm so sorry
about Ross, it's....
1194.692
# CHANDLER
1194.860
No, at least he died doing what he loved.
1197.528
1197.696
Watching blimps.
1199.989
1199.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
1205.370
Who is it?
1206.621
# CHANDLER
1206.621
You know some guy, Tom Gordon?
1207.872
# ROSS
1208.123
I don't remember him.
1209.498
1209.666
But then again, I touched so many lives.
1213.377
1212.800
**LOL**
# MONICA
1215.672
So did you know Ross well?
1217.215
# TOM
1217.382
Actually, I barely knew him.
I came because I heard Chandler's news.
1220.551
1220.719
Do you know if he's seeing anyone?
1222.637
1222.800
**LOL**
# MONICA
1226.975
Yes, he is. Me.
1230.166

1230.166
What? You mean--? Oh.
1233.356
1233.600
**LOL**
1233.774
Can I ask you a personal question?
How do you shave your beard so close?
1237.985
1239.000
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1240.364
Okay, Tommy!
That's enough mourning for you.
1242.657
1242.824
Here we go. Bye-bye. All right.
1246.202
1244.000

I'm dead and no one cares?

I look like a man?

Please, one ridiculous problem
at a time.
1260.675
1260.800

# ROSS
1260.842
This isn't ridiculous.
Look around, no one's here.
1263.636
# CHANDLER
1263.929
You gave them one day's notice. Not
everyone checks the website every day.
1267.556
1267.724
And Monica, it's probably
the way you stand!
1270.017
1270.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
1272.437
I guess you're right.
Still, somebody must have seen it.
1275.815
1275.983
I mean, I went to that school for four years
and I didn't have an impact on anyone?
1279.986
# CHANDLER
1280.153
Well, that's not true.
You had an impact on me.
1283.447
1283.615
I mean, it's 1 5 years later
and we're still best friends.
1286.325
1286.493
Doesn't that count for something?
1288.911
1291.000

Oh, great, more party boys for Chandler.
1296.585

I'm sure it's somebody for you.
Now go hide.

1314.062
And you are?
1315.438
# CHANDLER
1315.647
Chandler. Chandler Bing.
And I'm not gay. I'm not gay at all.

You are married, though.

Don't listen to him.
He's in a really bad mood.

I can't believe that Ross is gone.
It is just so sad.

I didn't know Ross and you
were so close.

Oh, we weren't. But we had one class
together. He was such a great guy.
1338.127
1338.295
And he talked so passionately
about science.
1341.881
1342.049
I always remembered him.

I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
1345.676
1345.844
And if heaven has a door...
1347.636
1347.804
...I'm sure he's pressing his ear
up against it and listening intently.

I thought so many times about
calling him and asking him out.
1357.438

I guess I really missed my chance.

Kori, I know this
is a big surprise for you.

It's a long story. But the things you
just said really made my day.
1373.871
1374.039
The fact that you're here
means more to me...
1376.207
1376.375
...than if this room were filled
with people.

I can't believe I had a crush on you.

I know it's not something to kid about.

It was just a practical joke between
Chandler and me, but it's over, okay?
1414.870
1415.372
Actually, no. Even if I had died,
you would not be left childless.
