No. I believe that, uh, certain people are
more suited for each other, but....
179.094
178.100

Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
180.617

Good.
181.930
# CHANDLER

What?
190.397
# PHOEBE

I had a date with this guy.

He's tall. He has brown hair.
207.728
# RACHEL
207.728
Of course.
209.333
# CHANDLER
209.542
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!
214.004
213.500
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
214.672
He works with food.
215.964
# RACHEL
215.964
Oh, sure. Older?
217.257
# PHOEBE
217.467
Obviously. And he's British.
218.718
# RACHEL
218.718
I was just gonna ask!
219.968
# PHOEBE
220.178
Yeah? And he's so centered,

# RACHEL
225.892

Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

236.402
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.
239.321
# CHANDLER
239.530
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?
242.491

He may not be my soul mate,

# MONICA

I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.
256.588
# ROSS
256.798
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?
260.884
261.094
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.
264.221

**LOL**
# MONICA
265.223
I know you're hurting...
267.307

...but don't say that again.
269.518
269.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
271.187
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.
275.440
274.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
275.692
You don't need to worry.
277.776
278.027
He'll never tell her how he feels.
280.487
280.738
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.
283.615
# ROSS
283.825
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.
287.828
287.800
**LOL**
# MONICA
288.788
He isn't thinking about going for her.
290.811
# ROSS
290.811
He's not?
292.833
293.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
293.084
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.
296.753
297.005
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.
300.924
# ROSS
301.926
Why?
303.698
# MONICA
303.698
He wants to leave the country.
305.470
305.800
**LOL**
310.059
He thinks you hate him.
311.935
# ROSS
313.146
Hate him?
314.730
316.149
No, I don't hate him.
318.859
321.362
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?
324.281
# MONICA
324.532
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you...
328.618
328.828
...but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.
332.831
333.082
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.
337.461
# ROSS
338.838
Okay, I'll talk to him.
341.757
# MONICA
342.008
I'd do it soon.
343.675
343.926
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

Not really.

You don't believe in soul mates, so....
421.878
# CHANDLER
422.088
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.
426.049

Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

mad at you...
475.599
477.059
...and that I certainly
do not hate you.
480.395
481.564
I just came here to say that.

Hey, wait, Ross?

Okay.
510.425

You need to understand something.

I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?
529.444
529.695
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

Anyway, it'll just....
558.181
558.349
It'll take me a while to get over her.
561.768
562.019
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so....
566.147
# ROSS
566.399
What?
567.899
570.486
You're in love with her?

Yeah. I thought you knew that.
575.637
# ROSS
575.637
Um, no.
577.993
# JOEY
579.829
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.
584.291
584.500
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?
588.878
589.130
But it just keeps getting harder.
593.049
593.259
I don't know what to do, you know?
596.720
598.222
What do I do?
600.348
# ROSS
606.188
You need to tell her how you feel.
609.274

That's the green stuff talking.
612.360
612.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
614.363
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.
617.866
618.117
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.
622.037
# JOEY

But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be
625.415
624.600
**LOL**
# ROSS
625.625
If she is where you are...
628.960

shouldn't stand in the way.

636.218
Are you sure?
637.510
# ROSS
637.510

If she ends up with somebody else...
642.932

she couldn't find a better guy.
647.062

Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

736.777
No, I want the bread.
738.695
738.300

739.321

Look confident.

Joey? What's up?
801.925
# JOEY
802.176
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.
806.554
# RACHEL
806.764
What's up?
807.847
# JOEY
808.224
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?
811.226
811.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
811.435
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?
814.896
# JOEY
815.606
I just came by to tell you that...
818.733
819.109
...I want to have dinner with you.
822.987
# RACHEL
823.197
Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.
825.490
825.490
Okay.
827.784
# JOEY
829.745
Okay. That's good.
831.287
831.580
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.
834.833
835.793
Don't you people ever knock?
838.378
838.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
840.089
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.
842.715
# CHANDLER
842.925
Sure. Set it up.
844.384
844.593
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.
847.846
847.600
**LOL**
# MONICA
848.931
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.
851.349
# CHANDLER
851.600
Yeah. Fine.
852.600
852.852
Not perfect.
854.185
854.395
But good enough.
856.312
856.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
856.730
Jeez, what's with you?
858.398
# CHANDLER
858.607
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?
861.651
862.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
863.112
What's going on?
865.217
# CHANDLER
865.217
Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.
867.323
867.533
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.
870.785
869.400
**LOL**
871.036
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.
876.291
875.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
876.542
You don't believe in soul mates?
879.086
# CHANDLER
879.086
No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.
881.629
880.800
**LOL**
# MONICA
883.048
I don't believe in soul mates, either.
886.050
# CHANDLER
886.260
You don't?
886.906
# MONICA
886.906
Nope.
887.552
887.761
We weren't destined
to end up together.
890.388
890.639
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.
894.225
894.476
Some days we work really hard.
897.145
897.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
897.771
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?
901.983
901.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
902.192
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?
908.197
907.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
908.449
I love you.
909.679
# MONICA
909.679
I know.
910.909
# CHANDLER
911.160
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
913.661
913.829
I found this place that makes the greatest
mozzarella sticks and jalapeֳ±o poppers.
918.291
918.700

No? They taste so good.

It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.
931.846

I'm worried the baby won't like him.

935.200
**LOL**
937.937
Are you okay?
939.583
# JOEY
939.583
Yeah, sure.
941.230
942.358
Uh, look, the reason....
946.736
948.864
Is it hot in here?
950.823
950.600
**LOL**
# RACHEL
951.033
No, not for me.
Why don't you take off your sweater?
954.285
# JOEY
955.204
This is a nice place...
957.246
957.498
...and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

# RACHEL
962.503
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?
966.297
# JOEY
966.507
Yeah, sure.
967.757
# RACHEL
970.594
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.
974.263
973.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
975.557
Uh....
977.058
980.562
How long have we known each other?
982.397
# RACHEL
982.564
Um, seven, eight....
985.233
985.484
Eight years. Wow.
987.527
# JOEY
987.736
Uh-huh. A long time.
988.779

Our specials tonight

# JOEY
1001.083
Could you give us a second?
1002.417
# WAITER
1002.417

1003.751
1003.919
Second's up!
1005.253
1005.800

Not that kind of table.
1012.093

**LOL**
# RACHEL
1015.431
So you were saying?
1016.931
# JOEY
1018.851
I'm not sure.
1020.018
# RACHEL
1020.269
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.
1024.981
1025.274
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half...
1029.652
1030.300
**LOL**
1031.447
...and now here we are.
1033.406

Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.
1072.945

I know this is a lot.
1120.284
1120.536
You don't have to say anything.
1123.788
1124.915
You take as much time as you need.

Okay, you gotta say something.

That's okay. That's fine.

1153.235
It's, uh, pretty much
what I was expecting.
1158.156
1159.575
It's no big deal, all right?

1165.289

Please don't leave like this.

You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

Don't start doing that.
