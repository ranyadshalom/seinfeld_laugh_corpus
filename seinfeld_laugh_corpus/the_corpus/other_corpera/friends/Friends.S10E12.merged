Oh, hey, Joey.

3.669
Mmm.

# JOEY
5.213
Hey.
6.652
# PHOEBE
6.652
Listen, I need to ask you something.
8.090
8.258
You know how my stepdad's in prison?
10.134
# JOEY
10.301
Yeah.
11.343
11.500
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
11.343
Yeah.
12.386
12.554
He was supposed to get a weekend
furlough so he could go to the wedding.
16.598
16.766
But he just called and....
18.934
19.102
Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the
exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.
24.106
24.100
**LOL**
# JOEY
24.607
So he can't come?
25.587
# PHOEBE
25.587
No.
26.567
26.735
And so there's no one to walk me
down the aisle. And....
29.987
30.739
Well, I would just really love it
if you would do it.
33.615
# JOEY
34.743
Seriously?
35.535
# PHOEBE
35.535
Yeah.
36.326
36.494
You've, you know,
sort of been like a dad to me.
39.246
39.900
**LOL**
40.790
You've always, you know, looked out
for me and shared your wisdom.
44.460
# JOEY
47.005
I am pretty "wisdomous."
49.465
49.000
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
50.717
So, what do you say?
52.968
# JOEY
53.136
Are you kidding?
Phoebe, I would be honored.
56.805
# PHOEBE
57.599
Oh, thank you.
59.808
61.269
I hope....
62.728
63.730
I hope you know how much
you mean to me.
66.482
# JOEY
66.941
Listen, I hope....
69.151
69.319
I hope that you know....
71.653
73.782
I don't want you to see your father cry.
Go to your room!
77.493
126.700
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
128.795
Oh.
130.171
# JOEY
130.171
Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.
131.547
132.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
135.385
Oh. It's my wedding planner.
She's driving me crazy!
139.721
139.889
Hello? Okay, stop screaming!
144.601
144.769
Okay, so halibut.
147.396
147.564
All right, so salmon.
Either way. I don't
150.232
150.400
It doesn't matter to me.
151.776
# MONICA
151.776
Well, it matters to me!
153.152
154.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
155.280
Well, I don't care. So you pick.
158.198
# MONICA
158.408
Did you just hang up on me?
160.492
160.500
**LOL**
161.494
All right, look, I need you at the
rehearsal dinner tonight at 1 800 hours.
165.122
# PHOEBE
165.290
Okay. What time is that?
167.457
167.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
168.918
You don't know military time?
170.586
# PHOEBE
170.753
I must have been in missile training
the day they taught that.
173.964
174.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
175.049
Just subtract 1 2.
176.717
# PHOEBE
176.926
Okay, so 1 800 minus 12...
179.469
179.637
...is 1 788.
182.097
181.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
182.265
Six o'clock!
182.786
# PHOEBE
182.786
Okay.
183.307
# MONICA
184.684
Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.
186.226
186.728
No, I said it has to be there
by 4:00. Goodbye.
191.190
191.357
How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?
193.692
# PHOEBE
193.860
That sounds really fancy.
195.485
195.653
I told you, I just want a simple wedding.
198.030
# MONICA
198.198
Please, honey, leave the details to me.
200.908
201.075
Now, I wanna make this day
as special for you as I can.
203.785
203.953
I was thinking the harpist
should wear white.
206.163
# PHOEBE
206.331
Harpist? My friend Marjorie
is playing the steel drums.
209.625
# MONICA
209.792
Oh, she backed out.
211.210
# PHOEBE
211.210
She did? Why?
212.628
# MONICA
212.795
I made her.
214.630
214.200
**LOL**
214.797
Steel drums don't really say
"elegant wedding."
217.049
217.217
Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
218.927
# PHOEBE
218.927
Hey!
220.636
220.803
She will shower when Tibet is free.
223.889
224.100
**LOL**

**LOL**
# CHANDLER
232.148
Hey. You look great.
234.212
# PHOEBE
234.212
You too.
236.276
# CHANDLER
236.444
I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner.
I rarely practice my meals before I eat.
241.531
241.700
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
242.325
What did we say
was your one gift to us?
244.660
# CHANDLER
244.827
No stupid jokes, but I thought
that was for the actual wedding.
248.330
246.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
248.539
Rehearse it.
250.332

Hi.
252.459
# MIKE
252.627
Thanks for coming, you guys.
253.732
# ROSS
253.732
Oh, yeah
254.836
255.046
I was....
I was going for a handshake.
258.507
# MIKE
258.675
That why your hand's
against my crotch?
260.509
# ROSS
260.677
That is why.
261.719
262.000
**LOL**
# MIKE
261.719
Yeah.
262.761
# PHOEBE
264.055
So, Rach, where's Emma?
266.098
# RACHEL
# PHOEBE
# RACHEL
266.266
Monica made me send her
to my mom's.
267.975
268.142
Apparently, babies and weddings
don't mix.
271.019
# MONICA
271.187
Are you still crying about
your damn baby?
274.356
274.100
**LOL**
275.275
Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving.
Remember, 20 seconds per person.
279.027
279.195
You see these clowns all the time.
280.988
281.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
284.492
Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
286.097
286.097
Yes, we are.
287.703
# JOEY
287.870
Gosh, our little ones
are growing up fast, aren't they?
290.706
290.900
**LOL**
292.041
How's that?
292.875
# JOEY
292.875
You know...
293.709
293.876
...on one hand, you're happy for them.
On the other, it's hard to let go.
297.379
298.200
**LOL**
298.298
Who in God's name are you?
300.966
# JOEY
301.384
I'm not that fond of you either, buddy.
I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.
305.721
305.800
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
308.099
You know what? We have no idea what
we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.
312.686
312.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
312.854
I thought we'd be groomsmen.
They would have asked us by now.
315.731
316.300
**LOL**
315.898
When did they ask you
to be a bridesmaid?
318.400
# RACHEL
318.609
November.
320.673
# ROSS
320.673
I wanna say it's not looking good.
322.738
322.300
**LOL**
# RACHEL
323.072
Hey, Pheebs?
323.989
# PHOEBE
323.989
Huh?
324.906
# RACHEL
325.074
You haven't told these guys
what they're doing in the wedding yet.
328.702
# CHANDLER
# PHOEBE
328.870
Um, well, they're not in the wedding.
331.413
# ROSS
331.622
What?
333.248
# RACHEL
337.211
Well...
338.879
339.255
...this is really awkward.
341.590
341.200
**LOL**
342.091
Oh, and I can leave.
344.426
# PHOEBE
345.428
I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got
his brother and his friends from school.
349.931
350.099
So, you know, you were....
352.100
352.268
If it helps, you were next in line.
You just missed the cut.
356.688
356.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
356.898
Oh, man.
358.231
# CHANDLER
358.399
This is like figure skating team
all over again.
361.651
362.700
**LOL**
364.155
I mean, synchronized swimming.
366.573
366.500
**LOL**
366.741
I mean--
I mean, the balance beam.
369.743
369.911
Help me.
370.577
# ROSS
370.577
Football.
371.244

Thank you.

Oh, Pheebs, spit that out.
That has pork in it.
375.916
# PHOEBE
376.084
Oh! Oh!
377.459
377.752
I thought the pot stickers
were supposed to be vegetarian?
380.545
# MONICA
380.713
Yeah, I changed them.
I sent you a fax about it.
383.632
384.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
383.800
I don't have a fax machine.
386.176
# MONICA
386.636
Huh. Well, then there are gonna be
a few surprises.
389.971
390.000

# ROSS
392.266
I can't believe we're gonna be
the only people not in the wedding.
395.435
# CHANDLER
395.603
I know. I hate being left out of things.
397.375
# ROSS
397.375
And it's a wedding.
399.147
399.315
It'll be weird if I'm not in it.
402.067
402.200
**LOL**
# MIKE
403.319
Hey, guys, how's it going?
404.736
# CHANDLER
404.736
Fine.
406.154
406.322
We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing.
It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.
411.201
411.100
**LOL**
# MIKE
411.828
Look, about tomorrow,
I've got a question for you.
414.287
414.455
I found out one of my groomsmen
had an emergency and can't make it.
417.666
# CHANDLER
417.834
What happened?
419.168
# ROSS
419.168
Who cares? And...?
420.502
420.500
**LOL**
# MIKE
421.671
And I was wondering
if one of you guys
423.797
# ROSS
423.965
I'll do it!
425.091
# CHANDLER
425.091
Me!
426.216
426.200
**LOL**
# MIKE
427.009
You both wanna do it?
There's only room for one.
429.511
# CHANDLER
429.720
Pick me. I look great in a tux,
and I won't steal focus.
432.347
433.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
432.515
No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me.
I mean.... Watch.
437.018
438.700
**LOL**
439.605
Huh?
440.856
# MIKE
441.858
You know, I really don't feel
very comfortable making this decision.
445.652
445.820
You know, Phoebe knows you better.
I'm gonna let her choose.
448.989
# ROSS
449.740
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say
hello to Mike's next groomsman.
455.203
455.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
455.830
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...
458.665
458.833
...as he is me.
460.876
460.600
**LOL**
# ROSS
462.128
Please. You're going down.
463.879
# CHANDLER
463.879
You are going "downer."
465.630
# ROSS
465.798
They say that on
the figure skating team?
467.716
# CHANDLER
467.884
I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.
470.635
470.200
**LOL**
# JOEY
473.556
You know I'm filling in
for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?
476.516
# MIKE
476.684
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
478.456
# JOEY
478.456
Oh, hey, my pleasure.
480.228
480.730
So, what are your intentions
with my Phoebe?
483.023
483.000
**LOL**
# MIKE
483.858
I intend to marry her.
485.714
# JOEY
485.714
Oh, a wiseacre.
487.569
488.100
**LOL**
489.572
I understand you plan to support
your wife by playing the piano?
493.700
494.160
Isn't that kind of unstable?
496.411
496.200
**LOL**
# MIKE
496.662
No more so than acting.
498.080
# JOEY
498.080
Strike two.
499.498
499.800
**LOL**
# MIKE
500.583
You're right.
She probably will support me.
503.919
504.086
Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.
506.338
# JOEY
507.590
Strike three.
509.591
509.000
**LOL**
510.259
You only get one more, Mike.
512.093
512.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
515.181
So? What did you decide?
518.016
# PHOEBE
518.309
I decided to pee.
520.727
520.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
521.521
You have to choose one of us
to be in your wedding.
524.397
524.565
One of the groomsmen fell out.
525.754
# PHOEBE
525.754
Oh, no, no.
526.942
527.109
I can't choose between you two.
I love you both so much.
530.737
# CHANDLER
530.905
Just not enough to put us
in the original wedding party.
534.574
534.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
535.076
But I don't wanna choose.
It's....
537.452
537.703
Okay, wait. Rach?
538.641
538.641
Yeah?
539.579
539.747
Listen, I have a very special
bridesmaid task for you to do.
543.124
# RACHEL
543.459
Goody! What is it?
545.252
545.400
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
545.419
Well, there's a spot open
for only one groomsman...
547.796
547.964
...and you have to choose between Ross
and Chandler. So good luck with that.
551.633
552.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
551.842
What? What, what, what?
No, I don't wanna do that.
554.553
# PHOEBE
554.720
I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.
556.638
# ROSS
556.806
I'll do it!
558.557
558.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
558.766
Okay, it's 21 00 hours.
560.809
560.977
Time for your toast.
562.436
# MIKE
562.436
Do I have time to go to the bathroom?
563.895
# MONICA
564.063
You had a bathroom break at 2030.
Pee on your own time, Mike.
568.358
568.800
**LOL**
570.486
In regards to the toasts, okay,
you wanna keep them short.
573.405
573.573
Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner
like long speeches. Okay.
576.575
576.742
You just get in, do your thing,
and get out.
579.077
# MIKE
579.245
Is that what you say to Chandler?
580.996
581.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
582.748
It's 21 01 , and I am not amused.
585.500
586.200
**LOL**
586.877
Okay.
588.461
588.629
The bride and groom
have a few words they'd like to say.
592.632
# PHOEBE
594.468
Okay. Hello, everyone.
596.636
596.804
And thank you all for being here tonight.
So tomorrow's the big event.
600.932
601.183
Some of you might not know, but Mike
and I didn't get off to the best start.
605.270
605.479
Yeah. My friend Joey and I...
608.815
608.983
...decided to fix each other up
with friends. So I
613.361
614.800
**LOL**
615.698
Oh, okay. I....
618.199
618.367
I thought about it, and I fixed him up
with my friend Mary Ellen...
621.536
621.704
...who couldn't be here tonight,
because.... It's not
625.498
624.700
**LOL**
625.666
It's not important.
Well, she's in rehab.
628.293
628.200
**LOL**
628.919
Anyway. So Joey said that he was
fixing me up with his friend Mike...
633.673
633.841
...only he didn't have a friend Mike,
so he just brought my Mike. And-- And
638.053
639.500
**LOL**
640.056
But despite, you know--
It got good.
643.391
644.100
**LOL**
645.353
I wanna take a moment to mention
my mother, who couldn't be here.
648.855
649.023
Oh, God.
650.732
650.600
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
650.941
And.... And moment's over.
653.151
653.319
So okay.... Oh, no, forget that.
656.321
656.489
I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.
658.573
658.741
Oh, but you need to know that

Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!

670.700
**LOL**
671.587
This is my wedding, okay?
I don't want this
675.507
675.675
Or this-- Or this
678.176
678.344
Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...
680.595
680.763
...where my fiancֳ© can go
to the bathroom any time he wants!
684.057
685.000

Joey, listen, this is gonna be
bridesmaid central, all right?
712.460
712.628
We're gonna have hair and makeup
in the bathroom.
715.004
715.214
I had to move a couple things in the
fridge to make room for the corsages.
718.758
# JOEY
718.926
Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast
if I knew there was gonna be corsages.

Hi.
728.309
729.145
About last night....
731.479
731.647
I know you're under
a lot of stress, and....
734.315
734.483
Well, even though the things you said
hurt me a little bit....
738.653
740.448
My point is....
741.948
742.116
Well, I'm willing to take my job back.
744.659
# PHOEBE
745.828
Oh, well, that's okay.
748.121
748.600
**LOL**
749.039
I think you and I will do much better
if you're just here as a bridesmaid.
753.334
# MONICA
754.336
Oh, is that so?
757.213
757.381
Okay.
758.715
758.883
If that's really what you want,
then here.
761.342
761.510
I give you the headset. I don't really
wanna give you the headset.
764.679
765.500
**LOL**
765.890
I guess if you're taking over, then you
should probably return these messages.
770.393
# PHOEBE
770.561
This is a lot.
771.687
# MONICA
771.687
Uh-huh.
772.812
772.980
But I'm sure you can handle this.
I have won awards...
775.857
776.025
...for my organizational skills.
But I'm sure you'll do fine.
779.194
# PHOEBE
779.361
You've won awards?
781.071

# MONICA
787.348
She's in her room. Why?
788.328
# ROSS
788.537
I have to talk to her
about this groomsman situation.
791.039
791.207
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there
while I'm in the seats like some chump.
794.876

# RACHEL
811.894
Ross, please don't make this
harder than it already is.
814.521

I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.
817.565

Chandler said it's important to him too.
820.173
# ROSS
820.173
Listen. Listen.
821.903
822.238
Whoever you pick is gonna
walk down the aisle with you.
825.865
826.033
Now, I promise I won't say a word.
But if you pick Chandler...
829.577
829.745
...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes
in your ear the whole time.
833.331
833.200

Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.

# PHOEBE
843.342
Sven, I don't understand what you're
saying. What is wrong with the flowers?
847.262
847.429
"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?
849.764

Mike, if you were Swedish...
854.769

...and you were saying the word
"lorkins," what flower would that be?
858.439
# MIKE
858.941
Orchids?
859.712
# PHOEBE
859.712
Right there!

Have a seat.
894.809
897.813
Last night...
899.606
900.274
...I tried to welcome you into my family.
903.902
903.800
**LOL**
905.905
And instead, you disrespect me.
909.699
909.909
I cannot allow this.
911.534

# MIKE
912.411
Are you rehearsing
for some really bad Mafia movie?

More back talk.
918.166
919.043
And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines
from my recent unsuccessful audition...
924.464
924.632
...for Family Honor 2:
This A-Time It's A-Personal.
928.301

What do you want?
933.306
# JOEY
933.474
I want you to take this seriously!
935.642
935.809
Phoebe is very,
very important to me, okay?
938.978
939.146
I wanna make sure
you are gonna take care of her.
941.564
# MIKE
943.317
Joe, I love Phoebe.
945.526
945.694
She's the most important thing
in my life.
947.862
948.030
I'd die before I let
anything happen to her.
951.074
# JOEY
952.701
That's what I wanted to hear.
955.828
955.500
**LOL**
956.163
Because she's family, okay?
958.831
958.999
And now you're gonna be family.
960.833
961.001
And there's nothing more important
in the whole world than family.
966.172
# MIKE
966.382
That must have been one lousy movie.

Hi.

# CHANDLER
975.098
Let's talk about this groomsman thing.
976.349
976.517
If you pick Ross, he'll walk you
down the aisle just fine.
979.394
979.561
But if you choose me...
981.521
981.689
...you'll be getting some comedy.
984.065
984.100
**LOL**
# RACHEL
986.235
Even so...
988.778
989.100
**LOL**
991.740
...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.
993.950
# CHANDLER
994.118
Let me tell you
why you need to pick me.
995.910
996.078
Okay.
997.245
998.414
See, when I was a kid, you know,
I was always left out of everything...
1003.251
1003.419
...and it really made me feel insecure.
1006.462
1006.630
I was always picked last in gym...
1010.633
1010.801
...even behind that fat exchange student
who didn't know the rules to baseball.
1014.762
1014.930
I mean, this guy would strike out
and then run to third.
1018.641
1019.200
**LOL**
1021.020
Anyway, if I'm the only one
left out of this wedding...
1023.980
1024.148
...I just know that all those feelings
are gonna come rushing back.
1028.317
# RACHEL
1030.612
All right, fine, I pick you.
1032.655
# CHANDLER
1032.823

No, we're gonna do it my way.
Because your way is stupid.

I have another call, Reverend.

the wedding night advice.

uncomfortable at all.

1076.658
Oh, my God, what's it doing here?
1078.701
# MONICA
1078.869
I guess it got sent to the billing address
as opposed to the shipping address.

What a pickle.

1127.376
I'm not supposed to tell you.

we could be in the wedding?

# MIKE
1157.281
Oh, you haven't picked yet?
Oh, good, because I had an idea.
1160.408
1160.576
I thought it would be fun if the third
groomsman was my family dog, Chappy.
1165.580
1165.700

# ROSS
1165.789
What? A dog?
No. Rachel gets to choose.

are there but the bartender is not?

The blizzard.

...it's the worst snowstorm
in 20 years.

They already closed
all the bridges and tunnels.

1269.476
It's so beautiful out there. You always
wanted to get married outside.

Why don't you just do it on the street?
1275.002

# RACHEL
1276.483
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore.
