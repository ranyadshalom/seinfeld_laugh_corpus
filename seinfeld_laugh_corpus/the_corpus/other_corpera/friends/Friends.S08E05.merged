# PHOEBE

Oh. So you're Monica's boss?
23.064
# TIM
23.064
Actually, she's my boss.
24.732

"Sous" is French for "under."

Ah! I "sous-stand." Heh.

# MONICA
29.612
Tim, I need a calamari and a caesar salad.
And could you get me the pesto?
33.032
# TIM
33.199
Yeah.
34.200
# PHOEBE
34.200
You made pesto?
35.200
# TIM
35.368
Yes, I did.
36.577

Would you say your pesto
is the best-o? Heh.

40.040
I don't know.
I would say it's pretty good-o.

# MONICA

I still need the calamari and the salad.
48.047
# TIM
48.214
I like your necklace.
49.298
# PHOEBE
49.298
Oh, I made it myself.

You are so talented.

Well, it's no pesto.

Okay? You're single, you're single.

He gets off work at 1 1 .
She'll be waiting for your call.

I'll give him your number if I could
just get calamari and caesar salad!

168.200
**LOL**
168.960
The first time, we were passing each other
so I didn't say anything.
172.296
172.463
The next time he said,
"Hey, Toby, want a doughnut?"
175.883
176.050
And I wanted the doughnut.
179.386
177.700
**LOL**
179.554
Five years later, the doughnut's gone
and I'm still Toby.

Five years? Chandler, you have to tell him.
185.768
# CHANDLER
185.768
No, that would be so awkward.
187.853
188.021
Besides, we work in different departments.
He's on the sixth floor.
191.148
191.316
So he calls me Toby once in a while.
Big deal. Could be worse.
194.443
194.611
It's not like he's calling me Muriel.
197.446
196.800

# ROSS

Muriel.
Why would he call you Muriel?

Drake, I've discovered the reason
for your headaches and memory loss.
234.441
234.609
What is it?
235.692
235.860
Apparently, your brain transplant
was not entirely successful.
239.071
239.239
It seems your body
is rejecting Jessica's brain.
241.907
242.075
Is it serious?
244.326
244.000
**LOL**
244.494
Not if we extract tissue
from the original body...
246.995
247.163
...synthesize antibodies,
introduce them into your system...
249.915
250.083
...which could stop you
from rejecting the brain.
253.085
253.253
That sounds simple enough.
Let's just do that.
256.964
256.400
**LOL**
257.131
We would, but when we went
to exhume Jessica's body...
260.968

...it was gone.

341.194
# PHOEBE
341.194
Why?
342.591
# MONICA
342.759
Because He's terrible.
He's slow. He burns things.
346.178
346.346
Last night he lit my pastry chef on fire.
348.972
348.900
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
349.140
He was nervous.
You can be very intimidating.
352.517

And I've met your pastry chef.
She can stand to be taken down a peg.
356.521
# MONICA

Well, now she has no eyebrows.
Mission accomplished.
360.067
359.800

But Monica, he loves his job so much.

364.197
Can't you just give him
another chance, please?
367.157
# MONICA
369.327
All right. But if he lights someone
else on fire, he is out of there.
372.496
# PHOEBE

That's fair. Thank you so much. Thanks.
376.750

chef, he got you a little bit too.

I didn't. I didn't know

But
511.927
# MONICA

No! No, no. He's totally incompetent.
514.137
514.305
I called the chef
who recommended him to me.

He said, "Ha, ha! Gotcha!"

"Did you get home from work okay?
Did you get out of the shower okay?"
534.950
# MONICA
535.117
Just don't pick up your phone.
536.555
# PHOEBE

"I was worried about you."
Ugh, be a man!

**LOL**
# MONICA
542.083
So now I'm not allowed to fire him?
544.000
# PHOEBE
544.168
You can't fire him and dump him
in the same day. He'll kill himself.
547.504
# MONICA
547.672
I fire him today,
you go out with him another week.
550.131
# PHOEBE

Are you kidding? Another week
with that simp, I'll kill myself.
554.219

Then we'll both do it today

What do you think is the better excuse
for why I'm not drinking on this date?
611.526
611.694
Um, "I'm a recovering alcoholic,"
"I'm a Mormon"...
615.196
615.364
...or "I got so hammered last night
I'm still a little drunk"?
618.950

# JOEY
# ROSS
621.370
So, what do you want to do tonight?
623.913
624.081
There's a Ukrainian film at the Angelika
that's supposed to be very powerful.
627.626
627.793
Interested?
628.773
# JOEY
628.773
No. No.
629.753
629.600
**LOL**
629.920
But I'll go see
a normal-person movie with you.
632.881
# ROSS
633.049
Rach, you wanna come?
634.821
# RACHEL
634.821
Oh, no, I can't. I got a date.
636.593
# ROSS
637.136
Heh. A date?
639.096
# RACHEL
639.096
Yeah. Why, is that weird for you?
641.056
# ROSS
641.223
Why, no. It's the opposite of weird.
It's, uh-- It's regular. It's, uh
646.144
646.312
It's mundane. It's actually a little dull.
650.440
# JOEY
650.608
It's no Ukrainian film, I'll tell you.
653.526
653.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
653.694
Ooh! Earrings!
655.904
# ROSS
656.614
A date? She's got a date? With who?
659.512
# JOEY
659.512
I set her up with this actor on my show.
662.410
# ROSS
662.578
You set her up?
664.517
# JOEY
664.517
No.
666.456
666.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
667.458
Joey, what were you thinking?
669.000
# JOEY
669.000
That it would probably be okay...
670.543
670.711
...because Ross hasn't gone out
with Rachel in five years.
673.755
674.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
673.923
Joey, I'm not worried about her.
I'm worried about my baby.
676.883
677.051
Whoever she dates, my baby dates.
679.636
679.804
Where is this "actor" taking them?
682.118
# JOEY
682.118
Hey! I'm an "actor" too.
684.432
685.000
**LOL**
686.811
I'm not sure. I think they're taking the ferry
to some Italian place on Staten Island.
690.814
# ROSS
690.981
A ferry? My baby's going on a ferry?
694.693
694.400
**LOL**
694.860
Do you have any idea
how dangerous those are?
697.195
# JOEY
697.363
Aren't we talking about those big boats
that go, like, five miles an hour?
701.533
701.100
**LOL**
# ROSS
701.701
Why don't they just jump out
of an airplane? That's a fun date.
704.619
704.787
Or burn each other with matches?
That's fun too.
706.621
706.789
Whoo!

Whoops! So sorry. "This just in." Heh.
775.273
775.800

777.651
It's 91 1 from the restaurant.
That means Monica needs me.
780.361
# PHOEBE
780.529
Oh, no, she doesn't! I know what that is.
You can stay.

I'll miss you too, Pheebs.

# JOEY
800.132
So, what movie do you wanna see?
And not another one I have to read.
803.468
803.636
I get enough of that from books.
805.553
805.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
807.640
Books?
809.245
# JOEY
809.245
All right, car magazines, cereal boxes...
810.850
811.018
...but it's, like, enough!
812.644
812.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
813.562
I tell you what, why don't we--?
815.230
815.397
Why don't we stay. Let's not see a movie.
We'll just hang.
818.066
# JOEY
818.234
Just wait for Rachel
to come back from her date?
821.110
# ROSS
821.278
Hey, if that's what you wanna do,
I'm not gonna say no.
824.614
823.900
**LOL**
# JOEY
824.824
Dude, what is going on?
827.534
# ROSS
827.701
I just-- I have to find out how it went.
829.432
# JOEY
829.432
Why?
831.162
# ROSS
831.330
This guy could be my baby's stepfather.
833.414
# JOEY
833.582
They go on one date and you're worried
about them getting married?
836.626
836.794
He's not you.
839.003
838.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
839.755
I just, I can't believe she's dating.
843.216
# JOEY
843.384
What did you think she was gonna do?
845.323
# ROSS
845.323
I don't know.
847.262
847.847
I guess I can't believe
any of this is happening.
850.723
# JOEY
851.433
What do you mean?
852.600
# ROSS
852.768
I always thought when I had another kid,
it'd be different.
855.770
857.773
I love Ben. But every time
I drop him off at Carol and Susan's...
863.069
863.237
...it breaks my heart a little.
866.531
867.199
I've always had this picture
of me and my next wife in bed on Sunday.
871.661
871.829
My kid comes running in, leaps up on
the bed and we all read the paper together.
876.833
877.001
You know?
Maybe fight over the science section.
881.129
880.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
881.797
That's a nice picture.
Maybe you can still have that.
884.340
# ROSS
884.508
No, I can't. Rachel's out with some guy.
888.177
888.345
My baby went with her.
890.722
890.500
**LOL**
892.182
If anything, that picture
keeps moving further away.
895.894
# JOEY
897.479
Hey, can I ask you something?
899.647
899.815
In this picture of you and your wife,
is your wife Rachel?
906.029
# ROSS
906.864
It used to be.
908.781
910.284
Now she doesn't really have a face.
913.411
914.663
Smoking body, though.
917.373
917.100
**LOL**
# JOEY
918.959
Good call. But the face, Ross,
the face isn't Rachel.
924.130
# ROSS
924.298
No. But, ugh, how much easier
would it be if it were?
928.426
# JOEY
928.594
I know, but I don't think
that's what she wants.
930.762
# ROSS
930.930
It's not what I want either.
932.263
932.431
And I can't force myself
to fall in love with her again.
935.016
# JOEY
935.184
Ross, maybe you need a new picture.
938.019
938.187
Okay? It's not gonna be what you thought.
But no matter what...
942.982
943.150
...there's gonna be
a brand-new little baby. Your baby.
946.945
947.905
Who cares what the picture looks like?
950.657
# ROSS
951.742
Yeah.

Hey, tell you what. Let's you and me
go out and have some fun.
