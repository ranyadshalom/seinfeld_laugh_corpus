182.140
Emily showed up at the airport.
184.016
184.225
I had to go after her.
I did what I had to do.
187.311

264.264
...so I'm sending 72 long-stemmed, red
roses to her parents' house.
268.392
268.643
One for each day
I've known and loved her.

Ross abandoned me!
294.668
294.877
I couldn't get a plane out.
I had to stay in their suite!
299.089
299.340
People came up to me going,
"Mrs. Geller! Why are you cry?"
304.261
304.800
**LOL**
304.721
I mean, it was so humiliating!
307.973

I felt like such an idiot!
310.309
310.518
It's all my fault. You know why?
312.811

Rachel wants to take
swing dance lessons.
796.753
797.421
Which I think is a really stupid idea.
799.923

It's dangerous.
She won't get what she wants.
