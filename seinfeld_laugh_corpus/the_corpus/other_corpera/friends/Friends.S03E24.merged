Let me tell you a story.
785.658
786.535
When I set out to create MOSS 865,
do you think it happened overnight?
790.872
791.123
No. There was MOSS 1
that burned down my dad's garage.
795.543
795.900
**LOL**
795.795
There was MOSS 2 that would only
schedule appointments in January.
799.714
799.500
**LOL**
799.882
And 862 others that I learned from.
802.217
802.510
Just like I learned from this fight
never to let a guy stand on my neck.
806.221
# MONICA

You didn't know that already?

# PETE
825.241
One other thing.

Hoshi thinks you being ringside
may have affected my concentration.
830.245
# MONICA
831.080
Yeah.
832.247

About five minutes.
843.758

They're interviewing his opponent.

Apparently, he trains by going to Iran

Oh, I gotta tell you,
I wasn't expecting to like her at all.
867.615

I actually wasn't expecting

No, I just didn't do them.

939.188
Instead, I hung out with some
friends and had a couple of beers.
942.857
943.150
So I certainly don't
deserve praise. Verbal...

I'm a little bit uncomfortable with
the way that you express yourself.

# DOUG
966.048
Is it the swearing?
Is it the constant swearing?
968.633

Because I gotta tell you, if it is,
you can just kiss my ass!
972.845
973.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
974.890
No. It's not about the swearing.
It's more about...
977.642
977.893
...the way that you occasionally...
980.353
980.562
...concentrate your enthusiasm...
984.065
985.359
...on my buttocks.

# CHANDLER
989.488
Don't get me wrong,
I appreciate the sentiment.

992.491
It's just that I have a rather
sensitive posterior.
996.327
997.200

And besides, it's making
all the other guys jealous.
