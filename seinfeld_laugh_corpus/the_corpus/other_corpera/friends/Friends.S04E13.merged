Personal Shopping, what is that?

I'm totally screwed, okay? They're gonna be
hot and heavy on-stage every night...
215.464
215.632
...and then they're gonna go to their
cast parties, and he's gonna undermine me.
219.468
219.636
You know, he'll be like, "So where's your
boyfriend? What's his name, Chester?"
223.138
223.200

Chandler, look, they're actors.
They're there to do a job.
238.820
238.988
Just because they work together
doesn't mean they'll get together.
241.615
241.783
Just because it happened
with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins...
244.493
244.661
...doesn't mean it's gonna happen
with them.

Okay, look, look.
Let me ask you a question.
265.180
265.348
When they were doing it on-stage,
was it like really hot?
267.683
# ROSS
267.850
Huh. Oh, yeah.
269.810
269.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
271.020
Well, okay, so then you're fine.
273.313
273.481
Look, the rule is when two actors
are actually doing it off-stage...
277.776
277.944
...then all the sexual tension
between them is gone.
281.280
281.447
Okay? So as long as it's hot on-stage,
you got nothing to worry about.
285.701
285.868
It's when the heat goes away,
that's when you're in trouble.

Not those guys. I'm always the hostess.

I mean, even when I was little, the girls
brought their dollies to my tea party.

Because they took our apartment.
I wanted to punish them.

in bed together.
