I met this girl on a train
going to a museum upstate.
24.440

# ROSS

We were at the back of the train.
32.948
33.199
I sat near the door
so she'd have to pass by me...
36.535
36.786
...if she wanted to switch cars.
She was totally at my mercy.
40.748
# CHANDLER
40.957
Were you so late because
you were burying this woman?
44.251
44.100
**LOL**
# ROSS
44.669
I'm late because
she lives in Poughkeepsie.
47.046
47.255
She seems great,
but she's two and a half hours away.
50.632
# CHANDLER
50.884
How can she be great
if she's from Poughkeepsie? Ha-ha-ha.
54.261

That joke would have killed

I read about this director,

273.021
273.314
...who, at the beginning, would
hire somebody just to fire them.
277.234
277.527
Then they would all know who was boss.

Could the waiters listen
to the specials?
726.975

There's Chilean sea bass
with a mango relish
731.020
