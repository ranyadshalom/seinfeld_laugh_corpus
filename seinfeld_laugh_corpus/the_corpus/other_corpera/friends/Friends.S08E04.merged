75.387
You know what?

Why don't you give us our souvenirs
and get the hell out of here.

We didn't get a chance to--

# MONICA
150.817
So now that Ross knows,
can you tell us how it happened?
153.443

When did it happen?
How many times did it happen?

Start with where.
160.367

**LOL**
# RACHEL
163.204
Well, it happened about six weeks ago.
166.623
166.791
And, uh, I had just got home from work
and Ross was already there.
170.210
170.378
I guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.

And so I had a lot of work, and Ross,
nice guy that he is, offered to help me out.
185.809
185.977
And then we had wine,
we got to talking.
188.770
188.938
Next thing you know,
out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.
192.274
192.500
**LOL**
192.442
Um, heh. That's
194.109

There's the one!

208.700
**LOL**
211.419
You know what? Uh, it's not important.
213.503
213.671
Heh, what's important is
that we're having a baby.
216.048
216.216
It doesn't matter who came on to who.
218.592
# JOEY
218.801
"Whom."

You kissed me first.
228.749
# ROSS

What? You were begging me to kiss you!
230.562
230.813
You were sending me signals
all over the place.

I was sending signals? Please.
234.358

Please, show of hands.

These signals, explain this.
Maybe I need to be more careful.

raise your right hand...

And Joey can back me up on this.
383.673
383.883
About a month and a half ago,
remember I came to you with a problem?

# JOEY
420.336
Sure, yeah.

How about, uh,
you showering with your mom?

428.553
I actually had a topic in mind.
430.762

I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.
440.355

Six months? That's rough.

Well, it's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the, uh, small things in life.

Like the sound of a bird,
or the color of the sky.
458.707

514.514
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.
519.893
521.400
**LOL**
522.396
I was at the end of this path.
I came to a clearing, and there was a lake.
526.942
527.193
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.
531.238
531.489
It was dead silent. Gorgeous.
535.075
535.326
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.
541.248
541.499
But she was crying.

I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.
649.272
649.523
Do what I do
when I'm preparing for an audition.
652.067
652.234
I'll set you up with my video camera.
654.069
654.236
You can record yourself

I'll try that.

When she came in, I got distracted
and totally forgot about the camera.

It kept rolling and recorded everything.

# CHANDLER
725.224
Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
726.850
# MONICA
726.850
Yeah.
728.476

What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.
733.189

This is not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

I don't get why Greg and Jenny
would give us a fake number.

# JOEY
760.134
You know, if they knew
what they were doing...
762.635
762.803
...they didn't give you real names either.
764.492
# MONICA
764.492
Okay.
766.181
765.400
**LOL**
766.390
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but they don't give out fake names.
770.226

# MONICA
781.196
I know.
782.530
784.492
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.
788.036

# CHANDLER
788.871
I thought you said those jokes
were funny. Joke, joke, joke!

Joke, joke...
794.042
798.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER

Maybe it was your questions.
802.030
# MONICA
802.030
What about my questions?
803.551
# CHANDLER
803.719
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.
807.806
808.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
810.267
Ooh, sorry, was that another joke?

818.441
Uh, no, Rach, he's gone, but listen.
819.901
820.069
He told us what happened.
It sounds like an honest mistake.

# RACHEL
823.739
Really? How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?
828.535
828.744
Oh, forget it.

# ROSS
838.671
Look, it was an accident, okay?
841.172
841.340
I feel bad it happened.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.
844.676
844.844
Anyway, here.
847.720
# I 
847.888
I thought you might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.
876.291
876.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
876.458
Forget it. She's destroying it.
878.668
# PHOEBE
878.836
Okay, fine! Fine. We'll just have to think
of some other way...
882.255
882.423
...to put the "who came on to who"
thing to rest.
884.674
884.842
Come on now, think!
887.176
887.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
888.596
Forget it. It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants with it.
892.891
893.058
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.
897.562
# RACHEL
897.813
I want to see it.

Clearly you don't want people
to see this tape.
904.027
904.194
I don't want people
to see this tape either.
906.195
906.363
But you so badly don't want people to see
it that it makes me want to see it. See?
910.575
911.000

912.703
Are we watching the tape or not?

I screwed up so bad.
971.636

I told Monica that I'd stuff and send
those wedding invitations weeks ago.
977.141
# ROSS
977.309
You didn't do it?
978.476
# RACHEL
978.644
I had put them in--
ln my desk at work...
981.187
981.355
...and I forgot about them until today.

Sweetie, it's okay.
Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.

I can not believe that I did this.
999.122

Especially after Monica
just went on and on and on about it.
1003.001
1003.168
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.
Be very careful, Rachel.
1007.588
1007.756
Please drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."

# RACHEL
1055.387
Oh, I remember how we almost.
1058.389
1059.349
You think we would've gone through with it
if we hadn't gotten caught?
1062.685
1062.853
You think we would have done it?
1065.563
# ROSS
1067.524
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.
1071.903

# ROSS
1174.256
Yeah, listen, about that...
1176.132
1176.300
...the whole "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.
1180.219
1180.387
I think it would have happened
either way.
1183.347
1183.515
I mean, if you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.
