851.225
I sure did.
852.642

# CHANDLER
852.852
It made me feel good to do

I'm 29. I mean, who needs
a savings account?

You're the best friend

No, you are.
882.463
882.673
You do this, you give me advice....
885.091
885.301
What you said about
focusing on one woman?
889.178
889.430
I'll do that.
890.513
# CHANDLER
890.931
With Casey?
891.931
# JOEY
892.141
I'll see how things go with Kathy.
She's cool.
895.518
# CHANDLER
895.895
Or Casey.
897.020
# JOEY
897.020
No, Kathy.
898.146
898.300
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
898.314
Could be Casey.
899.314
# JOEY
899.523
No, Kathy.
900.607
# CHANDLER
900.774
Consider Casey.
901.774

**LOL**
# JOEY
903.569
I think somebody's
got a little crush on Casey.

I'll fix you two up.
What do you think?

# ROSS
928.135
Thanks.
929.385
930.471
Monica tells me you don't want
to play anymore because of me...
935.183
935.392
...and, you know, my talent.
937.560
938.100
**LOL**
938.854
Is that true?
939.854
# PHOEBE

Well, kind of, yeah.
942.649
# ROSS
942.649
Pheebs....
943.733
# PHOEBE
943.984
I was trying to be really okay
and upbeat about it...
947.779
947.988
...but I just feel so dwarfed
by your musical gift.
951.532
952.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
953.410
See, but....
954.702
954.954
Pheebs, that is the exact
opposite intent of my music.
959.707
959.959
You know, my music
is meant to inspire.
963.127
963.379
If it bothers you this much...
965.296
965.547
...then I won't play anymore.
969.133
969.700
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
970.928
No, don't do that.
973.054

How could I live if I knew I was
depriving the world of your music?

# ROSS
# MONICA
999.039
What? Are you serious?
1000.373
# PHOEBE
1000.582
Does Joey know?
1001.520
# CHANDLER
1001.520
No.
1002.458
1002.668
Is there any way you think
he will understand this?
1006.421
# MONICA
1007.214
You obviously haven't
screwed over your friends.
1010.717
1010.968
Which we all appreciate.
1012.844
1012.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
1013.762
If you'd told him how you felt
before you kissed her...
1017.682
1017.933
...knowing Joey,
he'd have stepped aside.
1020.435
# CHANDLER
1020.853
Don't say that. That's not true, is it?
1024.647
# PHOEBE
1024.857
Yeah.
1025.649
# MONICA
1025.649
He loves you.
1026.441
# CHANDLER
1026.650
Then why didn't you tell me to do that?
1029.277
1029.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
1029.778
I said something to Phoebe.
1031.904

# RACHEL
1040.622
You'll have to tell him.
1042.290
# CHANDLER
1042.541
Why do I have to?
1044.042
# RACHEL
1044.376
Because you do.

Sambuca Margarita?

1064.646
It that a real thing?

Listen, Joe. I need to
1072.820
1073.072
I need to talk to you.
1074.572
# JOEY
1075.491
What's up?
1076.866
# CHANDLER

It's about Kathy.
1079.744
1082.456
I like her.
1084.165
1084.583
I like her a lot, actually.
1086.793
# JOEY
1087.753
You do?
1088.753
# CHANDLER
1088.962
Yeah.
1089.962
# JOEY
1090.464
Your timing couldn't be better.
1092.757
1093.008
She's not my girlfriend anymore.
1094.801
# CHANDLER
1095.010
What?
1096.135
# JOEY
1096.678
Yeah, she broke up with me.
1098.763
# CHANDLER
1098.763
When?
1100.848
# JOEY
1101.141
Just now, after acting class.
1103.267
1103.519
I thought she was doing some scene,
so I let people watch.
1107.271
1108.300
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1109.691
Man, I am so sorry. Are you okay?
1112.735
# JOEY
1112.986
I've been better, but I'm all right.
So you like her?
1117.240
# CHANDLER
1117.491
Yes, but I don't have to.
1120.034
# JOEY
1120.285
No, it's okay.
1122.954
# CHANDLER
1123.831
Yeah?
1124.832
# JOEY
1124.832
Yeah.
1125.832
1126.291
You know why?
Because you came to me first.
1129.418
# CHANDLER
1131.880
I thought that would be
the best thing to do.
1135.049
1134.900
**LOL**
# JOEY
1136.051
You might have your work
cut out for you.
1138.845
1139.054
When I talked to her, I got the feeling
she's into some other guy.
1143.933
1145.200
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1145.144
See, that's actually what
I wanted to talk to you about.
1148.980
1150.149
I think I know who the other guy is.
1152.984
# JOEY
1153.193
Who?
1154.443
# CHANDLER
1156.196
It's me.
1157.613
1157.865
I'm the other guy.
1159.574
# JOEY
1160.075
What?
1161.534
# CHANDLER
1162.744
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...
1167.373
1167.583
...and one thing led to another, and....
1170.334
# JOEY
1170.544
And what? Did you sleep with her?
1172.962
# CHANDLER
1173.172
No, I just kissed her.
1174.797
# JOEY
1175.007
What? That's even worse.
1177.091
1177.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1178.051
How is that worse?
1179.406

1179.406
It's the same.
1180.761
1181.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1181.930
There's nothing I could do.
I'm in love with her.
1185.349
# JOEY
1185.559
Who cares?
1186.559
1186.810
You went behind my back?
I'd never do that to you.
1189.854
# CHANDLER
1190.105
I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.
1193.399
# JOEY
1193.609
You're so far past the line,
that you can't even see the line.
1198.446
1198.697
It's a dot to you.
1200.198
1200.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1200.782
Yes.
1201.908
1202.075
Yes, right. And I feel horrible.
You have to believe me.
1206.162
# JOEY
1206.496
Is that why you bought all this?
1208.831
1211.200
**LOL**
1210.626
You know what?
1211.834
1212.085
I will not watch your TV.
1214.503
1214.755
I won't listen to your stereo.
1216.589
1216.798
And there's a loaf in the new bread maker
I won't eat. Know why?
1221.093
# CHANDLER
1221.261
Because
1222.261
# JOEY
1222.471
It's all tainted with your betrayal.
1225.014
1226.600
This apartment is empty to me.
I'm not happy about you, either.
1231.479
1232.000
**LOL**
1237.861
And just so you know...
1239.820
