Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.
170.460

Especially the ones who may soon be
flying you to Europe for free...
173.422
173.590
...on their own plane.

In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks you can't go
the whole year without making fun of us.

187.728
# CHANDLER
187.896
I'll take that bet, my friend.
189.646
189.814
And you know what?
Paying me the 50 bucks can be...
192.065
192.233

No, I got really hot in my leather pants
so I took them off.
791.164

But they must have shrunk
from the sweat or something.
794.459
794.627
Or my legs expanded from the heat.
797.921

Well, if the paste matches the pants,
you can make yourself paste pants...
