Thank you.

Oh, Mike's picking me up for a date.

Oh, yeah? Now, how's that going?
Is it getting serious?

# PHOEBE
28.361
I don't know. I don't know.
I mean, you know, I like him.

But, you know, am I ready to take
my Grade A loins off the meat market?

39.164
You know, I really admire
your whole dating attitude.

It's so healthy. I'm always like,
"ls this moving too fast?

Is this moving too slow?
Where's this going?"
49.214

Yeah, I know.
You are a bit of a drama queen.
51.633
51.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
53.136
You're so much better off, you know?
You just go from guy to guy having fun...
57.598
57.766
...and not worrying that it
never turns into anything serious.
60.768
60.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
62.062
I wouldn't say "never."

I can't believe
I never realized this before.

I mean, you don't strike me as the type
of person that wants to get married anyway.

I can't tell whether she's hot or not.
What do you think?
201.408
202.800
**LOL**
202.577
Joey, I am not going
to objectify women with you.
206.622

One of these days,
I'm gonna have to start listening...
226.308
226.476
...when he talks about his job.
228.018

**LOL**
# JOEY
229.812
Hey, why don't you fly out there
and surprise him?
232.731
232.899
Maybe I will go.
235.275
235.693
Yeah. We'll have a little second
honeymoon at the Tulsa Ramada.

Oh, and you know what
you should bring?

Your black see-through teddy
with the attached garters.
245.953

# HAYLEY
307.557
Oh, um, that's just where you were going.
I figured I'd help you out.

see someone about that cold.

Every time I thought about
what you said, I started crying.
333.040
# ROSS
333.207
So he hasn't called?
334.604
# PHOEBE
334.604
Would you call this girl:
336.001
# ROSS
336.169
"Thanks for a lovely evening"?
339.421
339.100
**LOL**
340.340

342.799
# PHOEBE
342.967
You know what
you should feel terrible about?
345.552
345.720
This could have been my serious guy.
347.846
348.014
He was sweet and smart and funny.
350.515
350.683
Do you know how hard it is
to meet a guy like that?

You know what?
This whole place looks familiar.
404.861

I know I've seen
this weird plant before.

Oh, my God.
I've gone out with this girl before.

418.200
**LOL**
419.502
And then on that chair, and-- No.
422.212
422.380
No, we didn't do it here...

Oh, Phoebe is great. But, um....
476.725
476.893
I'm an idiot, okay?
478.894
479.061
Look, right before you guys went out,
I accidentally got her all upset.
483.607
# MIKE
483.774
Oh. That's why she was weird.
485.984
# ROSS
486.152
Yes, yeah. I said something stupid...
488.945
489.113
...about her never having
had a serious relationship.
491.573
491.741
But you should know, she is
so much fun. A wonderful person.
495.785
495.953
Please, don't blow her off.
498.038
# MIKE
498.038
I'm not gonna blow her off.
500.123

I actually just got off the phone with her.
We're going out tomorrow night.
503.251

stranger from the coffeehouse.
508.131

Well, then, I didn't need to bother you.

Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Is that true what you said?

Phoebe's never had
a serious relationship?

526.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
526.651
Of course she has.
528.443
528.653
If she's never had
a serious relationship...
531.154
531.322
...do you think I'd go
around broadcasting it...
533.615
533.783
...like some kind of unstoppable moron?

703.900
**LOL**
705.037
You promised to love him
no matter what.
706.830
706.997
"What" means, like, if he gets a disease
or kills someone.
711.167
711.100
**LOL**
711.669
Not if he gets his jollies to Jaws.

You know what, honey?
Guys are just different.
718.425
718.592
They like things
that we can't understand.
721.177
721.345
You know, I once dated this guy
who wanted to pretend...
723.680
723.848
...that he was an archeologist,
and that I was this...
727.016
727.184
...naughty cavewoman
who he unfroze from a block of ice.

# JOEY
742.324
Listen to this.
I went out with this girl last night.
744.534
744.702
Halfway through our date I realized...
746.661
746.829
...I already slept with her.
748.246
748.600
**LOL**
# RACHEL
750.207
You've slept with all the women
in New York...
752.167
752.334
...and now you're going around again?
754.669
754.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
754.879
That's not even the weird part.
756.337
756.505
I don't think she remembered
sleeping with me!
758.715
758.883
But you don't remember
sleeping with her.
760.675
# JOEY
760.843
Yeah, but she should remember sleeping
with me. I am very memorable!
764.012

766.681
# RACHEL
766.681
How do we know?
767.640
767.808
We've never slept with you.
768.996
# JOEY
768.996
And whose fault is that?
770.185
770.700
**LOL**
772.354
What's the big deal?
You forgot, she forgot.
774.689
774.857
Maybe you were having an off night.

# JOEY
776.316
Hey!
777.776
779.400
**LOL**
780.654
I never have an off night. Okay?
783.239
783.407
Although, sometimes if I'm a little bloated,
I don't feel that sexy.
786.785
786.952
But even then, I'm better than most.
789.037
788.300
**LOL**
#  MONICA:
790.539
Honey, why don't you just let it go
and ask her out again?
793.666

Yeah, you're both so slutty,
you don't remember who you slept with.

All right, well, I'll go out with her again
and I'll try to get past it.

No salt! Bloaty!

# ROSS
839.380
Oh, boy. You got mad at that part.
841.798
842.200
**LOL**
843.092
I went over there, you know,
to tell him how....
846.010
846.178
How great you are. Ahem, but....
849.806
849.974
Well, you know me. Blah, blah, blah.
852.642
852.700
**LOL**
854.979
And I ended up telling him, um, that....
856.855
# PHOEBE
856.855
What?
858.731
# ROSS
858.899
Um, you had a six-year-long
relationship...
863.194
863.362
...with a guy named Vikram.
865.280
865.900
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
866.907
What? Why?
868.950
# ROSS
869.118
Well, he seemed...
871.744
871.912
...to bum hard when I told him you'd
never been in a serious relationship.
876.791
878.600
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
881.171
If you hadn't just had a baby
with my best friend...
884.007
884.174
...I swear to Lucifer...
887.552
886.900
**LOL**
887.720
...a rabid dog would be feasting
on your danglers right now.
891.806
891.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
893.392
Phoebe, I think you'll feel differently
when you know...
896.311
896.478
...a little bit about Vikram.
898.855
899.800
**LOL**
899.398
Okay, he's, um....
901.399
901.567
He's a kite designer.
904.861
905.100

906.697
And he used to date Oprah.

# PHOEBE
911.660
I'm not going along
with some lie you made up, Ross.
915.496
915.664
I'm just gonna be honest with him.
916.873
# ROSS
916.873
Good.
918.082
918.250
Yeah, just be honest with him.

Yeah, I have nothing to be ashamed of.
921.003
921.003
No.
922.253
922.421
Okay, so, all right,
I haven't been in a relationship...
924.756
924.924
...that lasted longer than a month.
926.883
927.051
Okay? I haven't had a real boyfriend.
929.510
929.678
You know, if he can't handle it,
then he can leave. Which he will.
934.307
934.400
**LOL**
934.475
And, you know, that's okay.
So I'll just be alone forever.
938.102
938.270
You know, all right.
It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
941.022
941.190
I'll go on walking tours
with widows and lesbians.

# HAYLEY
976.892
So it was really a shock
after 25 years of marriage...
979.811
979.979
...my parents getting divorced.
I took it the hardest...
982.897
983.065
...because I was the youngest.
984.295
# JOEY
984.295
Mm-hm. Sure. Yeah.

...a certain amount of time ago.
Okay, I was here. You were here.
1006.587
1004.600

We had sex here, here, here....

might say "Geller"...

And on top of that, he's a glue sniffer?

1075.115
I know. But he calls,
and my heart goes to him.

smooth-talking freelance kite designer.

# MIKE
1084.792
I think there's somebody
better out there for you.

I'm not saying me, but....
1091.589
1092.800
Maybe me.

1095.400
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
1096.553

# PHOEBE
1117.533

Ross made him up.
1121.577
1121.745
Because I....
1123.204
1123.372
I really never have been
in a long-term relationship.
1126.290
1126.458
I've never lived with a guy.
I've never even celebrated an anniversary.
1131.003
1131.338
So....
1132.713
1134.258
You know, if that's too weird for you...
1137.176
1137.344
...and you want to leave,
I totally understand.
1139.512
1139.680
In fact, I'll close my eyes
to make it less awkward.
1143.099
1142.700

Can I think you're a little weird

and also want to kiss you?

Can I think it's cool
that you kissed me...
1173.671
1173.839
...and also want to kiss you again?

about the Magic Markers?
