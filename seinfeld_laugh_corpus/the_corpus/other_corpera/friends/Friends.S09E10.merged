He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle

And away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

Ere he drove out of sight

All right, well, maybe I should let you...
704.327
704.537
...and the second-prettiest girl
in Oklahoma get back to work.
707.497
# CHANDLER
707.707
Well, second prettiest that year.
709.040
709.208
Of all the girls in Oklahoma,

# WENDY
736.318
Ah. Fun conversation?
738.069
# CHANDLER
738.279
Ah, well, she's just got
this weird idea that, uh...
741.322
741.490
...just because you and I are alone
something's gonna happen.
743.867
# WENDY
744.243
Huh? Really?
746.745
746.912
Hmm. Would that be so terrible?
750.540
# CHANDLER
752.501
This is probably the wrong thing
to be worrying about...
755.587
755.755
...but you're getting ham
on my only tie.
759.591

# WENDY
768.037
Ha, ha. Missy?
769.809
# CHANDLER
770.019
I don't know. I'm not used to girls
making passes at me.
772.645
772.813
Wait a minute.
Am I sexy in Oklahoma?
776.858
776.700
**LOL**
# WENDY
777.818
You are to me.
780.111
# CHANDLER
780.111
No. No. No.
782.405
783.100
**LOL**

Look, I'm married.
785.200
# WENDY

Oh. What's that like?
791.873
792.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
793.000
Right. So I'm sorry, but--
795.106
# WENDY
795.106
Seriously? Happily married?
797.212
797.379
So that phone call before,
that was happy?
800.507
# CHANDLER
800.716
Well, look, it's not easy
to spend this much time apart.
803.927
804.136
She's entitled to be a little paranoid.
806.346
806.514
Or, in this case, right on the money.
809.182
809.800
**LOL**
810.309
You know, she's amazing
and beautiful and smart.
814.771
814.939
And if she were here right now,
she'd kick your ass.
818.566
819.300

821.153
Look, you're a really nice person,
ham stealing and adultery aside.
826.574
827.400
**LOL**
828.452
But what I have with my wife
is pretty great.
831.246
831.413
So nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.
834.457
# WENDY
835.000
Okay, let me ask you something.
837.252
837.419
If what you and your wife have
is so great...
841.005
841.173
...then why are you spending
Christmas with me?
844.425
845.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
845.845
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.
848.429

Really?
850.327
# CHANDLER
850.327
Are you kidding?

You're the most beautiful woman
in most rooms.
854.185
854.900
**LOL**
861.986
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
You and I just made out.
864.612
864.780
You and I are making out?
866.010
# MONICA
866.010
Well, not anymore.
867.240
867.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
867.992
But we don't do that.
869.910
# MONICA
869.910
I know. I just thought it would be fun.
871.828
# CHANDLER
872.955
How drunk are you?
874.477
# MONICA
874.477
Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this.
875.999
876.166
Not so drunk that you should feel guilty
about taking advantage.
879.419
# CHANDLER
881.171
That's a perfect amount.
883.214
883.300

# MONICA
# MONICA
889.555
You know what's weird?
890.451
# CHANDLER

What?
891.347
# MONICA
891.557
This doesn't feel weird.
892.745
# CHANDLER
892.745
I know.
893.933
# MONICA
894.101
You're a really good kisser.

# CHANDLER
896.707
Well, I have kissed over four women.

You wanna get under the covers?
901.566
# MONICA
901.566
Uh-huh.
902.400
# CHANDLER
902.568
Okay.
904.110

**LOL**
# MONICA
913.037
Wow, you are really fast.
914.662
# CHANDLER
914.872
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.
918.041
918.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
919.418
We're gonna see each other naked.
920.961
# CHANDLER
920.961
Yep.
922.503
# MONICA
922.671
You want to do it at the same time?
924.005
# CHANDLER
924.005
Count of three?
925.340
# MONICA
925.507
One.
926.257
# CHANDLER
# MONICA
926.257
Two.
927.008
# BOTH
927.176
Three.
929.260
931.300
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
933.140
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our friendship is effectively ruined.
937.185
# MONICA
937.394
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.
940.021
939.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
# CHANDLER
941.982
So are you really gonna go out
with that nurse-man?
944.400
945.600
**LOL**
# MONICA
945.778
Well, uh, you and I
are just goofing around.
947.820
947.988
I thought, why not
just goof around with him?
951.616
# CHANDLER
953.702
I don't know if you've ever looked up
the term "goofing around" in the dictionary.
957.956
958.123
Well, I have.
960.416
959.000
**LOL**
960.626
And the technical definition
is two friends...
965.588
965.756
...who care a lot about each other
and have amazing sex...
972.053
973.200
**LOL**
974.515
...and just want to spend
more time together.
978.810
978.978
But if you have this newfangled dictionary
that gets you mad at me...
982.146
982.314
...then we have to, you know,
get you my original dictionary.
986.025
987.000
**LOL**
988.821
I am so bad at this.
990.571

# MONICA
991.490
I think you're better
than you think you are.
993.783
# CHANDLER
993.993
Really? Okay. So if--?
995.890
# MONICA
995.890
Know when to stop.
997.787
# CHANDLER
997.997
You know, I sensed that I should stop.
1000.039
1000.000
**LOL**
1001.083
So we're okay?
1002.188
# MONICA
1002.188
Yeah.
1003.292
1006.755
Don't do the dance.
1008.110
# CHANDLER
1008.110
Right.
1009.465
1009.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
1011.093
I can't get married without
something old, something new...
1013.428
1013.595
...something borrowed, something blue.
1014.992
# CHANDLER
1014.992
Okay, okay.
1016.389
1016.700
**LOL**

Let's go.
1022.542
# MONICA
1022.542
No, no, wait.
1023.146
1023.313
We need something old.
1025.023
# CHANDLER
1025.232
Okay. I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.
1029.444
1028.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
1030.821
That'll work.
1032.488
# CHANDLER
1032.656
I don't think so.
1034.490
1034.600
**LOL**
# MONICA
1035.242
Okay. Now we just need
something borrowed.
1037.160
# CHANDLER
1038.829
Here, just take this.
1040.726
# MONICA
1040.726
That's stealing.
1042.623
1042.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1042.833
We'll bring it back.
Just put it under your dress.

1052.634
Aw.

Listen, um...
1063.144
1064.438
...I've been thinking.
1066.731
1067.357
It's not fair for me to ask you to spend
all of your money on our wedding.
1071.152
1071.320
I mean, you work--
You work really hard for that.
1074.405
# CHANDLER
1074.615
Well....
1075.720
# MONICA
1075.720
Well, you work for that.
1076.824
1077.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1078.744
Look, I've thought about it too.
And...
1081.454
1081.622
...I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.
1086.250
# MONICA
1087.169
You do?
1089.171
# CHANDLER
1089.171
Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.
1091.172
1091.500
**LOL**
1092.883
Yeah, look, when I proposed...
1095.009
1095.177
...I told you that I would do anything
to make you happy.
1099.305
1099.473
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy, then....
1103.142
1103.310
Then that's what we're gonna do.
1105.269
# MONICA
1105.854
You are so sweet.
1108.314
1110.734
But wait. What about our--?
What about the future and stuff?
1115.113
# CHANDLER
1115.322
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.
1119.075
1117.600
**LOL**
1119.243
You know, we'll pick our favorite,
and that one will get to go to college.
1123.412
1123.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
1124.623
You've thought about that?
1125.749
# CHANDLER
1125.749
Yeah.
1126.874
# MONICA
1127.042
How many kids were we gonna have?
1129.064
# CHANDLER
1129.064
Uh, four. A boy, twin girls...
1131.087
1131.255
...and another boy.
1132.713
1133.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
1134.466
What else did you think about?
1135.863
# CHANDLER
1135.863
Well, heh...
1137.260
1137.427
...stuff like where we'd live, you know.
1141.097
1141.306
Like a small place outside the city where
our kids could ride their bikes and stuff.
1145.768
1145.936
You know, we could have a cat
that had a bell on its collar...
1149.605
1149.773
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.
1153.651
1153.819
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.
1158.114
1158.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
1163.412
You know what?
1165.246

No.
