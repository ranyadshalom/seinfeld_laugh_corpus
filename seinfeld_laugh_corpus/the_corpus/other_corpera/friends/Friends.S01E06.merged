All right? He goes
into the shower, and then...
690.980
691.232

Oh, no, it's terrific.
701.491
701.701
After all your years of struggling...
703.910
704.120
...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.
707.330

**LOL**
# JOEY
710.501
Okay, fine.
Make jokes, I don't care.
712.877

This is a big break for me!

# ROSS
714.797
You're right. It is.

So are you gonna invite us all

What do you think?
Today's the big day!

# MONICA
737.820
Okay, go into the bathroom.
Use whatever you want.
740.655

Just don't ever tell me
what you did in there.

Come on, we're roommates.
753.793
755.800

My eyes! My eyes!

Can I borrow some things?
I wanna make Aurora breakfast.
769.642
# MONICA
769.894
You got the whole night, huh?
771.644
# CHANDLER
771.896
Well, I only have 20 minutes
until Ethan, so...
775.190
# RACHEL
775.441
Do I sense a bit of resentment?
777.358
# CHANDLER
777.610
No, no, no. No resentment.
Believe me...
780.695
780.946
...it's worth it, okay?
783.031
783.240
In a relationship,
you have these key moments...
785.450
785.659
...you'll remember
for the rest of your life.
788.119
788.370
Well, every single second
is like that with Aurora.
791.581
791.832
And I've just wasted
35 of them talking to you.
794.334
794.900
**LOL**
794.543
So, uh, Monica, can you
help me with the door?
797.796
# MONICA
798.047
Um, Chandler, you know, the old Monica
would remind you...
801.508
801.717
...to scrub that Teflon pan
with a plastic brush.
805.512
806.931
But I'm not gonna do that.
808.848

Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you
for this great opportunity.
823.738
# DIRECTOR
824.990
Lose the robe.
826.032
# JOEY
827.117
Me?
828.159
# DIRECTOR
828.410
That would work.
829.661
830.300
**LOL**
# JOEY
830.162
Right. Okay.
Losing the robe!
833.039
834.542
Okay, and the robe is lost.
836.501
# DIRECTOR
837.294
Everybody, I would like
to get this in one take.
840.088
840.297
Let's roll it.
841.631
841.841
Water's working.
843.258
844.051
And action!
845.844
# DIRECTOR
847.930
And cut!
849.347
850.182
Butt guy, what are you doing?
851.641
852.000
**LOL**
# JOEY
853.143
I'm showering.
854.352
# DIRECTOR
854.895
No, that was clenching.
856.354
856.600
**LOL**
# JOEY
857.189
Well, the way I see it,
the guy's upset here, you know?
860.984
861.235
His wife's dead,
his brother's missing.
863.486
863.696
I think his butt would be angry here.
866.406
865.700
**LOL**
# DIRECTOR
867.324
I think his butt would like
to get the shot before lunch.
870.076
870.200
**LOL**
871.036
Once again, rolling.
Water working.
873.913
874.915
And action!
876.833
878.168
And cut! What was that?
880.587
880.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
881.922
I was going for quiet desperation.
884.299
885.676
But if you have to ask...
888.511

**LOL**
# CHANDLER

# CHANDLER
898.689
No, actually, I meant my fingers.

Look at them.
Look at how happy they are.

Okay, okay.
912.994
# CHANDLER
# AURORA
913.954
I have to.

# AURORA
916.665
I'm sorry.
He'll be waiting for me.
919.208
# CHANDLER
919.418
I thought you talked to Rick.
921.044
# AURORA
921.295
It's not Rick.
923.171
# CHANDLER
923.380
Ethan? He gets
the whole day with you!
925.506
# AURORA
925.925
No, it's Andrew.
927.425
928.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
933.015
I know there'll be many moments...
935.016
935.225
...when I'll regret asking
the following question, but...
938.561
937.900
**LOL**
939.396
And Andrew is?
940.813
# AURORA
941.023
He's... new.
943.149
943.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
944.360
So you're not completely fulfilled
by Rick, Ethan and myself?
948.655
# AURORA
948.864
No, that's not exactly what I was...
951.324
# CHANDLER
951.533
Most women would kill...
953.368
953.619
...for three guys like us.
955.662
955.500
**LOL**
# AURORA
957.122
So, what do you want?
958.414
# CHANDLER
959.124
You.
960.166
# AURORA
960.459
You have me.
961.835
# CHANDLER
961.835
No, no. Just you.
963.211
# AURORA
963.587
What do you mean?
964.629
# CHANDLER
964.880
Lose the other guys.
966.714
966.300
**LOL**
# AURORA
968.759
Like, all of them?
970.468
970.300
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
971.178
Come on, we're great together.
Why not?
974.138
# AURORA
974.598
Why can't we just have
what we have now?
976.516
976.725
Why can't we just talk,
laugh and make love...
979.060
979.311
...without feeling obligated
to one another?
982.105
982.523
Up until tonight, I thought
that's what you wanted too.
986.109
# CHANDLER
987.319
Well, part of me wants that...
989.237
989.446
...but it's like I'm two guys.
991.656
991.907
I mean, one guy's saying,
"Shut up! This is great!"
994.867
995.000
**LOL**
995.995
But there's this other guy.
997.745
997.955
It's the guy who wells up
every time the Grinch's heart...
1000.957
1001.208
...grows three sizes
and breaks that measuring device.
1004.043
1003.200
**LOL**
1004.712
He's saying, you know,
"This is too hard. Get out, get out!"
1008.840
# AURORA
1009.758
So which one of the two guys
will you listen to?
1012.552
# CHANDLER
1013.721
I have to listen to both.
They don't let each other finish.
1017.348
1017.700
**LOL**
# AURORA
1019.018
Which one?
1020.059
# CHANDLER
1023.981
The second guy.
1025.023
# AURORA
1026.859
I see.
1027.900
1032.781
Call me if you change your mind.
1034.907
# CHANDLER

...unbelievably sexy...

1067.000

1068.233

I really believe big things are
gonna happen for you. I do.
