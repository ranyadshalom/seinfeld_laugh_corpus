255.629
# ROSS
255.838
What does he want with her?
257.589
# CHANDLER

I don't get it! Two months ago,
Rachel and I were this close.
280.237
280.446
Now I'm taking messages from guys
she meets at the movies?
283.865
284.075
I mean, this Casey should be
taking down my messages, you know?
288.036
288.830
Or Rachel and I should be together...
291.248
291.457
...and we should get
some kind of message service.

So do you have any other possibilities?
332.497

# ROSS
336.169
Monica, if you want,
I can lend you money.

# MONICA
338.713
No, no. If I couldn't pay you
back right away...
341.131
341.299
...then I'd feel guilty and tense
every time I saw you.
343.800
# ROSS
343.968
Oh. Then why don't you borrow it
from Mom and Dad?
347.012
347.221
You feel guilty and tense
around them already.
