You don't feel that now. lt was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.
16.473
16.725
You are, as your friend Tony
would say, "Great!"
21.937
21.400
**LOL**
23.690
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.
28.152

Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.

Are you--? Are you high?
88.754

**LOL**
# MONICA
89.881
I had the most amazing bath.
92.091
# CHANDLER
92.300
Really? I don't like baths.
93.989
# MONICA
93.989
You like them with me.
95.677
# CHANDLER
95.887
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.
99.973
99.500
**LOL**
# MONICA
100.683
Baths are so relaxing.
102.706
# CHANDLER
102.706
Really? What do you do?
104.728
104.938
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.
108.857
108.500
**LOL**
# MONICA
110.068
How dirty do you think I am?
112.528
112.600
**LOL**
112.779
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you'd love it.
117.407
117.575
It'd take all your stress away.
119.701
# CHANDLER
119.911
It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching
Road Rules. How stressed am I?
125.624

**LOL**
# JOEY
127.794
Hey, Chandler.
I really need to talk to you.
131.713
# CHANDLER
132.090
Oh, uh, yeah. ls this a cold pizza
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?
136.343
# JOEY
136.553
Well, neither.
139.013
# CHANDLER
139.013
Oh, my God, what's up?
141.473
140.800
**LOL**
# JOEY
142.517
I don't know. It's just....
Lately, I've been feeling....
148.772
149.440
Okay, here's what it is. Heh.
151.900
151.500
**LOL**
156.531
I feel a lot better. Thanks.

Wait a minute. Just come back.
161.702
# JOEY
163.163
Okay. You and Monica,
friends for a long time.
169.001
169.252
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.
173.755
174.007
But that's different. There are rules
there too, know what I mean?
178.719
# CHANDLER
178.887
Do you?
180.179
180.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
183.224
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place.
188.145
# CHANDLER
188.313
In London.
188.834
# JOEY
188.834
Yeah.
189.354
# CHANDLER
189.522
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.
193.108
193.000
**LOL**
# JOEY
193.818
This is a bad idea. Forget all about it.
196.945

This conversation, between you and me.

that doctor's appointment.
211.627

211.878
Right.
213.128
# PHOEBE
213.128
To find out the sex of the baby?
214.379
# ROSS
214.714
We don't wanna know
as long as it's happy and healthy.
218.717
216.500
**LOL**

Yep, healthy. And cute.
220.469

Are you two talking about the same baby?

226.600
**LOL**

Have you thought of names?
230.521
# RACHEL
230.521
Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.
232.564

Me too.

236.400
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
236.423
Uh-huh.
237.236

If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.
242.366
242.700
**LOL**

244.535
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

Rach, what were you thinking?
250.603
# RACHEL
250.603
Okay.

**LOL**
251.918
Um, I was thinking if it's a girl...
254.878
255.088
...how about Sandrene? It's French.
257.277
# ROSS
257.277
Huh.
259.466

That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

Hmm.
267.015
# RACHEL
267.225
Fine. What do you have?
268.893
# ROSS
268.893
It's for a boy.
270.560

I know it's a little out there, but...

274.482
...Darwin.

Yeah, by Sandrene.

You're saying that
because I said no to you.

That sounds fair.

If it's a girl, Rain.

# ROSS
300.967
Veto.
302.552

What?
369.285
# MONICA

I drew you a bath.

I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of sex on the balcony?
375.415
375.100
**LOL**
# MONICA
375.666
Try it for me. I used all my best stuff.
378.543
378.795
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.
384.091
384.342
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.
389.554
389.300

This does butch it up a bit.

I swear, you will love it.
395.936

If I do this, can we discuss balcony sex?

# MONICA
399.440
Absolutely.

402.485
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

All right, this isn't bad.
I like the flowery smell.

Which is okay, because I've got my boat.

You have it right there?

I didn't!

# RACHEL
531.239
I couldn't, because I don't know!
533.573
533.824
I swear I didn't see anything!
It was just a momentary lapse.
538.495
# ROSS
538.746
"Momentary lapse."
Don't you have any self-control?
541.957

Oh.
563.186
565.856
What's wrong?
567.483
# CHANDLER
567.483
I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.
569.109
569.318
The water's tepid, the salt didn't
dissolve and is now lodged places.
574.990
574.100
**LOL**
575.283
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile? Oh!
581.037
580.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
581.289
What?
582.623
# CHANDLER
582.623
Bath salts.
583.957
584.208
They're starting to effervesce.
586.960

It's different. It's interesting.
592.924

# MONICA
593.217
Let's talk about something else.
595.885
# CHANDLER
596.137
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?
600.432
600.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
601.267
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.
605.020
605.271
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.
608.773
# CHANDLER
608.983
I had the same conversation.
611.026
# MONICA
611.026
What was he talking about?
613.069
# CHANDLER
613.279
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since he was in Macbeth.
618.783
618.500

619.493
That was a long night.
622.600
621.600

# CHANDLER
622.600
What exactly did he say to you?
625.707
# MONICA
# CHANDLER
# MONICA
625.916
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.
631.004
# CHANDLER
631.255
Not to me.
632.401
# MONICA
632.401
What'd he tell you?
633.548
# CHANDLER
633.758
He asked about you, me and London.
636.843
637.094
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.
641.222
640.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
641.474
Okay. So you, me and London.
645.393
645.645
Looking at people differently.
648.313
648.564
Maybe he wants to do
what you and I did in London.
652.233
# CHANDLER
652.443
But what'd he mean by "rules"?
654.694
# MONICA
654.945
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.
658.782
# CHANDLER
659.116
He's looking at her differently.
661.076
# MONICA
661.076
Phoebe is his friend.
663.036
663.287
That'd be breaking the rules.
665.455
# CHANDLER
665.665
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

Um, just a minute!

That's Mrs. Tribbiani.

**LOL**
# CHANDLER
674.881
You don't say anything.
676.966
# MONICA
677.218
Why would I? That two of our friends
could start a great love affair?
682.806
683.057
They'd have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!
687.644
687.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER

I won't let you say anything.

Nothing.
713.211
# PHOEBE
713.671
Okay.
715.296
# MONICA
715.506
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

Really? Joey? You don't say.
745.702
# MONICA
745.911
Would you be interested?

You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

But, you know, on the other hand....
759.758
760.760
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

764.638
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.
767.307
# MONICA
767.516
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?
772.771
# PHOEBE
772.980
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.
777.484

You know what?
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.
799.881
798.400
**LOL**
800.132
I'd consider naming our child that.

how much that means to me. Oh....
809.307
810.976
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
814.270
814.480
You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.
823.446

# ROSS
830.246
I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...
833.122
833.374
...so you get to name him
when it's a boy.
836.584
836.836
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.
842.715
# RACHEL
842.925
I would-- Sequoia!

857.773
...and you know that it actually is a girl.
861.150
861.360
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.
864.863
863.300

Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

Joey, you're getting upset for nothing.
957.455

This is probably just a crush.
959.145
# JOEY
959.145
You think?
960.667
# PHOEBE
960.918
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but it goes away.

# JOEY
965.339
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!
