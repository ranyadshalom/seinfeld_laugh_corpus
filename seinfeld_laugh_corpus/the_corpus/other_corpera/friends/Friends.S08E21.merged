784.617
When you say "use," do you mean
"eat as a pre-cooking snack"?

# PHOEBE
835.626
Mm-hm. That's good to know. But let's
stop focusing on what you don't do...

839.713
...and focus on what you do do.
841.589

What I do do...

create an atmosphere of support...
853.434

# PHOEBE
855.396
I see. Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.

Heh. You called me that before...
875.790
875.958
...so I took the liberty of
fashioning a star out of foil.

# CHANDLER
1008.799

I was really nervous. I'm told I come on
too strongly, too many jokes.

And then it was really hard
to side step that "duty" thing.
