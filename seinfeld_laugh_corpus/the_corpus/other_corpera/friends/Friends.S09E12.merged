She's at home...

...putting up decorations
for Rachel's birthday party tonight.
10.843

**LOL**
# JOEY

And you're not helping?
12.136
# CHANDLER
12.136
I tried...
13.220
13.388
...but apparently singing "I Will Survive"
in a helium voice, not helping.

Uh, good news, everyone.
We finally found a nanny.

This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.

# MOLLY
34.617
Hi.
37.119
# ROSS
37.287
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.
39.747
# JOEY
39.956
You're damn right I am. I've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.
43.375
43.500
**LOL**
# RACHEL
44.586
Okay. You know what,
I'm just gonna take her outside.
46.920
# MOLLY
47.088
No, you stay. I'll do it.

Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

**LOL**
# RACHEL

What? You really think she's hot?
61.039
# CHANDLER
61.039
Are you kidding?
62.561
62.729
If I wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.
66.065
66.200
**LOL**

Joey?
69.443

How do you think she's doing?
71.487

Am I the only one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?
76.116

76.326
Ah, I mean, she's not unattractive, but...
78.619
77.600
**LOL**
78.619
Right.
80.913
81.081
...but hot? Ah....

83.500
**LOL**

So hot,
I cried myself to sleep last night.

Hey, Mike, what's the capital of Peru?
148.105
# MIKE
148.273
Lima.
149.586
# PHOEBE
149.586
No.
150.899
151.500
**LOL**
152.902
It starts with a V and ends with an X.
155.863
156.030
And hopefully with a T-O
in the middle.
159.908
159.600
**LOL**
# MIKE
160.451
You know, come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is "Vtox."
163.787
164.300
**LOL**
166.166
Oh, God!
166.832
# PHOEBE
166.832
What?
167.499
# MIKE
167.667
Okay. I don't want to freak you out
or anything...
169.960
170.128
...but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.
172.004
# PHOEBE
172.213
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.
174.673
174.700
**LOL**
# MIKE
176.509
Well, he's your pet rat?
178.343
# PHOEBE
178.553
Well, not so much a pet as,
you know, an occasional visitor...
181.180
181.347
...who I put food out for.
You know, kind of like Santa.
186.810
186.400
**LOL**
187.562
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the plate of cookies.
191.273
190.800
**LOL**
# MIKE
191.608
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're extremely unsanitary.
194.526
194.694
I mean, they transmit leptospirosis
and hantavirus.
197.696
# PHOEBE
197.906
What are those?
198.677
# MIKE
198.677
I don't know...
199.448
199.616
...but they don't sound
like spa treatments.
202.075
201.700
**LOL**
202.243
You have to get rid of it.
203.514
# PHOEBE
203.514
Okay, fine.
204.786
204.954
If it means that much to you,
I'll get rid of Bob.
207.247
# MIKE
207.457
Thank you.
209.124
# PHOEBE
209.292
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

# RACHEL
222.639
Gavin, I just want to say
thank you again...
225.349
225.558
...for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.
228.560
228.728
I really owe you an apology.
230.604
# GAVIN
230.897
For what?
232.273
# RACHEL
232.273
When we first met, you know...
233.649
233.816
...I thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.
237.319
# GAVIN
237.570
Is this your first apology?
240.197
239.800
**LOL**
# RACHEL
240.365
No, I just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.
243.617
243.785
And I think you're a really good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.
248.705

Morning.

But you know what?
Hey, new day, new leaf.
254.586
254.754
I am just really, really happy
258.423
258.900
**LOL**
259.676
I'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass
has something more important to say...
262.719
262.887
...so I'll just wait till it's finished.
265.681
265.700
**LOL**
# GAVIN
266.140
What?
267.120
# RACHEL
267.120
I was giving you an apology...
268.100
268.268
...and you were totally checking her out.
270.269
# GAVIN
270.478
I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion.
I was looking at her skirt.
274.439
274.000
**LOL**
274.607
Or was it pants? I didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.
279.236
279.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
280.154
Wow, you are really....
You're really a creep.
282.698
# GAVIN
282.865
What do you even care
if I was looking at her?
284.992
285.159
Are you jealous?
286.493
# RACHEL
286.703
Oh, yeah. I'm jealous.
288.370
288.538
"Oh, Gavin. Please,
please look at my ass."
291.873
293.167
Stop looking at my ass.
295.669
295.000
**LOL**
295.837
I mean, I just think
you are totally inappropriate. Okay?
298.588
298.756
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.
302.134
# GAVIN
302.343
But it was okay when you
slept with your old assistant, Tag?
305.846
# RACHEL
306.014
That is totally different for two reasons.
309.266
309.434
One, I didn't know that you knew that.
312.894
313.500
**LOL**
314.188
And two, I wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.
317.816
317.984
We had a-- We had a deep,
meaningful relationship.
322.446
# GAVIN
323.197
Huh. What was Tag's last name?
325.949
# RACHEL

It was....
327.868
329.300
**LOL**
329.662
Oh, my God.
331.538
331.706
He didn't have a last name.
335.250
334.800
**LOL**
335.418
It was just Tag, you know,
like Cher or...
341.089
341.466
...you know, Moses.
343.925
344.900
**LOL**
# GAVIN
345.386
But it was a deep,
meaningful relationship.
347.804
# RACHEL
348.014
You know what? My first impression
of you was absolutely right.
351.016
351.184
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!
353.977
354.145
Tag's last name was Morgan! Ha!
355.541
# GAVIN
355.541
It was Jones.

# CHANDLER
375.333
I wasn't staring.
377.125
377.293
I was leering.

378.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
380.254
What's the big deal with her?
382.130
382.298
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.
385.384
383.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
385.593
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

in your face.

to find someone attractive.
394.643

Makes me feel like I earned it.

with her.

to back off...

Okay, bye, Emma-wemma-demma.

They've elected me to talk to you

Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, I would
really prefer if you didn't go after her.
435.308
# JOEY
435.518
Why not?
436.560
437.100
**LOL**
# RACHEL
436.727
Because it took months
to find a good nanny.
438.562
438.729
And I wouldn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.
442.566
440.200
**LOL**
# JOEY
442.775
So you think I'm just
gonna sleep with her...
444.818
444.986
...and never call her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortable?
448.280
448.448
Yeah, that sounds about right.

**LOL**
# ROSS
451.451
Come on, there are plenty
of other women out there, okay?

Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-limits.
458.915
# JOEY
459.125
Oh, man. What'd you have to go
and say that for?
462.252

Now that you told me I can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

To kill Bob?

No. No, to test his neck strength.
503.460
503.300
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
503.669
But no, I don't want to kill him.
I thought we were gonna capture him...
506.922
507.089
...and, you know,
set him free in the countryside...
509.716
509.884
...where he could meet
a friendly possum...
511.801
511.969
...and a wisecracking owl.

Okay, okay. I'll throw away the traps.

523.397
Robert?

527.485
Wait, I think I hear him.

Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

542.415

Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

571.028
...make sure nothing happens
between him and Molly?

# CHANDLER

You don't trust him?
574.886
# ROSS
574.886
Well, no.
575.949
576.158
Some woman who sounded
a lot like Joey called earlier...
578.868
579.036
...and asked for her daughter,
uh, the "hot nanny."

# CHANDLER

Is this really your long-term plan,

You do appear right on the cusp

Look, come on, man. I'm sure
he'll lose interest in a week or two...

...but for now, could you please
just do this for me?
600.015
# CHANDLER
600.224
Fine, but don't blame me
if it doesn't work.
602.100
602.268
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something...
604.894
605.062
...more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.
608.523
608.900

we've gotta do something. Okay?

662.452
662.620
You guys are killing me.
She's forbidden fruit. It's like, like....
667.123
667.291
Like she's the princess
and I'm the stable boy.
671.086
670.700

I would like to introduce you...

Oh, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He already has plans...
777.984
778.152
...most likely with his mother.
780.612
780.700
**LOL**
# GAVIN

I don't mind. I'll cancel them. I would
never miss my secretary's birthday.

Why did you invite him?
I can't stand that guy.

God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course
he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.

Does he?
828.598
# RACHEL
828.598
What?
829.619
# MONICA
830.079
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he likes you.
833.122
831.200
**LOL**
833.290
It's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would push me...
836.000
836.168
...because he secretly
had a crush on me.
838.628
# RACHEL
838.796
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

to see if he could knock you over.

Well, I had to bring them.
We killed their mother.

953.744
So you see, Molly,
what people don't understand...
956.037
956.246
...is that acting is a discipline.
It takes a lot of hard work.
959.916
# MOLLY
960.125
So where'd you study?
961.563
# JOEY

This isn't fair. What makes you think
I'm gonna sleep with her...
995.535
995.703
...and then blow her off, huh?
997.286
997.454
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibility that I actually like her...
1001.708
1001.875
...and might want something real?
1003.876
1005.462
Look, the truth is I haven't felt
this way about anyone since Rachel.

And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.

What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

# PHOEBE
1087.544
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.
1090.505

**LOL**
# MIKE
1090.839
Yeah, uh, not such a problem with rats.
1093.299

No, they're more of a "love the one
you're with" kind of animal.

The-- We have seven rats.
1109.336
1109.336
Uh-huh.
1110.900
1111.068
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...
1113.694
1113.862
...and then each of those
have seven rats? That's like....
1117.824
1120.911
That's math I can't even do.
1124.038
1123.700
**LOL**
1125.040
What are we gonna do?
1126.999
# MIKE
1127.209
Well, I know this is gonna
sound crazy...
1129.627
1129.795
...but we could
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.
1136.384
1136.300
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
1138.428
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.
1142.014
1142.182
All right, so we should just
give them away.
1145.518
1146.145
But to nice families with children
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

Good.
1163.035

This is just so hard.
1164.787
1164.955
It's hard for me to let them go.
1168.374
1168.542
I guess it just brings back memories,
you know...
1171.711
1172.671
...from when I gave birth to my brother's
triplets and I had to give them up.
1177.550
