600.391
...all of a sudden you're jealous
that I've become the apartment stud.

604.770
Kind of sounds like your dream, dude.
606.479
606.900

609.191
Or it could mean you saw Chandler and me
together, being close and stuff...
613.612
613.779
...and you just wanna have that
with someone too.
616.156
# JOEY

643.893
Yeah, we could sit in the chair

But are we ever gonna have
the closeness like you guys have?
650.106

The reason I think Monica

Listen, I think it's a great idea to become
friends with someone before you date.

But I think the way you do it is you
meet someone, become their friend...
891.097

...build a foundation,
then ask them out on a date.
