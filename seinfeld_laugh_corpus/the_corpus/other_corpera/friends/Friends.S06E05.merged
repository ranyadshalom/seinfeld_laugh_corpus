When? After the birth
of our first secret child?
12.177

Ross didn't get the annulment.
We are still married.

21.938
Okay, maybe it wasn't
my best decision...
23.939
24.107
...but I couldn't face
another failed marriage.

# CHANDLER
26.651
Let me just jump in and ask.
27.860

At what point did you think
this was a successful marriage?

32.866
Rach, come on. If you think about it,
it's actually kind of funny.
37.369

Okay, maybe it's best
not to think about it.

There's a lost and found?

My shoe!

Well, I didn't realize till I got home.
135.425
135.593
I wasn't gonna walk all the way
back down here with one shoe.
138.595
138.500

I'm gonna go find that guy's car

164.204
164.372
Okay, and by the way,
they're not actually puppies.
167.708

They're Frank and Alice's triplets.
Okay, see you.

# PHOEBE
173.298
Please, please, please?
Frank and Alice...

...asked me to babysit the triplets.
I'm nervous. I've never done that by myself.

180.096
Don't worry about it, Phoebe. We'll do it.

363.363
See, that's where I think you're wrong.
We've been playing them man-to-man.

We should really be playing
a zone defense.

What do you mean?
371.161
# CHANDLER

I just think things will go smoother...
372.996
373.164
...if we each have our own zone, you know?
Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping.
377.042
377.600
**LOL**
377.752
And, Mon, you can be in charge
of diapering.
379.669
379.837
And I can be in charge of looking at how
cute they are when they put their hands....
384.049
384.900
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
385.843
That sounds really great,
but you should be in charge of wiping.
388.595

I should not be in the end zone.

Shocking, since you still have the keys.

You should see the treatment I get
when I'm with that car.
430.470
430.638
People are friendly. They wanna talk.
And not just about the car.
434.141
434.308
One guy advised me
on my equity investments.
436.351
# CHANDLER
436.561
What equity investments?
437.686
# JOEY
437.854
The ones that got me the Porsche.
Will you keep up?
440.897
443.200
**LOL**
444.902
I figured, if people keep seeing me
just standing there...
447.779
447.947
...they're gonna start to think
I don't own it.
449.781
449.949
So I figure I'll wash it, right?
Monica, you got a bucket and some soap?
453.201
# MONICA
453.369
Oh, yeah. I got soap
and sponges and rags...
456.121

...and carnauba wax
and polishing compound.
460.709
461.300
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
461.335
You don't even have a car.
462.794
# MONICA
463.212
I know. But one time there was this
dirty car parked in front of the building...
466.506
466.674
...so I washed it.
468.133
467.900
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
468.926
And?
470.240
# MONICA
470.240
And six others.

There you are.

**LOL**
# JOEY
480.646
And that's just in the city.
I get her up to 160 upstate.

Really? You got a place upstate?
486.026

# JOEY
504.337
Well, I found the keys,
and now I'm just polishing her up.
507.422
508.132
But it's my car.

# JOEY
509.633
Yeah, but it's my wax.

512.637
Listen, I don't come to the city much.
515.430
515.598
And I don't know if you're crazy
or if this is some kind of street theater...
519.226
519.685
...but could I have my keys?
521.853
520.500
**LOL**
# JOEY
522.021
Sure. Yeah. I'll save your parking spot.
525.190

I'm not coming back.
527.192
# JOEY
527.360
Why not?
528.277
528.277
I live upstate.

529.779
Yeah, so did I.
531.321

**LOL**
# PHOEBE
533.741
I don't know why I was so nervous
about this...
535.951
536.118
...and I don't know why Frank and Alice
are always complaining. This is easy.
539.287
# MONICA

Yeah, two hours, a lifetime,
that's the same.
542.082

# CHANDLER
544.001
Check it out. Check it out.
When the babies wake up...
546.836
547.004
...they can meet Krog.
548.838
549.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
551.259
What are you doing?
That thing could put someone's eye out.
553.635

He can do more than that.
He can destroy the universe.
557.347
557.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
557.765
No, Chandler, they could swallow
one of those little parts.
560.809
560.977
And also, look at his smooth area.
That's just gonna mess them up.
564.813
564.800
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
565.523
They're not gonna swallow anything.
You're too overprotective.
568.525
568.693
When I was a kid, my mom used to
just throw me into a pile of broken glass.
572.320
# PHOEBE
573.197
What?

**LOL**
# CHANDLER
593.217
All right, ahem. I thought about it,
and maybe you're right.
596.177

Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.
597.887
# MONICA
598.055
Good. What made you change your mind?
600.036
# CHANDLER
600.036
I swallowed his sonic blaster gun.

that I was right, you know?
607.731
607.898
And it turns out I was wrong...
609.941
610.109
...and now it's lodged in my throat.

Damn it, this whole time we were

Crack isn't even an intravenous drug.

# RACHEL
658.574
Well, you would know.
660.075
660.700
**LOL**
# JUDGE
662.078
Now, it also says here that
664.663
664.830
"Lied about your sexual preference
before marriage."
667.624
# ROSS
667.792
Oh, come on.
669.606
# RACHEL
669.606
Ross, please. I found the magazines.
671.419
672.800
**LOL**
# JUDGE
673.297
And, finally, that you were
"unable to consummate the marriage."
676.966
677.134
Well, that makes sense since
you're gay and addicted to heroin.
680.845
680.600
**LOL**
# ROSS
682.431
Okay, you know, I'm sorry,
this is insane.
684.933
685.101
I'm not addicted to heroin,
I'm not gay, and there is no problem...
689.396
689.563
...with my ability
to consummate anything.
691.314
691.482
Look, I'll consummate this marriage
right here, right now.
695.151
695.400
**LOL**
# JUDGE
696.487
That won't be necessary.
698.780
# ROSS
699.156
And when we were dating,
we consummated like bunnies.
702.826

# JUDGE
703.452
Now, if you two were involved in a serious

Your Honor, rest assured,
that relationship ended two years ago.
711.292

And can you please strike "consummated
like bunnies" from the record.
714.587
715.100
**LOL**
# JUDGE
715.506
Is there anything in this record
that is actually true?
718.800
# RACHEL

Uh, well, yes. We got married in Vegas.
722.262
722.430
And, uh, the names, I think.

725.100
**LOL**
# JUDGE
725.766
Well, based on what I've heard...
727.350
727.518
...you two certainly don't qualify
for an annulment.

730.688
If you don't wanna be together,
you'll have to file for divorce.

Of course.

with them. We're babysitting.

The babies are asleep.
I'm sure you'll be okay on your own.
855.562
# PHOEBE
855.729
But you can't leave me with them.
We're a team.

We're playing a zone.
They're gonna triple-team me.

He's got something plastic in his throat.
We gotta go to the hospital.

But, no, because a doctor won't be able to
help him. And it's just gonna, you know...

in, like, seven years.

But my apartment.

But the mess.

Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe

You're right. You're right,
I shouldn't freak out.

# RACHEL
1169.209
And yeah,
I didn't really wanna say anything...
1172.211
1172.379
...but it just kind of kept
coming back to me.
1175.131
1175.299
Um, remember, we were in the casino...
1177.133
1177.301
...and for some reason, you thought it'd
be funny to eat a lot of grapes.
1180.386
1181.700
**LOL**
1181.263
And I thought it would be funnier
if we got married.
1186.434
1187.100
**LOL**
1186.602
So, ahem, as a compromise, we decided
first to get married and then...
1191.564
1191.732
...to eat a lot of grapes.
1193.004
1193.004
To eat a lot of grapes.

I know.

1227.768
I always thought if you and I got married,
that would be the one that stuck.
1231.646
1232.314
And it wouldn't be a secret...
1234.982
1235.150
...and we wouldn't have our
wedding dinner at Pizza Hut.
1237.526
1238.400
