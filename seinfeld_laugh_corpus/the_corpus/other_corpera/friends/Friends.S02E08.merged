Okay.

**LOL**
# PHOE
29.571
Okay. All right.
Let's hear about the kiss.
32.239
32.407
Was it like a soft brush
against your lips...
34.867
35.035
...or was it like a, you know,
"I gotta have you now" kind of thing?
38.704
39.200
**LOL**
# RACH
38.913
Well, at first it was really intense,
you know? And then...
43.250
43.418
Oh, God. And then we just
sort of sunk into it.
46.295
# PHOE
46.463
Oh... So, okay, was he holding you?
Or were his hands on your back?
50.674
# RACH
50.842
No, actually, ahem, first
they started out on my waist...
54.386
51.900
**LOL**
54.554
...and then they slid up
and then they were in my hair.
57.181
57.390
Oh.
57.995
57.995
Oh.
58.599

Would you be willing to cook naked?

**LOL**
# MNCA
139.847
There's an ad for a naked chef?
141.974
# JOEY
142.142
No, but if you're willing to cook naked,
then you might be willing to dance naked.
147.104
147.272
And then...

148.418

168.333
# ROSS
168.543
Yeah, it was.
But I get home, okay...
170.502
170.670
...and I see Julie's saline solution
on my night table...
173.755
173.965
...and I think, "Oh, my God.
What the hell am I doing?"
176.466
176.634
I mean, here I am with Julie,
this incredible, great woman...
179.553
179.721
...who I care about
and who cares about me...
182.514
182.682
...and am I just gonna
throw all that away?
184.850

You got all that
from saline solution?

But now I'm with Julie.
197.362
197.530
You know? So it's like, me and Julie,
me and Rachel.
200.407
200.575
Me and Julie, me and Rach...

There was a girl
We'll call her Betty

And a guy
Let's call him Neil
269.726
270.700
**LOL**
270.478
Now I can't stress
This point too strongly
274.273
274.524
This story isn't real
277.442
276.700
**LOL**
279.904
Now our Neil must decide
Who will be the girl that he casts aside?
284.658
284.867
Will Betty be the one
Who he loves truly?
287.077
286.200

287.328
Or will it be the one
Who we'll call Loolie?

He's gonna stay with her
and she'll be:
434.850
435.101
"Hi, I'm Julie. Ross picked me.

We'll get married and have lots

486.151
486.151
Oh.
487.068
487.100

488.738
We'll put their names
in bold with different fonts...
491.573

...and I can use different
colors for each column.

I don't know.
507.297

508.799
All right, I guess you can say
she's a little spoiled sometimes.
513.386
# JOEY
513.596
You could say that.
514.679
# ROSS
514.847
Yeah.
516.431
516.500
**LOL**
517.183
I guess, you know, sometimes
she's a little ditzy, you know?
520.310
521.812
And I've seen her be a little
too into her looks.
524.606
525.233
Uh. Oh, and Julie and I have
a lot in common...
527.442
527.610
...because we're both
paleontologists, right?
530.612
530.780
But Rachel's just a waitress.
532.614
# CHAN
532.782
