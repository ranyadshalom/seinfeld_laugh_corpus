I think it upsets Sheldon
when you play with the food.
15.975

**LOL**
# SHELDON
16.142
No, it upsets Sheldon when she
willy-nilly takes it from the containers...
20.146
20.313
...without regard
for its equitable distribution.
23.107
23.274
This is essentially
why you have famine in India.
26.319
# PENNY
28.487
You want me to put it back?

It upsets Sheldon...

What's up, my nerdizzles?

Raj, Sheldon, I want you
to meet my girlfriend, Bernadette.

Leonard, Penny.
45.921

You know my girlfriend, Bernadette.
47.297
# LEONARD
47.297
Yeah. Hey.
48.507
# HOWARD

Bernadette,
say "fo'shizzle" to my nerdizzles.

# BERNADETTE
51.886
I don't think I can.

# HOWARD
58.309
I hope it's all right, I told Bernadette
she could join us for dinner.
61.937
# LEONARD
62.104
Sure. The more, the merrier.
63.605
# SHELDON
63.605
No, that's a false equivalency.
65.107
65.300
**LOL**
65.274
More does not equal merry.
66.651
66.817
If there were 2000 people in this
apartment, would we be celebrating?
69.945
70.112
No, we'd be suffocating.

Sheldon.
72.781

We ordered for five people, not six.
74.867
# PENNY
74.867
It's fine.
76.118
76.285
We'll put it on the table, family-style.

# SHELDON
78.537
Oh, sure. Why don't we put our hands
behind our backs...

Why not?

That's where Sheldon sits.

He can't sit somewhere else?

# PENNY

In the winter, that seat's close enough
to the radiator...
102.937
103.104
...so he's warm
yet not so close that he sweats.
105.398
105.564
In the summer,
it's in the path of a breeze...
107.858
106.700
**LOL**
108.025
...created by opening windows there.
109.902
110.069
It faces the television at an angle
that isn't direct so he can talk...
113.489
110.700

...yet not so wide
that the picture looks distorted.

Perhaps there's hope for you after all.

# BERNADETTE

Just eat your dinner.
179.242
# BERNADETTE
179.242
Don't take him too seriously.
180.806
180.973
A lot of what he says
is intended as humor.
184.435
184.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
184.977
Yeah, well,
I don't think it's very funny.
187.062

Me neither,
but he just lights up when I laugh.

Leonard, Howard says you're working on
fundamental tests...
200.326
200.493
...of quantum mechanics.
202.161
# LEONARD
202.161
I am. Are you interested in physics?
203.829
# BERNADETTE
203.996
I find it fascinating.
205.164
205.498
If I hadn't gone into microbiology...
207.333
207.500
...l probably would have gone
into physics or ice dancing.
211.670

# LEONARD
212.463
My tests of the Aharonov-Bohm
quantum interference effect...
215.341
215.508
...have reached an interesting point.

217.468
We're testing phase shift
due to electric potential.

That's amazing.

as amazing as third graders...

...growing lima beans
in wet paper towels.

It's not about shoes, is it?

It's not about shoes.
312.292

313.772
Um, actually, can we do it in private?

318.110
Go away.

# PENNY

Thanks, Raj.
Okay, so here's the thing.
329.121
329.288
I was wondering if you could
maybe teach me a little physics.
332.708
# SHELDON

A little physics?

Yeah.

There's no such thing.
Physics encompasses the entire universe.

to spinning galaxies.

# SHELDON
353.103
Why can't Leonard teach you?
354.563
# PENNY

Because I wanna surprise him.
356.023
# SHELDON
356.190
Can't you surprise him
in some other way?
358.150
358.317
For example, I'm sure he'd be delightfully
taken aback if you clean your apartment.

# PENNY
363.364
Come on, Sheldon,
this is important to me.
365.491
# SHELDON

a massive undertaking...

...and my time
is both limited and valuable.

What is physics?
620.913

Physics comes
from the ancient Greek word "physika."

that our story begins.

that Aristotle was wrong...
881.673
881.840
...and force was not necessary
to maintain motion.
884.426
884.593
So let's plug in our 9.8 meters
per second squared...
887.888
888.054
...as A and we get force--
Earth gravity.

Equals mass times
9.8 meters per second per second.

1217.091
1217.258
...the transport of electrons
through the nano-fabricated rings...

already conducted in the Netherlands.
