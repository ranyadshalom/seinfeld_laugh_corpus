It's very simple.

201.332
For breakfast, she has
an egg white frittata.
203.543
204.200
**LOL**
203.751
Give her a choice of home fries
or an English muffin.

# ARTHUR
795.634
I don't know. I think I'm just
798.220
798.470
I just don't want to be
Professor Proton anymore.
803.475
# SHELDON
804.184
Well, how can you say that?
Professor Proton's the best.

# ARTHUR
809.064
What has it ever gotten me'?
811.233

I mean, I'm an 83-year-old man

817.740
817.400
**LOL**
818.574
Other scientists think I'm a joke.
821.160

Uh, thanks.
848.395

848.604
But if you don't mind me asking, uh,
the potato clock, how does it work?
853.317
854.100

Is it a trick clock or a trick potato?

# SHELDON
872.378
I wrote a fan letter to you
when I was a child in Texas...
875.881

back to me.
881.178

# ARTHUR
883.889
I'll give you a hint. I have a bracelet

**LOL**
# SHELDON
891.688
Well, anyway, um,
you may find this hard to believe...
894.900
895.150

friends growing up.
898.070
# ARTHUR
899.571
No, I get that.
901.365

# SHELDON
904.076
But, urn, I did have you.
907.371
907.579
And every day at 4:00,
you'd come to my house on Channel 68...
912.000
912.209
...and we'd do science together.
914.294
914.670
If it hadn't been for you, well, who knows
what would have become of me, you know?
918.632
918.841
Instead of a world-class physicist,
I could've wound up as a hobo...
924.179
924.805
...or a surgeon.

# LEONARD

935.190
935.399
In a way, their discoveries
are your discoveries.
