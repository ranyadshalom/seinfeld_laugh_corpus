I've invented a science joke...
5.798
5.965
...would you like to hear it?
6.946
# AMY
6.946
Sure.
7.926
# SHELDON
8.343
How many Edisons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?
11.471
# AMY
12.388
How many?
13.160
# SHELDON
13.160
Who cares?
13.932
14.098
He stole the idea
and doesn't deserve his own joke.
17.519
17.300
**LOL**
# AMY
17.685
Is that really true?
19.062
# SHELDON
19.229
Of course.
That's how you know it's a good joke.
21.606
21.773
It not only entertains, it informs.
24.400
24.900
**LOL**
# BARRY
26.444
Hey, sorry to interrupt.
27.862
# SHELDON
28.029
Barry, uh, how many Edisons does it take
to screw in a lightbulb?
31.991
# BARRY
32.158
Did you know Edison
didn't actually invent the lightbulb?
35.328
35.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
37.872
What do you want, Barry?
39.958
39.400
**LOL**
# BARRY
40.416
Just wanted to drop this off
as a little thank-you for Amy.
43.127
# AMY
43.294
What's this for?
44.691
# BARRY
44.691
Your idea really helped me out.
46.089
46.256
My light-cone quantization paper's
online already.
48.800
48.967
The response has been amazing.
51.219
# AMY
51.386
That's fascinating, I
can't wait to read it.
53.596
# SHELDON
53.763
Oh, no. Me, as well.
55.306
59.500

Why "dot biz"?
Because I just gave you the business.
62.438

# BARRY
67.443
Anyway, thanks again.

71.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
73.616
Since when do you help out Barry Kripke?
75.702
# AMY
75.868
I'd been thinking about a cellular approach
to neuronal connectivity...
79.330
79.497
...and thought it might have applications
to string theory.
82.250
82.417
It's not a big deal.
83.710
# SHELDON
83.710
Oh, really?
85.003
85.169
When I was doing string theory
and hit a dead end...
87.589
87.755
...why didn't you try to help me?
89.465
# AMY
89.632
I did. You said the only math
biologists know...
92.302
92.468
...is if you have three frogs and one
hops away, that leaves two frogs.
96.848
96.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
97.807
That's pretty funny,
that does sound like me.
100.143
99.600
**LOL**
100.310
But it doesn't mean you should be
standing on street corners...
103.271
103.438
...handing out your math
to whatever guy comes along.
106.524
106.500
**LOL**
# AMY
107.900
Sheldon, we're all scientists.
I helped out a fellow colleague.
110.987
111.154
You're being petty.
112.655
# SHELDON
112.655
I'm being petty?
114.157
114.657
You know Barry and I have
a professional rivalry.
117.160
117.327
You heard him, he told me to suck eggs.
119.704
119.871
If we were friends, he would've suggested
I suck something pleasant.
123.041
124.100
**LOL**
126.336
Why are you laughing?
128.129
128.296
Did you learn something?
130.340
156.300
**LOL**
156.616
Okay, Ma, say hi to Aunt Gladys.

162.914
Oh, she loves it.
164.165
164.374
She finally found a place where
everyone talks about how sweaty they are.
168.127
168.700
**LOL**
169.295
She wants us to go to the house
and check in on Stuart.
171.964

"Because he might be lonely."

# BERNADETTE
174.467
She's just being nice.
175.968

I'm her son, how come she doesn't
send someone to check on me if I'm lonely?
179.806
# BERNADETTE
179.972
Because you have a wife?
182.809
182.300

184.811
Yeah, well, sometimes you work late.
187.939

# BERNADETTE
188.648
I know you don't like
Stuart in the house...
190.733
190.900
...but the store's about to reopen,
he'll get back on his feet.
193.820
# HOWARD
193.986
That'd be great. I'd love for things
between me and Morn to get back to normal.

You okay?
209.669
# SHELDON
209.669
If I was okay...
210.628
210.795
...I would've said "Hello"
and not the more ominous "Hello."

**LOL**
# PENNY

What's going on?
216.447
# SHELDON
216.447
I'm mad at Amy.
217.719
# PENNY
218.219
Did she leave pit stains
in your favorite crop top too?
221.681
# SHELDON
222.348
No.
223.850
224.000
**LOL**
224.434
She helped Barry Kripke make
an advancement in string theory.
227.854
# PENNY
228.020
Oh. That sounds like a good thing.
230.022
# SHELDON
230.189
Well, it would be, except
I left string theory...
232.692
232.859
...because I decided it was a dead end...
234.861
235.361
...and then she went behind my back
to help someone else prove me wrong.
238.865
239.031
My rival, no less.
240.450
248.800

I'm sorry I didn't have a camera.

# SHELDON
257.884
Why would she do this to me?
259.427
# PENNY
259.594
Well, I'm sure she didn't
upset you on purpose.
262.388
262.555
Don't you say there's nothing more
important than the advancement of science?
266.517
# SHELDON
267.018
No. I said there's nothing more important
than me advancing science.
271.230
271.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
272.023
If I'm understanding this and all she
did was help another scientist...
275.359
275.526
...I'm thinking you might have to
let this one go.
278.196
# SHELDON
278.446
Ugh. "Let it go."
I have heard that my whole life.
281.824
281.991
Every time something upsets me,
somebody says, "Let it go."
284.702
283.300
**LOL**
284.869
Like it's my fault
and it's not okay to feel the way I feel.
287.205
# PENNY
288.498
I don't know what to tell you.
Why don't you talk to her?
291.125
290.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
291.876
Is that all you have? Shopworn tidbits
like, "Talk to her" and "Let it go"?

296.255
Gee, Penny, life's given me lemons,
what should I do?

I made her in third grade...

...and the ribbon I got in swim class
for putting my face in the water.

What is your problem? She said it was okay.

Some son. Looks like you spent
10 minutes on that clown art.

# HOWARD
372.331
I should've gone to an art school...
374.000

...then I could run a failed comic shop
and mooch off some guy's mother.
377.503

# BERNADETTE
379.088
Why don't we leave so you can cool off?

**LOL**
418.294
Just out of curiosity...
420.212
420.379
...if I were to let something go,
how would I do that?
424.467
# PENNY
425.009
I don't know,
just think about something else.
427.470
# SHELDON
428.846
Can I think about the spiny anteater?
430.472
# PENNY
430.472
Sure.
432.099
# SHELDON
432.266
The spiny anteater...

...never went behind my back
and worked with Barry Kripke.
438.689

That didn't help at all.

448.449
Okay.

Now, imagine you're holding that pen.

But I just got this pen.

What if I told you
that over the past few months...

490.950
...Amy has secretly been
giving you little puzzles...
493.744

...to test your intelligence
against chimpanzees in her lab?

# PENNY

Why would she even do this?

# SHELDON
562.146
She's been conducting
an experiment on apes...
564.273
564.440
...where they're given puzzles to solve.
566.484
566.650
I was surprised
at the complexity of the puzzles...
569.070
569.236
...and thought some humans
wouldn't solve them.
571.405
571.572
And that's when Amy said,
"Wanna make this interesting?"
574.825
574.800

# PENNY
576.077
Make this interesting?
You bet money on me?

No, no, we designed an experiment

582.833
See, now, isn't that interesting?
585.336
585.700
**LOL**

It's not interesting, it's
incredibly insulting.
589.632

Before you go too far, not a special pen...
598.474
598.641
...with your initials engraved on it.

636.053
636.220
...and in plain view of what,
for a 10-year-old...
639.306
639.473
...was a quality piece of string art!

645.729

...Stuart has a source of income

That is a good point.

671.922
# WAITRESS
672.089
Sure. Let me go check on that.
674.216
# RAJ
675.134
Dude, I think that's Nathan Fillion.
678.345
# LEONARD
679.680
Oh, yeah, look at that.
681.599
# RAJ
681.765
And he's picking the tomatoes
out of his salad just like I do.
685.936
686.103
I always did feel a connection with him.
687.938
688.400
**LOL**
689.523
Oh, I have got an idea.
691.734
# LEONARD
691.901
We're not selling his tomatoes on eBay.
694.612
695.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
695.362
No, if we got Captain Reynolds
from Firefly...
698.782
698.949
...to do a signing at Stuart's store,
that would be amazing.
702.453
# LEONARD
702.620
That would be great.
704.038
# RAJ
704.038
Should we go talk to him?
705.456
# LEONARD
706.081
I don't know. If he's not nice...
708.083
708.250
...it's gonna make it hard for me
to watch him in anything again.
711.795
# RAJ
712.004
The guy who plays Jon Snow was a jerk.
We still watch Game of Thrones.
716.300
# LEONARD
716.467
He was a jerk because you rear-ended him.
718.844
719.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
719.720
I was distracted.
721.263
721.430
It's weird seeing a member of the Night's
Watch with a kayak strapped to his car.
725.184
725.300
**LOL**
727.353
Come on.
728.938
733.108
Hi, excuse me. Don't mean to bother you,
but we're just really
736.654
736.820
We're big fans of Firefly.
And Dr. Horrible.
739.990
# NATHANFILLION
740.157
Oh, I think you made a mistake.
I'm not an actor.
743.202
# RAJ
743.869
Don't say that.
745.371
745.537
I mean, you're not Dame Judi Dench,
but you're pretty great.
749.208
749.800
**LOL**
# NATHANFILLION
752.253
I get it. You think I'm Nathan Fillion...
754.296
754.463
...but I'm not, so if you don't mind,
I would just love to eat my lunch.
758.050
# LEONARD
759.385
Come on. Sorry to bother you.
762.054
# RAJ
762.471
Don't know why he's so grumpy.
764.390
764.556
I got mistaken for that guy
in Life of Pi once, I'm still floating.
768.686
768.600
**LOL**
# AMY
772.273
Sheldon, it's me.
774.483
# PENNY
774.650
Uh, hey, did you see that?
777.027
777.236
I figured out how to open
the door all by myself.
780.864
780.800
**LOL**
782.700
Maybe I'll fling some feces around my cage
to celebrate.
787.496
786.900
**LOL**
# AMY
788.205
What are you talking about?
789.873
# PENNY
790.040
I know you've been giving me
secret puzzle tests.
793.043
793.300
**LOL**
# AMY
795.045
Sheldon, open the door.
796.692
# SHELDON
796.692
I can't.
798.340
798.507
I'm naked.
800.551
800.500
**LOL**
# AMY
801.385
I just saw you.
803.387
# SHELDON
803.554
Hang on.
805.306
805.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
806.181
Open the door now.
808.350
# AMY
808.517
Oh, hey.
809.789
# PENNY
809.789
Pull up your pants!
811.061
810.700
**LOL**
# AMY
813.188
It's not a big deal.
814.523
814.690
I run tests like this
on undergrads all the time.
817.401
817.568
If you fill out some paperwork at
the university, I can get you $5.
821.697
821.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
821.864
I don't want $5. I want my dignity.
824.908
# AMY
826.201
What are we talking, like 10 bucks?
827.911
828.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
830.873
Thank you.
831.812
# RAJ
831.812
Thanks.
832.750
# LEONARD
834.418
Sorry again.
835.231
# NATHANFILLION
835.231
No problem.
836.045
# RAJ
836.670
Uh, are you sure you're not him?
839.256
839.423
You can tell us.
We're scientists, not crazy fanboys.
843.010
843.000
**LOL**
# NATHANFILLION
844.845
All right, fine. I'm him.
848.015
# RAJ
848.182
And you're eating alone at a deli?
851.352
851.518
I don't buy it. You're not him.
853.520
853.600
**LOL**
# NATHANFILLION
854.855
I wanted to eat my lunch in peace...
856.607
856.774
...but I really am him,
and thank you very much for being a fan.
859.985
860.152
If you want, uh, let's take a picture.
862.112
# LEONARD
862.279
That would be great. Thank you.
863.947
# RAJ
# LEONARD
# NATHANFILLION
863.947
You bet.
865.616
# RAJ
869.286
Wait, hang on.
870.996
870.900
**LOL**
871.914
If you're really Nathan Fillion...
873.791
874.500
...what's the line from Firefly
about your bonnet?
876.835
877.900
**LOL**
# NATHANFILLION
878.420
I swear by my pretty floral bonnet,
I will end you.
881.507
882.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
882.925
That's it. That's the line.
884.343
# RAJ
884.968
Although, I knew the line.
Doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.
889.098
888.900
**LOL**
# NATHANFILLION
891.183
Do you want the picture or not?
893.144
# RAJ
893.144
I want a picture with Nathan Fillion.
895.104
894.700
**LOL**
# NATHAN
896.230
How about a picture with a guy
who looks like Nathan Fillion...
899.149
899.316
...but a little more annoyed
than Nathan Fillion usually is?
901.944
901.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
904.446
What do you think?
905.531
# RAJ
906.865
Eh, it's good enough for Facebook.
908.242
909.200
**LOL**
914.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
916.417
I can't believe they did that.
917.835
# PENNY
918.001
I know, it's so insulting.
920.003
920.170
At one point, they had me figure out
how to get a banana out of a puzzle box.
924.466
924.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
924.633
Wait. Sheldon gave me a banana in a box.
He was testing me too.
929.638
929.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
930.305
Unbelievable.
931.682
# LEONARD
931.849
And how could a chimp even solve that?
That was impossible.
935.018
# PENNY
935.185
Really? You couldn't get it out?
937.354
937.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
941.442
Thank you.
942.880
# AMY
942.880
Wow, the store looks great.
944.319
# LEONARD
944.486
So you guys were testing us both?
What is the matter with you?
947.364
# PENNY
947.531
What's the matter is they think they're so smart
they don't care if they hurt others' feelings.
952.244
# AMY
952.411
That's not true.
953.578
# SHELDON
953.578
Sounds like us.
954.746
954.200
**LOL**
956.874
I still don't understand why you're upset.
958.876
959.042
You solved every puzzle
faster than all of the chimps.
962.087
# AMY
962.254
Well, except Barnabas,
but he was on Adderall.
964.840
965.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
966.717
I'm sorry, but it's making me crazy.
968.594
# BERNADETTE
968.760
Can you please just let it go?
970.888
# SHELDON
971.054
Oh, I can help you with that.
973.098
974.349
Imagine you're holding an ordinary pen.
977.936
977.600
**LOL**
979.188
While your favorite pen
is safe and secure in your pocket.
983.275
982.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
984.985
Hold that thought. Hello?
987.404
# AMY
988.113
How can I make this up to you?
989.615
# PENNY
990.240
The answer's in this puzzle box.
Let's see if you can open it.
994.536
993.900
**LOL**
# STUART
997.956
You could have warned him
about the furniture.
1000.334
# RAJ
1000.501
That's what I said when we moved it.
1002.419
# BERNADETTE
1002.586
You helped him?
1003.921
# RAJ
1004.087
No, Stuart picked out those
throw pillows all on his own.
1008.091
1007.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1011.261
Hey, you okay?
1013.096
# HOWARD
1013.764
No.
1014.723
# LEONARD
1014.723
What's wrong?
1015.682
# HOWARD
1017.768
My mom died.
1020.229
# BERNADETTE
1020.395
What?
1021.939
# HOWARD
1024.441
That was my aunt.
1027.277
1027.486
Ma took a nap.
1029.863
1030.531
She never woke up.
1031.990
# BERNADETTE
1033.408
Oh, my God, Howie.
1035.577
# LEONARD
1037.704
I'm so sorry.
1039.414
# RAJ
1040.791
What can we do?
1042.000
# HOWARD
1044.628
I don't know.
1047.047
# SHELDON
1051.760
May I say something?
1053.012
# LEONARD
1053.012
Not right now, Sheldon.
1054.263
# SHELDON
1054.429
But I think it would be comforting.
1055.952
# LEONARD
# HOWARD
1055.952
No, it's okay.
1057.474
1058.100
What?
1059.434
# SHELDON
1060.269
When I lost my own father...
1062.771
1062.938
...l didn't have any friends
to help me through it.
1065.315
1067.234
You do.
1068.277
# PENNY
1074.449
I really thought he was gonna say,
"Let it go."
1077.828
1078.100
**LOL**
1084.900
**LOL**
1084.835
Okay. Thanks, Bernadette. Travel safe.
1087.879
1088.714
Okay, bye.
1090.507
1091.008
Uh, they booked a flight,
they're heading to the airport now.
1094.344
# PENNY
1094.511
How's Howard holding up?
1096.179
# RAJ
1096.346
He's hanging in there.
1097.722
# LEONARD
1097.722
How are you doing, Stuart?
1099.099
# STUART
1101.184
I still can't believe she's gone.
I mean, that woman took me in.
1104.187
1105.606
If it wasn't for her,
I would have been homeless.
1108.191
# AMY
1108.358
One of us would have taken you in.
1110.193
# STUART
1110.360
Yeah, I don't recall any offers.
1112.529
1112.500
**LOL**
1113.905
But you know what?
I'm glad it worked out the way it did...
1116.867
1117.034
...because I got to know
this wonderful person.
1121.038
# RAJ
1121.204
Yeah. Mrs. Wolowitz was pretty special.
1124.583
1124.750
When I first moved to America...
1126.793
1127.002
...Howard was my only friend...
1129.463
1129.630
...and she made me feel
so welcome in her home.
1132.799
1133.008
Which says a lot,
because those first few years...
1135.552
1135.719
...she thought I was the gardener.
1137.804
1137.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
1140.140
Whenever I saw her she'd say
I was too skinny and try and feed me.
1145.312
# AMY
1145.896
She did that to me too.
1147.648
# PENNY
1147.814
Don't take this away from me.
1150.067
1150.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1151.318
I didn't care for her yelling.
1153.612
1154.404
But now that I'm not going
to hear it again, I'm sad.
1158.241
# LEONARD
1158.408
If you want, I can yell at you later.
1161.411
1161.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1163.038
It won't be as good.
1164.414

# LEONARD
1167.542
Let's have a toast.
1168.794
1171.088
To Mrs. Wolowitz. A loving mother...

1177.761
...to all of us.
