He can look out the window...

unfolding before his eyes.

# AMY

Yes. According to the relationship agreement,
on the anniversary of our first date...
193.032
193.199
...he must take me to a nice dinner,
ask about my day...
196.035
196.202
...and engage in casual physical contact...
198.204
198.371
...that a disinterested onlooker
might mistake for intimacy.

Just a couple minutes.
210.758
210.967
You've really never done this before?
212.802
# AMY
212.802
Once in high school. But I dozed off...

...and woke up with second degree
chemical burns on my face.

Oh, my gosh, that's awful.
Did the other kids make fun of you?

No, I had a cover story.
I told everyone it was herpes.

228.317
# PENNY
228.317
I don't know. It's still kind of weird.
230.403
230.570
We haven't really recovered since he
proposed to me in the middle of sex.
234.031
# AMY
234.198
Oh. Boo-hoo.
236.451
236.300
**LOL**
237.034
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex...
238.870
239.036
...my ovaries would grab onto him
and never let go.
241.748
244.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
247.920
Leonard, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?
251.299
# LEONARD
251.758
Interesting question. On the one hand--
253.760
# SHELDON
253.760
You don't even know what it is, do you?
255.762
255.800
**LOL**
256.763
The anthropic principle states...
258.890
259.056
...that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does...
262.977
263.144
...the answer is that
it must have qualities...
265.897
266.063
...that allow intelligent creatures
to arise...
268.399
268.566
...who are capable of asking the question.
270.568
270.735
As I am doing so eloquently right now.
274.071
274.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
275.031
I know what the anthropic principle is.
277.033
# SHELDON

Of course.
I just explained it to you.
279.410
279.600

Now, where do you stand on it?
282.955
# LEONARD

Where do you stand on it?
284.123
# SHELDON
284.123
Strongly pro.
285.124
# LEONARD
285.291
Then I believe that God
created the world in six days...
287.960
288.127
...and on the seventh
he made you to annoy me.

# RAJ
310.817
Hey, if you guys are free tonight
I heard about a spa...
313.694
313.861
...where you soak your feet
in a pool of fish...
316.322
316.489
...that eat the dead skin off them.
318.199
319.200

**LOL**
336.634
...the only sea creature
I would consider being eaten by...
339.387
339.595
...is the Kraken. Because the last words
I would hear are "release the Kraken."
343.641
344.892
That never gets old.
346.686
346.500
**LOL**
346.853

348.437
348.604

350.314
Besides, I'm having dinner with Amy.
352.984
# RAJ
353.359
Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone.
355.903
356.112
Which is cool. I eat alone, I
sleep alone, I cry alone, so...
360.491
361.325
...cool.

375.506
# SHELDON

Oh, absolutely.
377.383
377.550
I have a contractual obligation...
380.011
380.177
...to provide Amy with conversation
and casual physical contact.
383.764

You realize how small
your problems are...

Hey, Ma.

Okay, here it is:
738.577
739.036
Bernadette and I
are starting a life together.
743.082
743.249
And--
743.812
743.812
Oh, God.
744.375
744.541
You are gonna leave me!

I guess I'm just the kind of person
people like to leave.

It's not definite. I'll talk to Bernadette.
761.141
761.308
Don't bother.
762.393
762.559
I'll just go sit in a hole in the ground
so I'm no trouble when I die.

I knew it! I knew she was behind this.
777.283

I mean, Penny, you've always known
how this man has felt about you.

**LOL**
860.407
But the point is,
the two of you got past it.
864.161
864.370
And you go and propose to this poor girl
in the middle of sex?
868.207
