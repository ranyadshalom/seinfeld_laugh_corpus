93.073

The procedure for diagnosing pinworms...
94.387

# RAJ
728.187
Wondering if you're free Friday.
They're having '80s night at the Greek.
731.649
731.815
Hall & Oates, Katrina and the Waves,
and three-fifths of Kajagoogoo.

Oh, heh.
737.738

That's really sweet, but the thing is--
739.740
# RAJ
739.740
Oh, there's a thing.
741.575
# PENNY
741.742
Look, honey, I was really drunk
and made a huge mistake last night.
745.537
745.704
We should have never slept together.
It's what ruins friendships.
748.999
# RAJ
749.166
You can't ruin a friendship with sex.
751.293
751.502
That's like trying to ruin ice cream
with chocolate sprinkles.

Come here. Just
758.342

Listen to me. I
760.261
760.427
I wanna go back
to the way we were before.
762.680
763.180
You know, friends.
764.348
764.515
No sprinkles.

Thank you.
774.566
# RAJ
776.735
Well, uh...
777.778
779.154
...as your friend,
you might like to know that, um...
783.909
787.121
...we didn't have sex
in the conventional sense.
792.042
794.500

Oh, God, did you pull
some weird Indian crap on me?

# RAJ
802.094
No, no.
804.555
805.264
After we got undressed
and jumped in bed...
807.891
808.058
...you asked if I had protection.
810.394
# PENNY
810.561
Oh, you did, didn't you?
812.146
# RAJ
812.146
Well, of course. I'm always packing.
813.731
813.800
**LOL**
815.274
Anyway, urn, I had trouble putting it on...
818.736
818.902
...and you tried to help, and...
822.740
825.576
That was all she wrote.
827.661
829.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
832.833
So we didn't actually--
835.106
# RAJ
835.106
I did. It was beautiful.

you won't tell anybody about this.
845.679
# PENNY
845.846
Of course, I won't.
846.930
# RAJ
846.930
Oh, good.
848.015
849.391
And, uh, can I tell people that our love
burned too bright and too quickly?
852.351
852.478
Kind of a Candle in the Wind deal?
855.022
854.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
855.189
Sure.
855.960
# RAJ
855.960
Oh, good.
856.732
856.899
It fell apart because you're all,
"I wanna have your babies"...
859.902
860.110
...and I was
861.507
861.507
"I'm too rock 'n' roll to be tied down"?

To the south is Professor Loomis
and the Geology Department.
921.338
921.505
According to their Twitter feed,
they're out of sunblock...
924.383
924.550
...which means they'll have
to hug the tree line or risk melanoma.

That's our edge. All we have to do
is move quickly over this ridge.
