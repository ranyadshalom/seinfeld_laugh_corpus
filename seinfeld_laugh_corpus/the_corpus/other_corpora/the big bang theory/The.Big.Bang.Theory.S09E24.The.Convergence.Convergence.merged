Hey.

# PENNY
5.574
Hi, how was the screening?
6.554
# LEONARD
6.763
Oh, Sheldon invoked Rosa Parks
8.806
8.973
to make somebody, who out the line,
feel bad,
11.267
12.477
but only the white people felt bad.
14.103
14.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
16.564
I should have never
bought him that coloring book
17.941
18.024
that explains Black History Month.
19.651
20.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
21.194
How'd it go with my mother?
22.274
# PENNY
22.445
You know, it started a little rocky,
but I think we got to a good place.
25.865
# LEONARD
26.324
Wow. Well done.
27.951
# PENNY
28.117
Yeah, and when I dropped her off
at the hotel,
29.369
29.452
she even gave me a hug.
30.620
# LEONARD
30.995
Did she think you were choking?
32.247
33.400
**LOL**
34.415
I'm sorry, that's great.
Thank you for spending time with her.
36.710
# PENNY
36.793
No problem.
37.919
38.586
So, listen, I don't know
if you have any plans next weekend,
42.757
42.924
but I kind of promised your mom
we'd have another wedding ceremony
45.843
46.010
so she could attend this time.
47.554
48.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
50.098
Wait, we're gonna get married again?
51.433
# PENNY
51.516
Yeah, kind of, but now
we can invite our friends and family.
54.143
# LEONARD
54.644
Seems like a lot of trouble for a hug.
56.164
57.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
57.564
Come on, it'll be fun. And you know,
your mom was genuinely hurt
60.025
60.108
we didn't invite her to the first one.
61.568
# LEONARD
61.651
Well, in our defense,
it was kind of a spur-of-the-moment thing.
64.904
65.071
And also, we don't like her.
66.447
67.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
68.658
Leonard, come on, she's your mom.
69.784
69.867
If we can do something to make her happy,
why wouldn't we?
71.786
# LEONARD
71.869
I just said why. We don't like her.
73.830
74.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
74.622
Okay, look, forget about her,
let's do it for us.
76.583
76.749
We can keep it small and informal,
and this time we can invite our families.
79.836
# LEONARD
80.295
Is your brother out of prison?
81.421
# PENNY
81.504
Thanks to overcrowding, yeah.
82.839
83.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
85.341
I'd love it if my dad could come.
86.593
# PENNY
86.676
Oh! You have to invite him.
I haven't seen him since the divorce.
89.262
# LEONARD
89.429
Oh, he is like a different man.
91.514
91.681
He stopped twitching,
and I think he grew an inch and a half.
94.475
95.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
96.019
Well, then it's settled.
97.270
97.645
Yay!
98.646
99.063
God, it's so funny, I never thought
my second marriage would be to you.
103.026
131.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
131.512
Okay, so, it's not a legal ceremony,
133.181
133.348
it's just a chance for us
to redo our vows
134.766
134.849
so everyone can be part of it.
136.392
# AMY
137.393
So, there's no maid of honor?
138.811
140.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
140.229
No.
141.043
# AMY
141.043
Hmm.
141.856
144.192
But if I were to, say,
wear a purple satin dress
147.320
147.487
with a sweetheart neckline
and stand near you,
149.405
149.572
you wouldn't be able to stop me, right?
151.741
152.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
153.326
I don't see how I could.
155.078
# AMY
155.953
Then I graciously accept.
157.393
157.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
159.290
Who's going to officiate?
160.458
# PENNY
160.625
I was kind of hoping you would.
162.126
# AMY
162.418
Wait, now I'm just
some lousy maid of honor? What?
164.837
164.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
166.589
Hey, good news. I just got off the phone
with my mother.
168.675
168.758
She is coming to the wedding.
169.918
# PENNY
170.343
Okay, you're inviting people
to our wedding?
173.304
# SHELDON
173.471
Yes, I'm inviting people to our wedding.
176.140
177.100
**LOL**
177.767
Yeah, I've already asked Stephen Hawking
and Robert Downey, Jr.,
180.603
180.770
and now, don't get your hopes up,
'cause he's pretty busy, but Erno Rubik.
183.856
184.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
185.775
Who's Erno Rubik?
186.776
# SHELDON
187.735
Seriously?
189.112
189.278
He invented the Rubik's Cube.
190.738
191.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
192.281
Okay, fine, but why would you invite him
to our wedding?
194.481
# SHELDON
194.992
Because despite his fame and fortune,
he strikes me as a lonely man.
198.579
199.500
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
200.832
Well, it's very sweet of you
to go to all this trouble
202.876
202.959
for Leonard's mother.
204.001
# PENNY
204.168
You know, I'm also doing it for Leonard.
205.378
205.461
I think
this could really help their relationship.
207.421
# BEVERLY
207.505
How dare you invite your father
without consulting me?
210.717
211.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
213.136
I'm sorry,
but I don't think I need your permission
215.304
215.471
to have my father at my wedding.
217.140
# BEVERLY
217.306
You do understand our marriage ended
because he had an affair.
220.643
# LEONARD
220.893
I know, and there's no excuse for that.
223.479
# BEVERLY
223.646
He claimed I was cold, emasculating,
226.649
226.816
and hadn't shown him
any physical affection for years.
229.652
# LEONARD
230.737
I was wrong,
there's three excuses for that.

I'm not sorry, that's true.

# HOWARD
632.221
I don't know what to do.
It's the Air Force.
634.390
634.807
I mean, should I respond to their email?
Ignore it?
637.518
# RAJ
637.977
You can't ignore it.
638.978
639.145
It's not that postcard that says
it's time to go back to the dentist.
641.865
642.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
644.024
Guys, come on,
we're meeting everyone for dinner.
645.485
# HOWARD
645.568
One sec. I'm just afraid if I respond,
then they'll know I got it.
649.488
# RAJ
649.655
Dude, the minute you opened that email,
they knew you got it.
652.408
652.575
I mean, they're probably looking at you
through the camera right now.
654.952
655.000
**LOL**
655.035
Damn.
656.328
658.122
I love America.
659.248
659.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
662.209
Are you done with this nonsense?
663.336
# HOWARD
663.419
It's not nonsense.
This is how the US military works.
666.672
# RAJ
666.839
If it's even the US military.
668.090
668.257
It could be foreign military
pretending to be American.
671.218
# HOWARD
671.594
You're right. We turn our guidance system
over to them,
673.679
673.762
next thing we know,
they're using it against us.
675.642
# RAJ
678.225
I also love the enemies of America.

689.528
Penny, I hope the example
of my failed marriage to Leonard's father
693.866
694.033
doesn't discourage you from the commitment
you've made to one another.
697.119
# PENNY
697.536
No, of course not.
699.038
# BEVERLY
700.873
Although, Alfred and I had a lot more
going for us than you two.
704.043

Mom, please save something for the toast.
708.964

714.386
So, Alfred,
what is it that you do for a living?
716.472
# ALFRED
716.639
Oh, I'm an anthropologist.
I study ancient peoples and cultures.
719.975
# MARY
720.142
My goodness!
So, all the way back to the Flood.
722.811

Don't laugh, she wasn't joking.

Play with your phone.
729.652
732.600

# ALFRED
734.615
Well, on that note,
there are many cultures
736.825
736.992
that have an apocalyptic flood
as part of their mythology.
739.870
# MARY
740.329
I don't have a mythology,
I have the unerring word of God.
743.249
743.415
But that's very interesting.
744.458
# ALFRED
744.458
Oh!
745.501
745.300
**LOL**
746.168
I didn't mean to disparage your faith.
Actually, I admire it.
749.672
# MARY
749.838
Really?
750.422
# ALFRED
750.422
Yes.
751.006
751.173
I'm an agnostic, myself,
752.675
752.841
but I have prayed many times to God
to turn my wife into a pillar of salt.
758.180
758.400
**LOL**
# MARY
759.515
Well, he came close. He turned her
into a giant block of ice.
762.601

**LOL**
# RAJ
768.148
Howard, there must be someone
at the university you can go to for help.
770.948
# HOWARD
771.485
Are you kidding?
772.486
772.653
They're probably the ones who leaked it
to the military in the first place.
775.613
# RAJ
776.991
What about the guy on the Channel 4 news?
779.868
780.077
You know? "Four on your side."
Maybe he can be on your side.
783.539
784.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
785.916
I'm being harassed by the government.
787.710

I'm not trying to get to

# BERNADETTE
792.506
Ugh. Stop.
794.174
794.341
You know what's really happening?
795.718
795.884
All the movies you've watched,
the TV shows, the comic books,
798.345
798.512
they've completely twisted your thinking.
800.347
800.514
No one's after you,
no one's listening to you,
801.933
802.016
no one cares about you.
803.392
# RAJ
806.186
I'd like to think
807.187
807.354
the "Four on your side" guy
cares about me.

# PENNY
812.651
You know, Beverly, I know you and Alfred
have your differences.
815.487
815.654
But if you think about it,
if you hadn't married him,
818.574
818.741
there'd be no Leonard.
820.242
820.659
So, that's good, right?
821.994

822.661
Yeah.

God, I think someone's following us.

# BERNADETTE
841.930
You're being ridiculous.

I'm not being ridiculous. He's right
on my tail.
845.860
846.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
846.769
Turn left here
and see if he turns with us.
849.313
# PENNY
850.939
Oh! Why is he turning here?
The restaurant's the other way.
853.442
# LEONARD
853.609
I don't know. He uses that traffic app,
maybe there's an accident.
856.737

Oh! So follow him.

866.246
# BERNADETTE

It's probably just a coincidence.

Speed up a little,
see if he stays with you.
870.751
871.200

# PENNY

Well, go faster, you're losing him.
873.629
# LEONARD

What is his hurry?

# PENNY
875.005
You know what? Flash your lights,
let him know it's you.
877.205

**LOL**
# HOWARD
878.342
He's flashing his lights.
What's that mean?
880.552
# RAJ
880.719
I think he wants us to pull over.
882.471

Do not pull over!

So, after your husband passed,
you never remarried?
895.901
# MARY
896.068
No. Just focused on work and the church.
898.946
# ALFRED
899.154
Ah! And what do you do?

900.781

We were following Howard,
but for some reason

924.555
he turned off his headlights
and went up a one-way street.

about the bread.

Oh, that was you?
965.304

Long story.
Why don't you go ahead and eat?

# ALFRED
983.489
Now, one of the more exciting things
we found recently
985.908
986.074
is that Neanderthals and Homo Sapiens
frequently mated with each other.
990.621
# MARY

Well, that certainly explains
my marriage to Sheldon's father.
994.082

was not a very clever man.
