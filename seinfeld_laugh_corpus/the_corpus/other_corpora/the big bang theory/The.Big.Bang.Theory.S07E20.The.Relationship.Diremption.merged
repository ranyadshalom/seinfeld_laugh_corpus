I got to tell you, the more
I read about the primordial
5.595
5.762
gravity wave discovery,
the more excited I get.
8.515
# RAJ
8.681
I know. Being an
astrophysicist right now
10.475
10.642
is like being a rock star.
11.768
# HOWARD
11.935
Only without the sex.
13.561
# RAJ
15.104
Yeah, literally, none of it.

# LEONARD

What do you think about it, Sheldon?
20.048
# SHELDON
20.151
Meh.
21.653
22.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
21.819
Are you kidding me?
23.655
23.821
This may be the biggest
scientific breakthrough
25.865
26.032
of our lifetime.
27.116
27.283
How can you, as a theoretical
physicist, not care about this?
30.620
# SHELDON
30.787
Maybe it's because
I'm not an elitist.
32.747
32.914
What I'd like to know is:
34.123
34.290
How does this gravity wave
breakthrough
36.167
36.334
help the man on the street?
You know?
37.961
38.127
Who's looking out
for Joe Six-Pack
39.879
40.046
and all his quantum physics concerns?
42.423

**LOL**
# LEONARD

Oh, my God, you're jealous.
45.218
# SHELDON
45.385
Why would I be jealous?
47.303
# LEONARD
47.470
I don't know. Maybe because
the origin of the universe
49.764
49.931
just got proven,
the Higgs field just got proven
52.600
52.767
and you've been working on
string theory for the last 20 years
55.395
55.562
and you're no closer to proving
it than when you started.
58.022
# SHELDON

Yeah, well, I've had a lot
on my plate.

Sorry for eavesdropping,
but there actually was
70.410
70.493
some big string theory news today
out of the Hadron Collider.
73.538
# SHELDON
73.705
Really?
Did they find evidence to support
75.999
76.165
extra dimensions
or supersymmetry?
77.917
# BARRY
78.084
No, but they did find evidence
that you'll believe anything.
81.921
82.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
83.840
Why would you do that?
85.174
85.341
You're a string theorist as well.
87.302
# BARRY
87.468
Incorrect.
I am a string pragmatist.
90.221
90.388
I say I'm gonna prove something
that cannot be proved,
92.724
92.890
I apply for grant money,
94.183
94.350
and then I spend it
on liquor and broads.
96.561
97.000
**LOL**
97.687
Later.
99.564
# SHELDON
101.524
Do you think he's right?
103.735

Am I wasting my life on a theory
that can never be proven?

Is something bothering you?

Yes, but you wouldn't understand.

# PENNY

Come on, try me.
158.164
# SHELDON
159.207
All right.
161.125
163.127
I've devoted the prime
of my life to string theory
165.755
165.922
and its quest for the
compactification of extra dimensions.
169.759
169.926
I've got nothing to show for it,
and I feel like a fool.
173.096
# PENNY
174.138
OK. I get it.
176.015
176.182
I mean, not all the jibber-jabber
in the middle, but...
178.351
179.200
**LOL**
180.228
...l know what it's like to put your
heart and soul into something
182.355
182.438
and get nothing out of it.
183.940

**LOL**
# PENNY

195.243
No!
196.703
196.000
**LOL**
197.453
I'm saying you and string theory
sound like a relationship,
200.039
200.206
and I know what it's like
to be in one
201.416
201.499
and realize it's never gonna
turn out the way you want.
203.793
# SHELDON

I said Leonard, you said no.
206.963

# PENNY

I'm talking about other guys.
210.049
# SHELDON
210.216
OK. Well, what do you do?
214.095
# PENNY
214.262
You have to have the courage
to end the relationship.
216.723
216.889
You know? Break it off,
shake hands, walk away.
219.726
# SHELDON
221.477
I don't know if I can do that.

Um, kind of hit a bump.
248.671
248.838
When I was honest and told Emily
250.631
250.798
she wasn't the only person
I was seeing, it went great.
253.050
253.217
So I tried the same thing with Lucy.
254.844
# HOWARD
255.011
And?
257.117
# RAJ
257.117
She had mixed feelings.
259.223
259.600
**LOL**
259.348
But when I said,
"Emily was cool with it.
261.684
261.851
Emily's the best. Why can't you
be more like Emily?"...
264.011
264.400
**LOL**
266.063
...those feelings
became less mixed.
269.108

Women. Who knows what'll set 'em off?
274.197

At least now I can focus all
my energies on just one girl.
278.117
# HOWARD
278.284
I hope I get to meet her
as soon as possible.
280.119
# RAJ
280.286
Why the rush?
She isn't going anywhere.
281.913
# HOWARD
282.079
She is. But I like that attitude.
284.373
284.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
286.375
Gentlemen, is anybody interested
in my old string theory books?
290.087
# RAJ
290.254
You're really going to do this?
291.881
# SHELDON
292.048
I am. Yeah, Penny pointed out
294.091
294.258
that what I'm going through
is essentially a breakup.
296.969
297.136
And according
to Cosmopolitan magazine,
299.889
300.400
**LOL**
300.056
one of the most effective
techniques for moving on
302.225
302.391
is to get rid of all reminders
of the relationship.
304.977
# HOWARD
305.144
You're reading Cosmo?
306.291
# SHELDON
306.291
Yes.
307.438
307.605
As it turns out, there's an article
309.482
309.649
on how to get over a breakup
in literally every issue.
312.527
313.500
**LOL**
314.403
Anyway, it suggests
that I set these on fire,
316.906
317.073
but the smell of burning books
319.116
319.283
reminds me of church picnics
in East Texas.
322.119
322.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
324.080
What's this?
325.665
# SHELDON
325.832
That's just a doodle of
a hyperelliptic Riemann surface.
329.502
# LEONARD
329.669
Oh, yeah. Wasn't that the basis
of your postdoc fellowship?
332.588
# SHELDON
332.755
It was.
334.090
334.257
This seemed so elegant
at the time,
336.717
336.884
but now I realize I was just
a simple country boy,
340.054
340.221
seduced by a big city theory
342.723
342.890
with variables
in all the right places.
345.226
345.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
347.103
It's going to be OK.
348.125
# SHELDON
348.125
I know.
349.146
349.313
As hard as this is,
I have to move on.
351.357
351.524
I can't keep postulating
multidimensional entities
354.235
354.402
and get nothing in return.
356.070
356.237
I have needs, too.
359.031

# HOWARD
364.036
So, you and Emily
still together?
367.164

# HOWARD
373.004
I spoke to Bernadette.
She's free tomorrow night.
375.214
# RAJ
375.381
OK, great.
376.465
376.632
But if we're really gonna do
a double date,
378.968
379.135
then we have to go over
some ground rules about Emily.
381.304
# HOWARD
381.470
Like when it turns out
she's made of rubber,
383.556
383.723
I don't say anything?
385.057
384.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
387.059
She's very real.

That's what it says on the box.

See? This is exactly
the kind of thing
398.362

I'm worried about you
saying in front of her.
400.323
# HOWARD
400.489
I promise I'll be
on my best behavior.
402.450
# RAJ
402.617
You better be. No jokes about
how close I am with my dog.

Or the truth about how close

to get over a breakup
is a new look.

What about your old look,

# PENNY
439.654
So, how do you want me
to cut it?
441.656

How about Bill Gates
meets Nikola Tesla?
445.952
445.900

So, business in the front,
science in the back.
450.039

Or I don't cut it and
maybe just style it a little.

# LEONARD
464.720
That doesn't work anymore.

He just thinks I'm taking him
to the doctor.
468.349
469.000
**LOL**
470.059
So, now that you're
no longer invested in string theory,
472.728
472.895
what are you gonna pursue?
474.313
# SHELDON
474.480
There are so

# AMY
519.463
Yeah, it's cute. That's the problem.
521.277

I don't need other girls
