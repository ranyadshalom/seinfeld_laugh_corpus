Why don't you wanna
get your mother from the airport?

I can do without the 40-minute car ride
78.543

where she criticizes
every aspect of my life.

She can cover it in a car ride?

You really want me

# LEONARD

I just feel like it would be
a good chance for you to bond.
93.766

Did you guys see
there's an Avengers screening?

Joss Whedon's gonna show
some deleted scenes
155.578
155.745
and do a question and answer session.
157.225
# SHELDON
157.372
Well, I have a few questions for him
about the last Avengers movie,

# LEONARD
164.337
When's the screening?
165.546
# RAJ
165.713
It's tonight,
but it's first come, first served,
167.549
167.632
so we should probably
get there early and wait in line.
169.551
# HOWARD
169.634
Let's do it.

# LEONARD
171.094
Penny's busy with my mother, so I'm in.

# SHELDON
173.221
Bad news, Amy's making me
go shopping with her later,
176.432
176.599
so it looks like none of us can go.
178.601
179.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
181.604
You do realize we're allowed
to have fun without you?
184.315
# HOWARD
184.482
In fact, that's usually the trick to it.
186.651
187.100
**LOL**
189.112
What time do we need to get there?
190.280
# RAJ
190.363
Uh, I'd say by 3:00.
191.781
# SHELDON
191.948
You're really going without me?
193.616
# LEONARD
193.783
It's not a big deal. Go shopping with Amy,
and we'll save a spot in line for you.
197.412
# SHELDON
197.578
You don't have the authority
to save places in the line.
200.373
200.540
If I do that, I'll be cutting.

You don't have to avoid having
intimate conversations with me.
254.427
# PENNY
255.428
Well, I'd actually like
for us to be close,
257.722
257.889
but maybe we start with our favorite books
259.640
259.807
and work our way up
to my husband's sex organs.
262.310
263.000
**LOL**
# BEVERLY
264.687
Very well. What's the last book you read?

# BEVERLY

Penny, it's only natural to want
your mother-in-law to like you,
275.615
275.782
and I acknowledge
I can be an intimidating person.
278.701
280.000
**LOL**
279.452
So, what can I do
to make this process easier for you?
282.330
# PENNY
282.497
For starters, maybe you can
not psychoanalyze everything I say?
285.833
285.600
**LOL**
# BEVERLY

And how does it make you feel when
I psychoanalyze everything you say?
290.505

Uncomfortable.
293.508

301.349
301.516
a little mother-in-law,
daughter-in-law dinner tonight?
304.060
# BEVERLY
305.311
So, just the two of us?
306.729
# PENNY
307.647
Or do I invite a few girlfriends?
309.398

for Hot Dog on a Stick.

person I have ever met in my entire life!
384.432
384.800
**LOL**
386.183
Where do you get off
sending me to shop with your girlfriend?
388.936
389.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
390.104
I don't understand. You were happy
to do this when I hired you.
392.732
392.899
Why are you upset with me now?
394.734
# STUART
394.901
I'm not upset with you,
but Amy's pretty bent out of shape,
397.486
397.653
so she hired me to let you have it.
400.865
402.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
403.492
Well, I suppose turnabout is fair play.

# AMY
412.752
You know, just when I think we're
making progress in our relationship,
415.463
415.546
we revert to our old patterns where
thoughts and feelings go unexpressed.
418.841
419.008
I mean, if he didn't wanna go shopping
with me, why didn't he just say so?
422.011
# BEVERLY
423.095
Maybe he couldn't get a word in edgewise.

No, it's all right, dear.
431.896
432.063
Sheldon has a brilliant
and complicated mind.
435.107
435.274
It's understandable that being in
a relationship with him could be trying.
439.362
# AMY
439.528
I called him "babe" once.
He asked me to get a drug test.

# AMY
461.884
Do you realize it took me five years
to get a massage from him?

a big step for Sheldon.
468.474
# AMY
468.641
Three minutes.
And he used a kitchen timer.

# SHELDON
530.786
Did you make the apology
as sincere as I would have?
533.998
# STUART
534.165
I said, "Sheldon says he's sorry."
536.542
# SHELDON

Yeah, well,
that's laying it on a little thick.
538.711

# LEONARD
542.256
Think it's time
you apologize to her yourself.
544.592
# SHELDON

I suppose so, but if I get out of line,
I'll lose my spot.
547.803

I'm happy to hold your place

Hello, everyone.
Oh, Beverly, good to see you.
602.525
602.691
I'd love to chat, but there's a line
that could start moving any minute,
605.486
605.569
so let's do this.
607.238
606.700
**LOL**
607.404
Amy, a proper apology
requires three steps.
609.365
609.532
Step one, an admission of wrongdoing.
Amy, I was wrong.
612.451
613.200
**LOL**
612.618
Step two, a promise
never to repeat said action.
615.454
615.621
Amy, that action will never be repeated,
and that's a promise.
618.415
618.800
**LOL**
618.582
Step three,
an earnest request for forgiveness.
620.459
620.626
Amy, I hope you can forgive me,
and I hope you do it right now
623.212
623.379
'cause there's an Uber waiting downstairs,

Oh, thanks, you're a peach.

And Beverly, we'll catch up soon.
634.766
634.849
Bernadette, it's a pleasure, as always.
Penny, you have spinach in your teeth.

How long have I had spinach in my teeth?

Maybe not. Leonard?
656.078
656.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
657.246
So, when the aliens brought you back,
they just left the probe in?
660.916

**LOL**
# SHELDON
663.460
I'm back.
664.211
# LEONARD
664.211
Hey, how'd it go?
664.962
# SHELDON
665.129
It went well.
666.213
666.380
You know, I've learned that
if you never say you're sorry,
668.174
668.257
the times you do
really puts them on their heels.
670.426
671.000
**LOL**

Stuart, I relieve you of your line duties.

# STUART
674.805
Anyone else need anything before I go?

# HOWARD
676.640
I'll give you a dollar
if you make fun of Raj.
679.018
679.600
**LOL**

That's mean.
681.082
# HOWARD

You look like Tigger
if Tigger looked like a jackass.

If you ever need a reference

Hey, guys.
692.781
# WOMAN
# SHELDON
694.950
Did you see that?
696.285
696.452
He just cut the line.
697.870
# LEONARD
698.037
He's just joining his friends, it's fine.
699.539
# SHELDON
699.622
No, it's not fine.
It is a breach of line etiquette.
703.209
702.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
703.375
We're near the front of the line.
We'll get in either way.
706.170
# SHELDON
706.337
What if every person in front of us
lets someone out?
708.214
707.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
708.297
We'd still get in.
709.381
# SHELDON
709.548
What if each of those people
let someone out?
710.716
# LEONARD
710.799
Still get in.
711.926
712.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
712.092
Then each of those people let someone out?
713.261
# LEONARD
713.344
We'd still get in, but first I'd hit you
over the head with his stick chair.
716.513
717.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
719.725
Excuse me.
720.642
# LEONARD
720.642
Oh, please don't.
721.560
# SHELDON
721.727
I couldn't help but notice
that you cut the line.
724.313
# MAN
724.772
Oh, uh, I'm with my friends. It's cool.
726.899
# SHELDON
727.066
No, it's not cool.
729.693
730.400
**LOL**
730.819
If there were reserved seating,
we all had tickets, that'd be fine,
733.822
733.989
but this line is first-come, first-served.
735.449
735.532
Not "show up tardy
and nevertheless be first-served."
738.327
738.494
Right here.
739.203
# LEONARD
739.203
No.
739.912
741.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
743.082
You need to go to the back of the line.
744.642
# MAN
745.167
Who made you line monitor?
747.336
# SHELDON
747.503
Mrs. Wunch in fourth grade.
749.505
750.300
**LOL**
751.632
And my slogan was, "A line
this straight is a line that's great."
754.260
755.000
**LOL**
# MAN
756.845
ls this guy for real?
757.930
# LEONARD
758.097
Boy, I wish I could say no.
760.266
761.100
**LOL**
# BEVERLY
763.185
That was very nice of Sheldon
to apologize.
765.646
# AMY
765.813
Well, he's come a long way,
768.107
768.274
or a short way very slowly,
so it feels like a long way.
772.444
773.100
**LOL**
# BEVERLY
773.946
Your relationship with him is fascinating.
776.490
776.657
I'm preparing to write a book
on high-achieving couples,
779.493
779.660
and I would love to interview
the both of you.
781.454
# AMY
781.537
Oh, sure, I'll talk to Sheldon about it.
784.665
784.832
You know, Bernadette's husband's
a former astronaut.
786.709
# BEVERLY
786.792
Really?
787.960
788.127
Do you think he would be interested
in being interviewed as well?
790.754
# BERNADETTE
790.921
Do I think he'd be interested?
792.548
792.715
Sometimes I hear him
pretending to be interviewed
794.550
794.633
when he's alone in the bathroom.
796.051
797.000
**LOL**
# BEVERLY
797.803
Wonderful, I'll give you
my contact information.
800.347
# BERNADETTE
802.057
Um, you should
probably talk to Penny, too.
804.685
# BEVERLY
806.061
About what?
807.104
807.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
809.732
Okay, you know what, this is ridiculous.
811.734
811.900
I've been trying to make
a connection with you all day,
813.903
813.986
and clearly I'm getting nowhere.
815.529
# BEVERLY
816.322
Well, are you seeking a connection
or just some form of validation?
819.825
# PENNY
820.576
What I was seeking was
some sort of friendship,
822.416
822.536
but at this point I'll take you
not insulting me to my face.
824.997
# BEVERLY
825.164
My intention was never to insult you.
827.249
# PENNY
827.416
You've been doing it all day.
Do you even know what an insult is?
830.294
# BEVERLY
830.461
Well, it's not a clinical term,
832.629
832.796
but one example would be
your marrying my son and not inviting me
836.091
836.258
or even telling me
the wedding was taking place.
838.260
# PENNY
841.847
Okay, good example.
843.098
844.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
847.186
What about Joss Whedon's work
makes you think he'd be okay
850.189
850.356
with rule-breakers and line-cutters?
852.107
852.700
**LOL**
# MAN
852.274
The Avengers are rule-breakers, being
vengeful is in their job description.

# SHELDON
858.530
They work for S.H.I.E.L.D.,
859.823
859.990
which is a sanctioned department
of the U.S. government.
862.201
862.368
Now, do you work for a sanctioned
department of the U.S. government?
865.371
# MAN
865.537
As a matter of fact I do,
866.955
867.122
at a little place called the DMV.
869.875
870.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
872.044
He's got him there.
The "D" even stands for department.
875.297
876.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
877.132
Excuse me,
can I please see a show of hands?
879.843
880.010
Who here takes issue
with this person cutting the line?
882.888
# MAN
885.474
Told you.
886.600
# SHELDON
887.393
Well, what a sad state of affairs.
889.395
889.561
Now that you've all been
so ground down by life,
891.980
892.147
you don't even notice
when someone disrespects you.
894.025
# HOWARD
894.108
I can't believe we're gonna get beat up,
and it's not because of your chair.

# SHELDON
896.902
It's time for you to wake up.
898.422
898.200
**LOL**
899.363
You know, right now,
at the back of this line,
901.407
901.573
there's a movie fan like you
who's not going to get in
904.243
904.410
because this person simply doesn't care.
906.870
907.037
Yeah, well, 61 years ago,
908.414
908.580
there was another person
at the back of the line,
910.499
910.582
and her name was Rosa Parks.
912.668
913.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
916.588
Okay, you may have to pretend you're black
to get us out of here.
919.758
920.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
921.593
Let's all follow in that brave woman's
footsteps and stand up for ourselves.
926.098
926.265
Now, and I realize that
she stood up by remaining seated,
928.976
929.143
but now is not the time
to enjoy the irony of that.
930.978
931.061
Now, I ask you again,
who here takes issue with this person
934.773
932.400
**LOL**
# WOMAN
934.940
Why should we listen to you?
You cut the line yourself.
936.942
# SHELDON
937.025
I most certainly did not.
939.153
# WOMAN
939.319
I saw you.
941.029
# MAN
942.197
If you're feeling dizzy,
it's because the tables have turned.
945.826
946.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
948.203
Excuse me, I paid someone
to wait in line for me,
951.248
951.415
and then when I arrived, he left.
953.375
953.542
So what you saw, my good woman,
was swapsies, not cutsies.
957.129
957.300
**LOL**
957.296
No, no, no, no, no, wait.
958.547
958.714
I ask you again, show of hands,
who here takes issue with
961.034
961.133
Stop moving! He's gonna get in!
962.509
# LEONARD
962.676
Buddy, let it go.
963.928

You did everything you could.

No, I could've done more.

967.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
969.725
Now, now.
970.809
970.976
You denigrated the memory
of a great civil rights pioneer.
973.187
973.270
That's all anyone could ask.
974.390
975.200

To be honest, I'm surprised
you cared about the wedding at all.
981.445
# BEVERLY
981.612
I'm still human, Penny.
983.739
983.906
Not getting invited to my own
son's wedding is difficult to ignore.
987.326
# AMY
987.493
I know how you feel.
She didn't invite any of us.
990.621
# PENNY
990.787
It was spur of the moment.
992.372
# BERNADETTE
992.539
Well, we did get to see
a live stream of it on the Internet.
995.209
# BEVERLY
995.375
I could've watched it on the Internet?
997.586

Thank you.

1004.551
So, if we would've asked you
to come to Vegas to see us get married,
1006.971
1007.054
you would've come?
1008.096
# BEVERLY
1008.931
No, I would've said
you're making a huge mistake,
1011.308
1011.475
but an invitation would've been nice.
1013.477
1014.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
1015.687
You really think we made a mistake?
1017.439
# BEVERLY
1018.273
At the time I did,
but I've never seen Leonard so happy,
1023.111
1023.278
so perhaps I was wrong.
1024.780
# PENNY
1026.615
Wow.
1027.616
1028.367
Okay, well, how about this?
1030.953
1031.119
Maybe while you're still in town, Leonard
and I can have another small ceremony,
1036.083
1036.250
you know, if you're interested.
1037.626
# BEVERLY
1038.794
I would find that perfectly acceptable.
1040.796

She would find it perfectly acceptable.

once an astronaut leaves the planet,
1074.037
1071.000

he's a hero
to all the nations of the Earth?
