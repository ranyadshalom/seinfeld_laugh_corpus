Okay, Raj...

4.839
...hand me the number six
Torx screwdriver.

# SHELDON
8.968
Stop.
10.177
11.178
We can't do this. It's not right.
12.972
# RAJ
13.139
Sheldon, you have got two choices.
14.765
14.932
Put a bigger hard drive in the TiVo
or delete stuff before we go out of town.
18.519
# SHELDON
18.686
But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.
21.564
22.273
The warranty is a sacred covenant
we've entered into with the manufacturer.
26.193
26.360
He offers to stand by his equipment.
28.029
28.195
We in return agree not to violate
the integrity of the internal hardware.
31.741
31.907
This little orange sticker is all
that stands between us and anarchy.
36.871
37.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
38.205
Okay,
then we won't touch the hard drive.
40.041
40.207
We'll just erase the first season
of Battlestar.
42.960
45.087
There. We're outlaws.
46.714
47.000
**LOL**
48.591
Here you go, Leonard. ls this big enough?
50.364
# LEONARD
50.364
It's perfect.
52.136
53.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
54.472
For taking daffodils to your unicorn.
58.601
58.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
58.976
It's just for my notebooks.
Thanks, Penny.
61.187
# PENNY
61.354
I love San Francisco.
I wish I was going with you.
63.939
# SHELDON
64.106
I understand your envy.
65.316
65.483
This is a can't-miss symposium.
67.526
67.693
There are going to be discussions
on bioorganic cellular computer devices...
71.322
71.489
...advancements
in multi-threaded task completion...
73.908
74.075
...plus a round table on the non-equilibrium
Green's Function approach...
77.745
77.912
...to the photoionization process
in atoms.
80.122
81.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
81.248
When I go, I usually just get hammered
and ride the cable cars.
84.877
84.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
85.252
This conference is a big thing.
86.921
87.088
The keynote address
is delivered by George Smoot.
89.465
# PENNY
89.924
Oh, my God. The George Smoot?
91.801
# LEONARD
91.967
You've heard of him?
93.386
# PENNY
93.386
Of course I haven't.
94.804
94.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
96.013
George Smoot
is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist...
98.683
98.849
...one of the great minds of our time.
100.726
100.893
His work in black body form...
102.436
102.603
...and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation...
105.606
105.773
...cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.
109.068
# PENNY
109.235
It's kind of a funny name though.
110.945
111.112
Smoot.
113.114
113.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
115.950
It's like talking to a chimp.
117.576
117.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
119.203
Okay, now that I've been completely
insulted, have a good flight.
122.331
# LEONARD
122.498
Yeah, I wish.
124.062
# SHELDON
124.062
We're not flying. We're taking the train.
125.626
# PENNY
125.793
Oh, cool.
126.877
# HOWARD
127.044
Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as flying
and costs almost twice as much.
131.757
132.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
133.134
Well then why are you doing it?
134.364
# LEONARD
134.364
Well, we had a vote.
135.594
135.761
Three voted for airplane,
Sheldon voted for train.
138.180
138.347
So we're taking the train.
140.808
140.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
141.642
Don't say it like that, Leonard.
Say it like, "We're taking the train!"
146.021
# LEONARD
173.132
We're going to the Apple store
to make fun of the Genius Bar.
175.885
176.051
You wanna come?
177.553
177.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
177.928
Oh, I always enjoy that,
but I'm a little busy.
181.265
# LEONARD
181.432
What are you doing?
182.516
# SHELDON
182.683
I'm simplifying the task of packing
for our trip.
184.977
185.144
See, by attaching RFID tags
to my clothing...
187.188
187.354
...it will enable my laptop to read
and identify the items with this wand.
191.317
191.484
Then cross-reference them against
destination, anticipated activity spectrum...
195.154
195.321
...weather conditions,
duration of trip, etc.
198.199
196.800
**LOL**
199.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
201.660
Well, that does sound much simpler.
203.704
203.600
**LOL**
205.498
How long is this gonna take?
206.791
# SHELDON
206.957
Assuming I can keep up this pace,
three hours 11 minutes.
209.627
209.794
Plus however long it takes to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.
213.672
213.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
214.548
Wow.
215.716
216.050
Teasing the guys at the Apple store
seems a little redundant now.
219.303
219.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
219.470
I don't follow.
221.118
# LEONARD
221.118
I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.
222.765
# SHELDON
226.101
Socks, one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

What on earth are you doing?
246.872
# RAJ
247.581
Whatever it is,
I'm guessing we're doing it wrong.
250.417
250.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
250.584
Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight...
254.338
254.505
...one of the great American trains operating
on one of the classic American routes.
259.260
260.000
**LOL**
259.426
On this side,
you'll see panoramic ocean vistas...
262.263
262.429
...inaccessible
to any other form of transportation.
265.224
265.391
While on your side
you'll be treated to 350 miles...
268.686
268.853
...of Costcos, Jiffy Lubes and cinder block
homes with above-ground pools.
272.606
272.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
275.025
Come on, Raj.
276.193
# RAJ
276.193
What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?

# SHELDON
279.113
No.
280.531
280.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
281.615
Why not?
282.700
# SHELDON
282.700
That's over the wheelbase.
283.784
283.951
Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics...
287.121
287.288
...of a pre-1980 Pullman-built
Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?
291.166
# LEONARD
291.333
Sheldon,
we've been on this train 90 seconds...
293.460
292.000
**LOL**
293.627
...and you've already said
a thousand words.
295.880
296.046
Just tell us where to sit and shut up.
298.883
298.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
300.926
Here.
302.303
302.469
I'm hoping once you reap
the endorphic rewards...
305.139
305.306
...of the steady clickety-clack
of steel wheels on polished rails...
308.475
308.642
...your sour disposition will abate.
310.144
# LEONARD
310.144
Yeah, maybe.
311.645
311.812
Back in the 21st century, people are raising
tray tables and putting seat-backs upright...
317.151
317.318
...because it's time to land
in San Francisco.
320.321
319.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
320.654
It's not so bad really.
At least these trains have modern plumbing.
323.824
323.991
In India, you squat over a hole in the
train and expose your naked buttocks...
327.661
327.828
...to the chilly air of Rajasthan.
329.663
329.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
330.331
He is referring, of
course, to third class...
332.416
332.583
...on Indian Railways' magnificent
Ranakpur Express...
335.252
335.419
...and its 1200-kilometer journey
from Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.
339.965
# LEONARD
340.132
Oh, look.
Now he's boring on an international scale.
342.927
343.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
344.678
Holy crap, look.
347.348
# LEONARD
348.849
Is that who I think it is?
350.017
# HOWARD
350.017
It can't be.
351.185
351.352
What would Summer Glau
be doing riding the train'?
353.771
# LEONARD
353.938
Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.
358.192
357.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
358.359
Unlikely.
That's a television show, Leonard.
360.986
361.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
361.737
Thank you.
363.197
# SHELDON
363.530
If Skynet did exist in the future, a perfect
way to infiltrate and destroy mankind...
368.369
368.535
...would be to send Terminators back
as actors...
370.788
370.955
...who have played Terminators
in films and television...
373.624
374.200
**LOL**
373.791
...lulling us into a false sense
of security, i.e.:
376.126
376.293
"That's Summer Glau
from The Sarah Connor Chronicles.
378.712
378.879
No, Summer, don't kill me!
I'm pro-robot."
381.256
382.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
384.843
At least he's off the train crap.

390.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
392.226
Sheldon, I owe you an apology.
393.644
393.811
Taking the train was a stroke of brilliance.
I've actually got a shot at a Terminator.
398.065
397.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
398.232
Please. When it comes to Terminators...
400.067
400.234
...you've got a better shot of scoring
with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

403.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
404.822
You're overlooking something.
406.240
406.407
I have 11 hours with her
in a confined space.
410.869
411.500
**LOL**
411.453
Unless she's willing to jump off
a moving train...
413.747
413.914
...tuck and roll down the side of a hill,
she will eventually succumb...
417.543
417.710
...to the acquired taste
that is Howard Wolowitz.
422.172
421.700
**LOL**

425.050
My money's on tuck and roll.
426.885
426.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
427.761
I'm confused.
428.846
429.013
I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.
433.726
# HOWARD
433.892
Let me explain to you how this works.
435.727
# SHELDON
435.727
All right.
437.563
438.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
437.730
That's Summer Glau.
438.981
# SHELDON
438.981
Yes?

441.066
That's it.

442.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
443.444
Hang on a sec.
444.528
444.695
Why do you get first crack at her?
446.300
# HOWARD
446.300
Uh, well, let's see. Couple reasons.
447.906
448.073
One, I saw her first.
449.867
# RAJ
450.034
No, you didn't. I did.
451.118
# HOWARD
451.952
Fair enough. But then let me move on
to number two.
454.621
453.300
**LOL**
454.788
Unlike you, I can actually talk to women
when I'm sober.
458.375
# RAJ
458.542
You fail to take into account
that even mute, I am foreign and exotic...
462.629
462.796
...while you, on the other hand,
are frail and pasty.
466.633
466.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
467.801
Well, you know the old saying.
469.636

Pasty and frail, never fail.

**LOL**
# LEONARD
475.642
Excuse me, but what about me?
477.811
477.978
Why don't I get a shot?
479.229
# HOWARD
479.396
Fine, go ahead, take a shot.
482.775
# LEONARD
484.151
I've already got a gorgeous blonde
back home I can't score with.
487.112
487.279
I think I'll let you two take this one.
489.114
489.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
489.406
Sheldon, is there a place on this train
to get alcohol?
491.950
# SHELDON
492.117
Interesting that you ask.
493.327
493.494
The Coast Starlight recently added
the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car.
496.830
496.997
Built in 1956 and originally known as
the Santa Fe Lounge Car, the lower level
501.251
498.000

# RAJ
501.418
Which way?
502.294
502.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
502.294
Upper level is a bar...
503.170
503.337
...that offers wine tastings
if you're going as far as Portland.
506.423
506.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
507.674
Aren't you gonna go talk to her?
509.134
# HOWARD
509.301
I will.
I'm just working on my opening line.
511.678
# LEONARD
511.845
She's probably heard every possible line,
Howard.
514.098

**LOL**
514.264
Why don't you try, "Hello?"
515.682

515.849
No, no, no.
That always creeps girls out.
518.102
517.900
**LOL**
518.727
I need to come up with something that's
funny, smart and delicately suggests...
523.524
523.690
...that my sexual endowment
is disproportionate to my physical stature.
527.444
527.300

You're gonna need more than 11 hours.

Oh no.
533.033
# LEONARD

What's the matter?
534.597
# SHELDON
534.597
I forgot my flash drive.
535.994
# LEONARD
536.161
So?
537.225
# SHELDON
537.225
So we have to go back.
538.288
539.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
538.705
Okay, Sheldon, I'm gonna say, "Why?"
540.707
540.874
And your answer cannot be
"Because I forgot my flash drive."
545.129
544.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
545.295
You don't understand.
546.380
546.547
My flash drive has my paper
on astrophysical probes...
549.007
549.174
...of M-theory effects
in the early universe...
551.301
551.468
...l was gonna give to George Smoot
at the conference.
554.054
# LEONARD
554.221
Why do you have to give your paper
to George Smoot?
557.057
# SHELDON
557.224
It's brilliant. He needs to read it.
560.060
559.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
560.936
So you'll send him an email
when we get back.
563.063
# SHELDON
563.230
Then I won't get to see
his face light up as he reads it.
566.316
566.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
566.483
Right. Of course.
567.901
# SHELDON
567.901
Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.
569.319
# LEONARD
569.486
Well, there's nothing you can do about it,
so relax.
572.197
572.364
Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack
of the steel wheels on the polished rails.
576.743
577.100

So, where you gals headed?

620.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
621.121
Okay, I've found the perfect solution.
623.248
623.415
We get off the train at the next stop
in Oxnard.
625.626
625.792
We then take the 1:13 train
back to Union Station.
629.129
629.296
We take a cab back,
get my flash drive...
631.423
630.000
**LOL**
631.590
...and race to San Luis Obispo, assuming
the lights are with us, minimal traffic...
635.719
635.886
...we'll meet the train.
637.262
637.500

Boy, you take all the fun out of it for me.
644.269
644.436
But, look, Penny's home.
645.520
645.687
Why don't we call her, have her get
your flash drive and e-mail you the paper?
649.483
# SHELDON
649.650
But the flash drive
is in a locked drawer in my desk.
652.152
# LEONARD
652.319
So?
653.404
# SHELDON
