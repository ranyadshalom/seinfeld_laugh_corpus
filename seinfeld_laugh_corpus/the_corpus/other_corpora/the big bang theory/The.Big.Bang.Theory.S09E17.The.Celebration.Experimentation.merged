So Sheldon, there's something
I've been wanting to talk about,
6.012
6.095
but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.
8.097
# LEONARD
8.348
Way to narrow it down to everything.
10.183
11.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
12.268
What is it?
13.269
# AMY
13.436
Well, your birthday is coming up
and you've never let us celebrate it,
15.814
15.897
and I was hoping maybe this year we could.
18.274
# SHELDON
18.441
Oh. I suppose
that's a discussion we could have.
21.069
22.600
**LOL**
# AMY
26.950
Okay, great. I mean,
28.284
28.451
it doesn't have to be a big party
or anything. I was just
31.120
31.300
**LOL**
35.458
Where'd he go?
36.626
# PENNY
36.834
Wait a minute.
37.877
38.044
You mention his birthday and he vanishes?
40.213
# LEONARD
40.880
Well, where has that information been
this whole time?
43.633
70.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
72.954
Well, where is he?
73.997
# AMY
74.163
Sheldon?
75.164
# LEONARD
75.164
I'll check his room.
76.165
# SHELDON
76.332
Surprise!
77.584
# PENNY
77.750
Oh, my God!
78.251
# SHELDON
78.251
Why?
78.751
79.100
**LOL**
80.086
Just one example
of how birthdays can be terrible.
83.339
83.600
**LOL**
83.715
Now, can we please drop this subject
and pick a new one?
87.093
87.260
You know, I suggest, "How thick can
a soup get before it becomes a stew?"
91.055
91.222
You know, that answer,
it may surprise you.
93.516
94.000
**LOL**
# AMY
94.601
I'm sorry I brought it up.
96.269
# PENNY
96.436
Yeah, what is the problem?
ls it about getting older?
98.563
# SHELDON
98.730
Please, look at this porcelain skin.
101.024
101.190
I'm like a human sink.
102.734
103.700
**LOL**
# AMY
105.528
But it's the one day a year
that's just all about you.
108.990
# LEONARD
109.157
One day.
110.199
111.000
**LOL**
115.038
Right.
116.205
116.500
**LOL**
# AMY
117.582
Can you please just tell me why?
119.459
# SHELDON
121.044
Fine.
122.128
123.046
As you know, I have a twin sister
with whom I obviously share a birthday.
127.383
127.759
Every year we'd have a party.
129.218
129.385
No one I invited would ever come
because they didn't like me.
132.055
# AMY
133.890
I'm sorry.
134.891
# SHELDON
135.058
That part wasn't so bad,
I didn't like them either.
137.393
137.800
**LOL**
137.560
But then I'd inevitably spend
the whole day
140.021
140.188
being tortured by my sister's friends.
142.690
# PENNY
143.149
Aw. Poor thing.
144.567
# SHELDON
144.734
When I was six, they told me
Batman was coming to my party.
147.111
147.278
I waited by the door for hours.
148.738
148.905
Closest thing to Batman I saw
was when a robin flew into the window.
152.909
153.500
**LOL**
# AMY
154.911
You realize none of those things
would happen now?
157.538
# SHELDON
157.872
I do.
158.915
159.082
But why do you care
if I celebrate my birthday at all?
161.584
# AMY
162.085
Well,
163.127
163.294
you made my last birthday so memorable,
I wanted to return the favor.
166.714
# PENNY
167.298
You know, if you had a party now, you have
plenty of friends who would love to come.
170.468
# LEONARD
170.551
And we live here, so we have no choice.
172.111
# PENNY
172.261
Yeah.
173.346
173.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
175.640
Very well.
176.683
176.849
You may celebrate my life
by throwing a party
178.560
178.643
with cake, presents,
and a shower of admiration and love.
181.938
182.105
But then you owe me big time.
183.815
184.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
187.443
You have any idea what
you're getting Sheldon for his birthday?
189.946
# RAJ
190.113
He's been fascinated
with dinosaurs lately.
191.823
191.989
Maybe we could get him a fossil.
193.491
# LEONARD
194.117
Just don't get anything Jurassic.
195.618
195.785
He feels like that whole chunk of time
has gone Hollywood.
198.621
199.900
**LOL**
202.125
You know, he told a sad story
about how his sister tricked him
206.170
206.337
into thinking Batman
was coming to his party.
208.881
# HOWARD
209.257
That's funny, let's do that.
211.843
212.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
213.469
Maybe we could get Batman
to actually show up.
215.596
# RAJ
216.139
You mean, some guy in a lame suit?
217.682
# LEONARD
217.849
Or a real Batman.
219.058
219.225
Hey, Stuart,
220.268
220.435
didn't you try to get Adam West
to do a signing here once?
222.937
# STUART
223.104
Yeah, but there was kind of
a scheduling conflict.
225.440
225.606
He wanted to know when he'd get paid,
228.317
228.484
and I wouldn't tell him.
230.153
230.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
232.321
Can I get his contact info?
233.781
# STUART
233.990
Sure.
234.991
235.158
But just so you know, he's kind of a diva.
237.869
# LEONARD
238.035
He is?
238.702
# STUART
238.702
Oh, yeah.
239.370
239.537
He won't take the bus,
he won't pack his own lunch.
241.748
242.248
He won't let you spend the night
on his couch.
244.048
244.700
**LOL**
# AMY
247.670
Okay.
So, how do you feel about party balloons?
250.256
# SHELDON
250.423
Mylar balloons, yes.
252.175
252.341
Latex balloons, no.
253.718
253.885
Water balloons, I will jump off the roof
and aim for your car.
257.764
257.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
259.015
All right, what about music?
260.433
# SHELDON
260.600
I enjoy marching bands
and Tibetan throat singing.
264.520
# PENNY
265.313
No music it is.
266.522
267.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
268.024
What kind of cake do you like?
269.317
# SHELDON
269.650
Well, my favorite is chocolate
with strawberry frosting, three layers,
273.321
273.488
and if there's writing on it,
make sure it's not all caps.
275.948
276.115
I don't need my dessert yelling at me.
277.867
278.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
281.871
Hey, so what was Adam West like
on the phone?
284.290
# LEONARD
284.457
Nice guy.
285.541
285.708
But it was a little weird
to hear Batman say,
287.585
287.752
"Don't ring the doorbell
or my poodles will go crazy."
290.505
291.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
292.173
You know, Adam West is my favorite Batman.
295.009
295.176
Well, after Michael Keaton, Christian Bale
298.054
298.221
and Batman from The Lego Movie.
300.097
300.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
301.557
Don't say that to him.
302.809
# RAJ
303.392
What? He beat out George Clooney,
and that's something.
305.561
305.812
Like, I love me some Clooney.
307.688
# LEONARD
308.981
Don't say that to anyone.
310.608
311.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
313.694
Thank you so much for helping us, Stuart.
315.655
# STUART
315.822
I was just glad to be invited.
319.033
319.200
To be honest, I don't always feel
like I'm part of the group.
321.786
# PENNY
321.953
Okay, sweetie, we're on the clock here.
323.037
323.120
Can you hate yourself
and frost at the same time?
325.665
325.700
**LOL**
# BARRY
327.583
Hello. Hope I'm not too early.
329.085
# BERNADETTE
329.252
Not at all. Come on in.
330.253
# BARRY
330.419
And how is the radiant mommy-to-be?
332.880
331.500
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
333.047
Doing great!
334.340
# STUART
335.383
You-- You're pregnant?
336.384
# BERNADETTE
336.384
Yeah.
337.385
# STUART
338.886
Sounds like something
a member of the group might know.
341.514
# PENNY
342.431
Yeah.
Birthday party first, pity party later.
344.725
345.000
**LOL**
348.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
348.396
Are you crazy?
349.564
349.730
How can you put Michael Keaton
in front of Christian Bale?
353.442
# ADAMWEST
353.609
Oh, please.
354.986
355.300
**LOL**
357.822
Even my poodles know Bale's overrated.
361.200
361.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
362.243
Thank you!
363.244
363.411
That's why I say Keaton's number one.
365.037
365.204
He brought a sense of humor to the role.
366.831
# ADAM
366.998
Well, if you're gonna factor in
a sense of humor,
369.792
368.600
**LOL**
369.959
well, I should be at the top of the list.
372.003
372.900
**LOL**
373.588
It should be me, Keaton, Kilmer,
376.090
376.800
**LOL**
376.465
LEGO, Bale,
378.134
378.301
and that pretty boy Clooney.
380.011
380.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
383.180
Really? You're ahead of Bale?
385.266
385.433
The man who personified the words,
"I'm Batman"?
388.811
389.700
**LOL**
# ADAM
390.313
I never had to say, "I'm Batman."
391.814
391.981
I showed up, people knew I was Batman.
395.276
395.400
**LOL**
396.819
Everywhere I went,
on the TV show, mall openings,
400.364
401.157
Julie Newmar's bungalow.
403.659
404.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
406.245
I'm sold. You're ahead of Bale.
408.497
409.200
**LOL**
# ADAM
409.999
There's another reason
I should be higher on the list.
412.335
413.044
All those other guys
had muscles built into their costumes.
417.214
414.700
**LOL**
417.381
All I had in my batsuit
was 100% grade A West.
423.012
418.900
**LOL**
423.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
425.973
Can we just all agree
we're worried about Affleck?
428.225
# LEONARD
428.392
Sure.
429.331
# RAJ
429.331
Yeah. Of course.
430.269
# ADAM
432.688
What's an Affleck?
433.689
434.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
437.151
Is there a reason
I had to leave my own apartment?
439.528
# AMY
439.779
Well, I think they just want you to see it
for the first time all decorated.
442.865
# SHELDON
443.532
But who's gonna tell them
they're doing it wrong?
446.410
446.700
**LOL**
# AMY
448.079
Well, I'm sure they'll ask you
to give a speech,
449.789
449.872
and that's when
you just tear them a new one.
452.375
452.200
**LOL**
454.752
I have to say, you--
You do look good in that suit.
457.129
# SHELDON
457.296
Oh. Thank you.
458.631
# AMY
459.548
Maybe later I'll get to see you
in your birthday suit.
463.052
463.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
467.390
But this is my birthday suit.
469.266
469.700
**LOL**
471.602
Are you having a stroke?
473.562
474.200
**LOL**
475.147
Because that's the kind of thing
that just ruins a birthday party.
477.747
477.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
480.653
So, Mother, I'm surprised you came
all this way for Sheldon's birthday.
483.739
# BEVERLEY
483.906
I was happy to.
484.949
485.116
He did come to my 60th.
486.867
# LEONARD
487.702
Oh! You had a party for your 60th?
490.746
490.700
**LOL**
# BEVERLEY
491.664
I wouldn't call it a party.
493.124
493.290
Just a few close friends.
494.834
495.600
**LOL**
496.836
And your sister and brother.
498.254
499.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
501.007
You know, to be fair, we did get married
in Vegas and didn't invite her.
504.176
# BEVERLEY
504.343
And I never did thank you for that, dear.

Are you ready?
514.603
# SHELDON
516.439
lam.
517.606
524.071
Oh!
525.072
525.281
Wait.
526.053
# AMY
526.053
Are you all right?
526.824
# SHELDON
527.033
No, I just... I got a little lightheaded.
529.452
# AMY
529.618
Oh. Do you need a minute?
531.078
# SHELDON
532.872
No.
533.914
534.081
No, if I can walk past that pet shop
with the parrot in the window,
536.792
536.959
I suppose I can do this.
538.753
539.300

Come on, Sheldon. Say something.
552.767
# SHELDON
553.642
Why, thank you all so much for coming.
557.146
557.313
Beverly, Wil Wheaton,

Adam West, for some reason.
561.650

Batman finally came to your party.

Happy birthday, Sherman.

# SHELDON
572.244
Thank you.
573.245
573.537
This is all so thoughtful.
575.498
585.299
Excuse me.
586.342
# ADAM
593.015
I still get paid, don't I?
594.892
595.600
**LOL**
601.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
601.816
Okay.
I'd better go in there and talk to him.
603.859
# AMY
604.026
Well, don't you think
I'm the one who should go in?
606.026
# LEONARD
606.362
No offense, but I've known the guy
a really long time.
608.656
# AMY
609.698
Well, I've, you know,
seen him without pants on.
612.201
613.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
614.411
Again, no offense, but so have I.
616.539
617.100
**LOL**
# AMY
618.040
Well, he's seen me without pants on.
619.500
# LEONARD
619.875
Again, no offense--
621.168
621.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
621.168
Okay, this is ridiculous!
622.461
625.881
Sheldon? Can I come in?
627.675
# SHELDON
629.552
How do you know
I'm not using the facilities?
631.720
# PENNY
631.887
Because you email me
your bathroom schedule once a week
634.390
634.557
even though I've clicked "unsubscribe"
like a thousand times.
637.393
637.900
**LOL**
644.233
So, what's going on?
647.069
# SHELDON
647.403
I don't know.
648.696
648.863
I looked around the room
and I saw all the faces and the presents,
653.033
653.200
and it was just too much.
654.410
# PENNY
655.828
I get that.
656.912
659.665
Hey, you wanna just bring
a few people in here?
661.917
662.084
You know, Wil Wheaton in the bathtub,
Batman on the toilet.
666.088
666.255
It'll be like the weirdest Comic-Con ever.
668.299
668.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
671.343
I know that you worked hard
to put this together.
673.179
673.262
I'm sorry I'm ruining it.
674.930
# PENNY
675.181
Oh... You're not ruining it.
676.265
676.348
Look, at some point, Raj will try
to get everyone to do the Electric Slide.
679.185
679.268
Now that will ruin it.
681.061

**LOL**
# SHELDON

I don't think I can go back out there.

# PENNY

That's fine.
687.818
699.747
You know, I hate that your sister
and her friends used to torture you.
703.209
704.919
But what I hate even more is,
if I was there,
707.379
707.588
I would have tortured you, too.
709.256
# SHELDON
712.218
Based on this pep talk,
I'd say you're still doing it.
714.637
715.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
715.638
My point is, there was a time
717.556
717.723
I never would have been friends
with someone like you,
719.559
719.642
and now,
you are one of my favorite people.
722.686
722.853
So, if what you need
is to spend your birthday in a bathroom,
727.775
728.108
I'm happy to do it with you.
729.485
# SHELDON
732.696
Well, everyone will think I'm weird.
734.531

**LOL**
# PENNY
742.122
Sweetie, you are weird.
743.874
744.100
**LOL**
745.459
Everyone knows you're weird.
747.002
747.169
But they're all still here
because they care about you so much.
751.131
752.466
Hello?
Some of us need to check our hair
754.093
754.176
because we might have a shot
with Leonard's mother!

the last time we talked.

You know, actually, I thought
you'd be living with Sheldon forever.

# PENNY
787.459
Okay, everybody.
788.544
788.711
Sheldon is gonna come back out,
789.879
789.962
but I think he's a little embarrassed,
so let's all be extra nice, okay?
793.882
# BARRY
794.216
What are you looking at me for?
I'm a saint.

Hello, everyone.
804.143
805.227
I'd like to apologize for my behavior.
806.895
807.062
I hope it hasn't put
a damper on the party.
809.023
809.189
So, just, please, enjoy yourselves.
811.567
811.734
That's good.

Um...
823.912
824.079
Thank you all for coming tonight.
826.081
826.248
I know it's customary
for the birthday boy to receive presents,
829.543
829.710
but I feel like I got the greatest gift
the day he was born.
833.255
# SHELDON
834.340
Aw!
835.278
835.278
Hear, hear. Yes.
836.216

Amy, that was lovely.
838.552
839.928
This is fun. Let's do more.

something wonderful about me.

We've known each other a long time,
855.486
855.652
and it is a pleasure to work with you
and call you my friend.

Sheldon, I know that we have had
our ups and downs,
868.457
868.957
but I can honestly say
870.459
870.626
that my life is so much more interesting
because you are in it.
873.170
874.129
We may have met
because you are a fan of Star Trek,
876.673
876.840
but I have become a fan of Sheldon Cooper.
879.218
879.885
Live long and prosper, buddy.
881.012
881.095
And happy birthday.

like, "Happy birthday, dumbass."

933.700
**LOL**
934.064
But I'm not gonna do it.
935.482
935.649
You and I have both grown a lot,
937.234
937.401
and it's just so nice
to see you all again.
