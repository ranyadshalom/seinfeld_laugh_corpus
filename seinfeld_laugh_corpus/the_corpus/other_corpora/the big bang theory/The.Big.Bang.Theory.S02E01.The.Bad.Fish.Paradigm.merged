So, what you're eating
is not technically yogurt.
4.505
4.672
It doesn't have enough
live acidophilus cultures.
6.924
7.091
It's really just ice milk
with carrageenan added for thickness.
10.344
10.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
10.511
Well, that's very interesting.
12.930
# LEONARD
12.930
It's also not pink and has no berries.
15.349
15.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
16.642
Yeah, but it doesn't really
answer my question.
19.020
# LEONARD
19.186
What was your question again?
20.500
# PENNY
20.500
Do you want some?
21.814
# LEONARD
21.981
Ah.
23.482
22.700
**LOL**
23.858
Right. No. I'm lactose intolerant.
24.963
# PENNY
24.963
Right.
26.068
# LEONARD
26.235
So gas.
27.298
# PENNY
27.298
Yeah, got it.
28.362
28.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
29.322
Well, good night.
32.033
37.700
**LOL**
41.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
46.380
What are you doing?
48.049
# LEONARD
48.049
There was a draft.
49.717
49.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
50.301
I didn't feel a draft.
51.677
# LEONARD
52.970
Why don't we just go into your--?
54.868
# PENNY
54.868
Oh, yeah.
56.766
56.932
Maybe we should
slow things down a little.
58.851
# LEONARD
59.018
No, I didn't mean
to go into your apartment to go fast.
61.562
# PENNY
61.729
No, I know.
63.356
62.900
**LOL**
63.648
I know what you meant.
It's just this is only our first date.
66.692
# LEONARD
66.859
Okay. Sure. No problem.
67.902
68.069
Why don't we just figure out
where we're going...
70.363
70.529
...and when we want to get there?
72.657
72.823
And then rate of speed
equals distance over time.
76.702
77.100
**LOL**
78.621
Solve for R.
80.539
80.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
81.624
Or we could just wing it.
83.209
# LEONARD
84.251
That might work too.
86.212
85.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
86.837
Good night, Leonard.

Good night.

Oh, hey, Leonard.
102.478
102.645
How was your date?
103.959
# LEONARD
103.959
Bite me.
105.272
106.000
**LOL**
107.441
Sheldon, how could you just sit there
and let them spy on me'?
110.945
# SHELDON
111.112
They were clever.
112.154
112.321
They exploited my complete lack of interest
in what you were doing.
115.700
115.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
117.034
You should thank us.
When future generations try to determine...
119.995
120.162
...why your relationship with Penny
crashed and burned...
122.790
122.957
...this right here is the black box.
125.918
125.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
126.085
What are you talking about?
The date went fine.
128.879
# RAJ
129.046
She said she wants to slow things down.
130.881
# LEONARD
131.048
Okay, so she said
she wants to slow things down.
133.801
133.968
It's like saying,
"I'm really enjoying this meal.
137.805
137.972
I'm going to slow down and savor it."
140.808
# HOWARD
140.975
No, it's like, "This fish tastes bad...
144.478
144.000
**LOL**
145.229
...so I'm gonna slow down
and spit it out."
148.149
148.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
149.817
You being the fish.
150.985
# LEONARD
150.985
I'm not the fish.
152.153
151.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
152.319
Oh, really?
Did you make a second date?
154.113
# LEONARD
154.280
Well, no. We sort of decided to wing it.
156.845
# SHELDON
156.845
Oh, even I know that's lame.
159.410
158.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
159.910
Okay. All right.
Let's assume your hypothesis.
162.413
162.580
We went to dinner, we talked,
we laughed, we kissed.
166.125
166.292
Where could I have gone wrong?
167.668
# HOWARD
167.835
Think back, Leonard.
The littlest things can set women off.
171.005
171.172
Like, "Hey, the waitress is hot. I bet
we could get her to come home with us."
175.259
175.700
**LOL**
176.135
Or, "How much does your mom weigh?
I wanna know what I'm getting into."
180.181
179.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
180.347
I didn't say anything like that.
182.058
# HOWARD
182.058
Good, because they don't work.
183.768
183.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
184.518
They don't care for it
if you stare at them and hyperventilate.
187.396
187.563
Sadly, that's my home-run swing.
189.940
189.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
190.441
Look, everything went fine.
192.610
192.777
I didn't even have to refer
to my impromptu conversation starters.
196.822
196.800
**LOL**
196.989
That woman across the hall is into me.
199.325
# HOWARD
199.950
Let's go to the tape.
201.535
202.400
**LOL**
203.496
Look at her reaction
to the good-night kiss.
205.623
205.790
No change in respiration, pupils undilated,
no flushing of the chest.
210.169
# RAJ
210.336
Nice close-up, by the way.
212.379
212.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
212.713
Interesting. Her jaws are clenched.
No tongue access.
215.841
216.008
Clearly a bad sign
amongst mating humans.
219.345
218.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
219.720
That's not a bad sign.
221.555
# SHELDON
221.722
Please. You might as well have been
two iguana with no dewlap enlargement.
225.309
225.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
226.101
And the worst sign of all
is you're here and not there.
228.729
# LEONARD
228.896
I'm not there,
because I'm taking things slow.
232.399
232.566
Which, by the way, compared to you guys,
approaches warp speed.
236.028
236.500
**LOL**
237.238
And take down that camera.
240.241
# RAJ
241.784
He was a lot more fun
when he had no hope.
244.745
244.500

Give him time.
249.375
249.100

282.408
Hi.
283.493
# SHELDON
283.493
Oh, hi, Penny.
284.577
284.743
Yeah, FYI, the hot water is inadequate
on Machine 2, so colors only.
288.622
288.789
Four is still releasing the fabric softener
too early in the cycle.
291.834
292.001
So I'd avoid using that for your delicates.
293.669
293.669
Thanks.
295.337
296.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
298.132
Well, good Lord.
299.300
299.466
Why don't you just take your clothes down
to the river and beat them with a rock'?
303.220
303.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
307.975
Sheldon, may I ask you a question?
310.561
# SHELDON
311.061
I would prefer that you not,
but I won't go so far as to forbid it.
314.690
# PENNY
315.691
All right, I heard "yes," so...
317.526
317.600
**LOL**
318.694
Okay, here's my
319.987
320.404
Has Leonard ever dated,
you know, a regular girl?
325.159
# SHELDON
326.327
Well, I assume you're not referring
to digestive regularity.
329.705
330.000
**LOL**
330.956
Because I've come to learn
that such inquiries are inappropriate.
334.251
334.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
335.002
No, I meant has he ever been involved
with someone who wasn't a brainiac?
339.965
# SHELDON
340.132
Oh! Well, a few years ago...
342.343
342.509
...he did go outwith a woman
who had a Ph.D. in French literature.
346.555
346.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
347.348
How is that not a brainiac?
349.704
# SHELDON
349.704
Well, for one thing, she was French.
352.061
351.600
**LOL**
354.063
For another, it was literature.
356.690
356.000
**LOL**
360.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
362.655
So...
364.114
365.407
Do you think that if Leonard
and I keep dating...
367.701
367.868
...he'll eventually get bored with me?
370.287
374.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
376.251
That depends.
377.252
# PENNY
377.252
On what?
378.253
# SHELDON
378.879
Do you have a working knowledge
of quantum physics?
381.340
# PENNY
381.507
No.
382.758
# SHELDON
382.925
Do you speak Klingon?
384.927
384.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
385.469
No.
386.512
# SHELDON
386.887
You know any card tricks?
388.139
# PENNY
388.139
Okay.
389.390
389.000
**LOL**
391.767
I get it. Leonard has no business
being involved with a waitress/actress...
395.771
395.938
...who felt so insecure, that she lied to
him about finishing community college.
400.484
# SHELDON
400.651
Why would you lie about that?
402.194
# PENNY
402.361
He was going on about this college
and that grad school...
405.114
405.280
...and I didn't want him to think
I was some kind of stupid loser.
408.784
# SHELDON
408.951
You thought the opposite of "stupid loser"
was "community-college graduate"?
413.122
415.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
418.002
There are a lot of successful people
in this country...
420.546
420.713
...who are community-college graduates.
422.548
# SHELDON
422.715
Yeah, but you are neither.
424.925
425.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
426.844
Right. Okay, look,
this is between you and me.
429.138
429.304
You cannot tell Leonard any of this.
432.433
# SHELDON
433.600
You're asking me to keep a secret?
435.039
# PENNY
435.039
Yeah.
436.478
# SHELDON
436.645
Well, I'm sorry.
437.813
437.980
You would've had to express that desire
before revealing the secret...
441.233
441.400
...so that I could choose whether I wanted
to accept the covenant of secret-keeping.
445.362
445.100
**LOL**
446.030
You can't impose a secret
on an ex post facto basis.
449.616
449.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
450.909
What?
452.411
# SHELDON
452.578
Secret-keeping is a complicated endeavor.
One has to be concerned...
455.873
456.040
...not only about what one says, but about
facial expressions, autonomic reflexes.
460.210
460.627
When I try to deceive...
461.962
462.129
...l myself have more nervous tics
than a Lyme disease research facility.
466.800
467.300
**LOL**
472.097
It's a joke.
473.140
473.307
It relies on the homonymic relationship
between tick, the bloodsucking arachnid...
477.102
477.269
...and tic, the involuntary
muscular contraction.
479.730
481.500
**LOL**
484.359
I made it up myself.
485.527
486.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
488.363
Okay, look, if Leonard finds out that I lied,
I will absolutely die of embarrassment.
493.368
# SHELDON
493.535
Physiologically impossible.
495.037
495.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
495.037
Oh, Sheldon, please.
496.538
496.705
Look, I'm asking you as a friend.
498.707
# SHELDON
500.084
You're saying that friendship
contains within it...
502.419
502.586
...an inherent obligation
to maintain confidences?
505.172
# PENNY
505.339
Well, yeah.
507.049
# SHELDON
507.049
Interesting.
508.759
508.600
**LOL**
509.301
One more question.
Perhaps I should've led with
511.720
511.887
When did we become friends?
513.972
516.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
516.475
i.e., I couldn't become Green Lantern...
518.185
518.352
...unless I was chosen
by the Guardians of Oa.
520.354
520.521
Given enough startup capital
and an adequate research facility...
523.524
523.690
...l could be Batman.

**LOL**
# LEONARD
529.655
You could be Batman?

If you're not doing anything Friday night,

544.002
You know, I think I have the dinner shift
on Friday.
546.672
# LEONARD
546.839
Okay. What about Saturday?
548.195
# PENNY
548.195
You know, I'm not sure.
549.550
549.716
The manager hasn't posted the schedule.
How about I let you know?
552.719
# LEONARD
552.886
Great.
553.386
553.386
Okay.
553.887
554.054
So you just let me know when you know.
Okay, so-- Oh, God, I am the bad fish.
559.685
559.200
**LOL**
561.436
What did I do wrong?
562.980
# SHELDON
562.980
Why are you asking me?
564.523
564.900
**LOL**
565.065
I have no information
about your interactions with Penny...
568.277
568.443
...nor do I have any method
of learning such things.
571.405
571.600
**LOL**
573.740
LEONARD: What does that mean?
574.699
# SHELDON
574.699
Nothing.
575.659
575.826
You seem to be implying a back channel
between me and Penny...
579.037
579.204
...where, obviously, none exists.
580.559
# LEONARD
580.559
No, I didn't.
581.915
# SHELDON
582.082
I just think you need to be careful
how you phrase things, sir.
585.335

**LOL**
# LEONARD
587.880
What's going on with you?
589.548
# SHELDON
589.548
Well, I might ask you the same question.
591.216
591.383
Why do you drag me into matters
which have nothing to do with me...
595.262
595.429
...but exist between you and Penny,
a person to whom I barely speak?

I'm constitutionally incapable.

That's why I was refused clearance

Forget? You want me to forget?
This mind does not forget.

I haven't forgotten a thing since the day

There doesn't have to be a reason.

Yeah, there kind of does.
715.466
# SHELDON

Not necessarily.
716.925
717.092
This is a classic example
of Mֳ¼nchausen's trilemma.
719.970
720.137
Either the reason is predicated on a series
of sub-reasons leading to regression...
724.099
724.266
...or it tracks back to axiomatic
statements, or it's ultimately circular...
727.894
728.061
...i.e., I'm moving out
because I'm moving out.

I'm still confused.

Excuse me, but isn't hosting guests
