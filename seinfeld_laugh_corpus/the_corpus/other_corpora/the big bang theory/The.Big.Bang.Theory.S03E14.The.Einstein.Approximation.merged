Told you.
689.815
689.700
**LOL**
691.692
So, Mr. Cooper,
you're looking for a job.
695.195
# SHELDON
695.404
A menial job.
697.531
698.115
Like yours.
699.408
700.000
**LOL**
# ASSISTANT
701.535
Why, thank you for noticing.
703.704
703.900
**LOL**
705.038
I'm menial employee of the month.
707.708
707.900
**LOL**
709.376
Do you have a particular field in mind?
711.336
# SHELDON
711.503
I do. For thousands of years...
714.381
714.548
...the lowest classes of the human race
have spent their lives laboring...
718.135
718.302
...to erect monuments
under the lash of betters.
720.721
720.929
Until finally they dropped down
and became one with the dust...
724.641
724.808
...through which they trudged.
726.977
727.144
Do you have anything like that?
729.438
729.100
**LOL**
# ASSISTANT
731.064
No.
732.962
732.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
732.962
Shouldn't you check your database?
734.860
737.321
No.
738.822
738.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
742.326
You didn't really type.
744.244
# ASSISTANT
745.078
I didn't really have to.
747.581
747.200
**LOL**
747.748
So how about construction?
749.666
# SHELDON
749.833
Oh, that would be good.
751.752
751.918
Yeah, sawing, hammering,
eating out of a lunch pail...
755.505
755.672
...as my working-class fellows and I
sit perched precariously on a girder...
759.551
759.718
...high above the metropolis.
761.470
762.100
**LOL**
# ASSISTANT
762.763
No, no. This is putting up sheetrock
at a housing project in Rosemead.
767.976
768.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
768.602
I could do that.
769.269
# ASSISTANT
769.269
Good.
769.936
# SHELDON
770.103
One question.
770.770
# ASSISTANT
770.770
Yes?
771.438
# SHELDON
771.605
What's sheetrock?
773.482
773.300
**LOL**
# ASSISTANT
774.191
Moving on.
776.068
776.610
How about doing deliveries
for a florist?
779.446
# SHELDON
779.613
That seems acceptable.
781.114
# ASSISTANT
781.281
Do you have your own car?
782.678
# SHELDON
782.678
I don't drive.
784.076
783.800
**LOL**
# ASSISTANT
784.618
Of course you don't.
786.244
787.621
Mr. Cooper,
let me just ask you a question.
790.457
790.624
What was your last job?
792.125
# SHELDON
792.292
Senior theoretical particle physicist
at CalTech, focusing on M Theory.
795.962
796.129
Or in layman's terms, string theory.
798.423
# ASSISTANT
799.424
I see.
801.093
801.259
Just give me a second.
802.469
806.431
Security!
809.101
808.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
814.147
Okay.
I'll get those drinks started for you.
817.526
818.151
Behind you.
819.820
819.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
820.570
Sheldon? What the hell are you doing?
823.156
# SHELDON
823.323
Trying to get these tables cleared.
We're slammed.
825.659
826.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
827.327
No, wait. Wait. No, wait.
What are you doing here?
830.163
# SHELDON
830.330
A reasonable question.
831.998
832.165
I asked
833.250
833.417
"What is the most mind-numbing,
pedestrian job conceivable?"
836.962
837.129
Three answers came to mind.
838.505
838.672
A toll booth attendant,
an Apple store genius...
841.091
842.400
**LOL**
843.593
...and what Penny does.
845.011
845.178
Now, since I don't like touching
other people's coins...
849.349
846.000
**LOL**
849.516
...and I refuse to contribute
to the devaluation of the word "genius"...
854.354
854.563
...here I am.
855.856
856.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
856.815
You just walked in
and they hired you?
859.025
859.192
Just like that?
860.173
# SHELDON
860.173
Oh, heavens no.
861.153
861.319
Since I don't need to be paid,
I didn't need to be hired.
864.281
864.448
I simply came in, picked up a tray
and started working for the man.
867.951
867.300
**LOL**
868.994
Let me get that plate out of your way.
871.037
# PENNY
871.204
Sheldon, this is ridiculous.
873.206
# SHELDON
873.373
Is it? Just a moment ago,
I had a minor epiphany...
876.001
876.168
...regarding polymer degradation
phenomenon...
878.336
878.503
...while scraping congealed nachos
off a plate.
880.714
881.000
**LOL**
881.965
Bernadette, table 10 wants their check.
883.258
# BERNADETTE
883.258
Thanks.
884.551
# PENNY
884.718
Sheldon, wait. This isn't even what I do.
I'm a waitress, not a busboy.
888.388
# SHELDON
889.055
You're right. That is more menial.
891.057
891.400
**LOL**
892.601
Hello, I'm Sheldon.
I'll be your server today.
894.811
895.400
**LOL**
896.062
I don't recommend the salmon.
897.522
897.689
I saw it in the kitchen.
899.816
900.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
902.527
All right. One bacon cheeseburger...
906.072
906.239
...breaking two Jewish
dietary restrictions simultaneously.
909.993
910.160
Kudos.
912.037
911.600
**LOL**
912.204
And beer-battered fish and chips.
914.206
914.372
Now, here's your tartar sauce.
I also brought you salsa.
917.250
917.417
A little unconventional,
but I think you'll like it. It's zingy.
921.129
921.800
**LOL**
922.339
And for you, Factory Burrito Grande,
no cheese, no sour cream...
926.927
927.093
...no ugly consequences
from your lactose intolerance.
929.930
930.100
**LOL**

958.291
# RAJ
958.458

960.126

we could buy Sheldon a van.

Well, honey, not to complain...
989.155

you didn't either.

The interference pattern
in the fracture.
1003.753
1004.588
The motion of the wave
through the structure.
1006.965
1007.132
I've been looking at it all wrong.
1009.009
1009.217
I can't consider
the electrons as particles.
1011.636
1011.803
They move through the graphene
as a wave.

1015.724
It's a wave!
