Excuse me.
You're misusing the word "ho."
11.971
12.800
**LOL**
12.972
It's an interjection used to call attention
to a destination, not an object.
16.684

As in, uh, "Land ho!"
or, uh, "Westward ho!"

Hey, guys. What are you doing?

Going out to discover electricity?

**LOL**
# LEONARD
31.490
If you refer to the work of Benjamin
Franklin, he did not discover electricity.
35.328
35.494
He merely used a kite to determine
that lightning consists of electricity.
39.081
39.248
He also invented the Franklin stove,
bifocals and the flexible urinary catheter.

Kite fighting?
51.990
# LEONARD
51.990
Oh, yeah.
52.803
52.970
It's an extremely competitive,
cutthroat sport.
56.223

**LOL**
# SHELDON
56.766
Well, actually,
the risk of throat-cutting is very low.
60.061

On the other hand, severe string burn
is a real and ever-present danger.

No. No, I'm not. So, great.

What was I supposed to do?
She gave me that come-hither look.
220.763

If she gave you any look at all,
it was a you-suck look.
223.933

I would've caught up to her
if I hadn't pulled a hammy.

236.153
# SHELDON
236.570
Well, her actions could be
out of concern for your feelings.
240.616
240.100
**LOL**
240.783
Perhaps she's excluded you
from these gatherings...
243.118
243.285
...because she's scouting for a new mate
and doesn't wanna do it in front of you.
247.039

Oh, how kind of her.
250.626

**LOL**
# SHELDON
251.085
Agreed. Most primates don't show
that sort of discretion.
254.380
254.547
A female bonobo will copulate with
a new male in front of the old one...
258.133
258.300
...without so much as a,
"How do you do?"
260.886
260.900

261.512
You always do this. Ditch me
for a woman you don't have a shot with.
264.807
# HOWARD
264.974
I totally had a shot.
266.433
# RAJ
266.433
With a woman you were chasing in a park.
267.893
268.060
That's not a shot, that's a felony.
269.728
270.200
**LOL**
272.022
What's worse, it cost me
my prized Patang fighting kite.
275.568
276.151
I don't suppose there's any chance
you could give me my kite back?
279.613
277.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
280.030
I'm sorry, Raj,
but the rules of aerial warfare dictate...
283.033
283.200
...that the fallen kite go to the victor.
285.202
285.369
And without rules,
the competition has no meaning.
287.872
288.038
And without meaning, the following
would be an empty

of scrimmage.

The line of scrimmage

In fact, every form of football
except the original, European football.

# SHELDON
645.395
When I have enough to destroy
the human toast...
647.689
647.856
...on the Battlestar
known as Galactica.
650.234
650.100
**LOL**
652.444
Is that what you're wearing
to watch football?
654.655
# LEONARD
655.113
What's wrong with a football jersey?
656.260
# SHELDON
656.260
Nothing.
657.407
657.574
That, however,
appears to be a football cocktail dress.
660.577
661.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
664.122
It's the smallest size they had.
665.749
665.916
Except the one for dogs.
668.293
668.200
**LOL**
669.211
I can't believe they had one for dogs.
671.171
# SHELDON
671.338
Oh, yes. Canine football fans
are a common sight in Texas.
675.092
675.259
Cats, however,
refuse to wear sporting apparel.
678.512
679.554
My sister found that out the hard way.
681.765
681.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
682.849
Anyway, wish me luck.
684.184
# SHELDON
684.184
Leonard, wait.
685.519
685.686
Am I correct in assuming
that your attempt...
688.313
688.480
...to be accepted by Penny's peers
is based on your desire to ensure...
692.693
692.859
...your continuing mating privileges
with her?
695.904
695.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
697.489
Well, I wouldn't put it
exactly that way.
700.033
# SHELDON
700.200
How would you put it?
701.285
# LEONARD
702.619
Yeah, okay, like you said.
704.705
704.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
705.789
Huh. Seems like an awful lot of trouble
to go through for intercourse.
710.377
710.300
**LOL**
711.253
Don't you have access to women
who will do it for money?
714.589
714.800
**LOL**
717.551
By the way, another accepted usage
for the term "ho."
722.222
722.500

# LEONARD
724.266
Goodbye, Sheldon.
725.475
725.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
726.393
Now, hold on.
727.686
727.853
I believe that social convention dictate
you not arrive empty-handed.
731.189
731.356
Would you like to bring
some Cylon toast?
733.984
733.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
734.484
Yeah, no, I'm trying to fit in,
not get laughed at.
738.280

What's funny about Cylon toast?

# HOWARD
757.382
I brought you a little gift.
759.051
759.718
New kite.
761.553
# RAJ
763.096
The kite you made me lose
was an authentic Patang.
765.891
766.058
An Indian kite my brother sent
to me from New Delhi.
768.560
768.727
It took me a day to put together
and two days to paint.
772.022
772.189
This is Hello Kitty.
774.441
774.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
776.902
Yeah, but it comes
with a little coin purse.
780.364
780.000
**LOL**
780.530
Does a Patang?
782.574
# RAJ
783.367
Wow, you just don't get it, do you?
785.202
785.369
Buying me something pretty isn't gonna
make our problem just go away.
789.498
789.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
790.957
Look, I admit I haven't always been
the best friend I could be.
794.669
# RAJ
794.836
You've been a sucky friend.
A sucky, sucky friend.
797.923
797.300
**LOL**

Stipulated.
799.571

And you do it all the time.
800.801
800.967
Last week, we were looking for a phone
with giant numbers for your mother...
805.180
805.400
**LOL**
805.347
...and I realize you're not even there.
806.598
# HOWARD
806.598
I know.
807.849
# RAJ
808.016
And where were you?
809.226
# HOWARD
809.393
Getting shot down by the girl
at Hot Dog on a Stick.
812.604
812.900
**LOL**
813.438
But in my defense, she was gorgeous.
815.440
815.607
And working that squeezer
to make the lemonade...
817.943
818.110
...going up and down
and up and down...
821.238
820.000
**LOL**
821.655
It was like a free pole dance
right in the middle of the food court.
825.742
825.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
826.493
You're impossible.
827.577
# HOWARD

Hey, at least I can talk to women
without being drunk.
831.748
# RAJ
831.915
Excuse me, I have selective mutism,
a recognized medical disorder.
835.836

You're just a douche.

838.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
839.381
No. You know what?
840.465
840.632
Maybe that's what this whole thing
is about.
842.717
842.884
You're not mad at me.
You're mad at yourself.
845.095
# RAJ
845.262
No, I'm mad at you.
I hate myself, but I'm mad at you.

849.349
Look, fine. You're mad at me. I get it.
Now

How about we go
spend the day together?

No, I can see the difference.

That's intentional grounding.
921.671
# SECONDGUY
921.671
Totally.
923.131
# LEONARD
923.298
Yeah--
That completely was a forward pass...
925.550
925.717
...which they threw intentionally
incomplete to avoid loss of yardage...
929.179
929.346
...or to conserve time.
931.097
931.100
**LOL**
931.806
I can't believe they're not penalized
with the loss of a down...
935.060
935.227
...and by having to move the line of
scrimmage back to the spot of the foul.

There's some in the fridge.
963.484
# SHELDON
963.484
You shouldn't keep bread in the fridge.
965.298
965.465
Staleness is caused
by crystallization of the starch...
968.260
968.426
...which occurs faster
at cool temperatures.

Mimesis?
979.833
# SHELDON
979.833
You know, mimesis.
982.190
982.357
An action in which the mimic
takes on the properties...
985.151
985.318
...of a specific object or organism.
988.113
988.280
Mimesis.

1018.018
1018.184
...I'm taking Koothrappali's Patang kite
out for a test run.

and join me?

I don't wanna fly kites, Sheldon.
Come on, we're watching football here.
1027.485

# SHELDON
1027.652
I can see that.
I was providing you with an alternative.
1030.822

A courtesy I was never offered
in similar circumstances.
1036.286

# LEONARD
1038.246
Oh, look at that. The Oklahoma coach
has thrown down a red flag...
1041.291
1041.458
...indicating he's challenging
the ruling on the field.
1044.169
1044.200

1044.336
Hope he's right, because if he's not,
it'll cost him one of his three timeouts.

Yeah, well, it doesn't matter,
because she wasn't really smiling at me.
