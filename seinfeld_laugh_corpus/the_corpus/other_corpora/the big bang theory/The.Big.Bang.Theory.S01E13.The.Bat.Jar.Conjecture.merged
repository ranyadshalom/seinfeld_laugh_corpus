Ooh, more details
about the new Star Trek film.
5.089
5.256
There's going to be a scene
depicting Spock's birth.
9.427
# RAJ
9.594
I'd be more interested in a scene
depicting Spock's conception.
13.180
13.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
13.848
Oh, please. For Vulcans, mating,
or, if you will, Pon farr...
19.353
18.700
**LOL**
19.520
...it's an extremely private matter.
21.146
# LEONARD
21.146
I'd like to know the details.
22.773
22.940
His mother was human. His father
was Vulcan. They couldn't conceive.
26.068
# HOWARD
26.235
Maybe they had to go to a clinic.
Can you imagine Spock's dad...
29.280
29.447
...with a copy of
Pointy Ears and Shapely Rears?
33.159
33.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
34.285
How come on Star Trek
everybody's private parts are the same?
37.496
37.663
No alien lady ever told Captain Kirk,
"Hey, get your thing out of my nose."
42.293
41.600
**LOL**
44.462
Hi. Can you help me?
45.504
45.671
I was writing an e-mail
and the A key got stuck.
47.965
48.132
Now it's just going, "Aaaah."
50.801
# LEONARD
51.135
What'd you spill on it?
52.219
# PENNY
52.219
Nothing.
53.304
54.347
Diet Coke.
55.640
56.891
And yogurt.
58.893
59.060
And a little nail polish.
60.311
61.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
60.478
I'll take a look at it.
62.104
# HOWARD
62.271
Gentlemen, switching
to local nerd news...
65.066
65.232
...Fishman, Chen, Chaudury and McNair
aren't fielding a team...
68.152
68.319
...in the Physics Bowl this year.
70.196
# LEONARD
70.363
You're kidding. Why not?
71.802
# HOWARD
71.802
They formed a barbershop quartet...
73.240
73.407
...and got a gig playing
Knott's Berry Farm.
76.577
76.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
77.244
Wow. So in your world,
you're like the cool guys.
81.916
# HOWARD
82.667
Recognize.
84.835
84.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
86.170
This is our year. With those guys out...
88.130
88.297
...the entire Physics Bowl
will kneel before Zod.
91.008
# PENNY
91.175
Zod?
92.552
# HOWARD
92.552
Kryptonian villain. Long story.
93.928
# RAJ
94.095
Good story.
95.429
96.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
98.766
Count me out.
99.892
# HOWARD
99.892
What? Why?
101.018
# SHELDON
101.185
You want me to use my intelligence
in a tawdry competition?
104.397
104.939
Would you ask Picasso
to play Pictionary?
108.150
108.401
Would you ask Noah Webster
to play Boggle?
111.445
111.100
**LOL**
111.821
Would you ask Jacques Cousteau
to play Go Fish?
114.865
114.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
116.075
Come on, you need a four-person team.
We're four people.
118.828
# SHELDON
118.994
By that reasoning we should also
play bridge, hold up a huppah...
121.997
122.164
...and enter the Olympic bobsled
competition.
125.126
124.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
125.292
Tickets to that, please.
127.294
# LEONARD
128.379
Sheldon, what? Do I need to quote
Spock's dying words to you?
132.216
# SHELDON
132.383
No, don%.
133.467
133.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
134.343
"The needs of the many--"
136.095
# HOWARD
136.262
"Outweigh the needs of the few--"
138.305
# SHELDON
138.472
"Or the one."
140.307
140.474
Damn it, I'll do it.
142.560
# RAJ
168.169
Okay, first order
of Physics Bowl business.
170.880
171.672
We need a truly kick-ass team name.
Suggestions?
175.092
173.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
175.259
How about the Perpetual Motion Squad?
178.637
178.500
**LOL**
178.929
It's beyond the laws of physics,
plus a little heads up for the ladies.
182.933
183.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
183.851
The ladies?
184.977
# HOWARD
184.977
Perpetual Motion Squad...
186.103
186.270
...we can go all night.
188.606
188.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
188.773
I like it.
189.711
# SHELDON
189.711
I don't.
190.649
190.816
Teams are traditionally named after
fierce creatures...
193.360
192.700
**LOL**
193.527
...thus intimidating one's opponent.
195.654
# RAJ
195.821
We could be the Bengal Tigers.
197.323
198.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
197.490
Poor choice. Gram for gram...
199.450
199.617
...no animal exceeds the relative
fighting strength of the army ant.
203.704
203.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
204.371
Maybe so, but you can't incinerate
a Bengal tiger with a magnifying glass.
208.542
209.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
212.171
Let's put it to a vote.
213.255
213.422
All those in favor--
214.339
# SHELDON
214.339
Point of order.
215.257
215.424
I move that any vote on team names
be unanimous.
217.635
217.802
No man should be forced to emblazon
his chest with a Bengal tiger...
220.930
219.400
**LOL**
221.096
...when common sense dictates
it should be an army ant.
224.266
223.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
224.433
Will the gentleman from the great
state of denial yield for a question?
227.770
227.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
228.395
I will yield.
229.584
# LEONARD
229.584
After we go through the exercise...
230.773
230.940
...of an annoying series of votes,
which the gentleman will lose...
234.068
234.000
**LOL**
234.235
...does he intend to quit
if he does not get his way?
236.654
# SHELDON
236.821
He does.
238.510
# LEONARD
238.510
We are the Army Ants. All those in favor?
240.199

**LOL**
# PENNY
242.034
Good afternoon and welcome
to today's Physics Bowl practice round.
245.579
245.746
I'm Penny,
and I'll be your host because...
247.790
247.957
...l didn't have anything else
to do on a Saturday afternoon...
250.876
251.043
...and isn't that just a little sad?
253.629
253.900
**LOL**
255.214
Gentlemen, are you ready?
256.014
# LEONARD
256.014
Yes.
256.814
# SHELDON
# HOWARD
256.924
HOWARD: Fire away.
257.987
# PENNY
257.987
It's none of my business...
259.051
259.218
...but is a guy who can't speak
in front of women gonna hold you back?
262.429
# LEONARD
262.596
Oh, he'll be okay once the women
are mixed into the crowd.
265.307
265.474
He only has a problem
when they're one-on-one and smell nice.
269.019
268.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
269.186
Oh, thanks, Raj. It's vanilla oil.
271.522
# LEONARD
271.856
I was actually the one who noticed.
Okay, let's just start.
275.109
274.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
275.276
Okay, the first question
is on the topic of optics.
277.736
277.903
"What is the shortest light pulse
ever produced?"
280.155
281.532
Dr. Cooper.
283.221
# SHELDON
283.221
Of course, the answer is 130 attoseconds.
284.910
# PENNY
285.077
That is correct.
286.099
# LEONARD
286.099
I knew that too.
287.121
287.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
287.997
Good for you, sweetie.
Okay, next question.
290.666
290.833
"What is the quantum-mechanical effect
used to encode data on hard-disk drives?"
294.545
295.921
Howard?
297.548
# SHELDON
297.548
The answer is giant magnetoresistance.
299.174
# PENNY
299.341
Right.
300.384
# HOWARD
300.384
Hey, I buzzed in.
301.427
# SHELDON
301.594
And I answered. It's called teamwork.
304.138
304.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
305.806
Don't you think I should answer
engineering questions? I am an engineer.
309.393
# SHELDON
309.852
By that logic, I should answer anthropology
questions because I'm a mammal.
314.398
314.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
316.734
Just ask another one.
318.193
# PENNY
318.360
Okay.
319.486
319.653
"What artificial satellite has seen glimpses
of Einstein's predicted 'frame dragging'?"
323.991
# SHELDON
325.367
And, of course, it's Gravity Probe B.
327.494
327.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
327.661
Sheldon, you have to let
somebody else answer.
330.414
# SHELDON
330.581
Why?
331.728
# PENNY
331.728
Because it's polite.
332.875
# SHELDON
333.250
What do manners have to do with it?
This is war.
336.837
337.100
**LOL**
337.504
Were the Romans polite
when they salted Carthage...
339.924
340.090
...to make sure
nothing would ever grow again?
342.551
342.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
343.177
Leonard, you said
I only had to ask questions.
346.388
346.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
348.098
The objective is to give correct answers.
350.351
350.517
If I know them,
why shouldn't I give them?
352.478
# HOWARD
352.686
Some of us might have
the correct answers too.
355.397
# SHELDON
355.564
Please. You don't even have a Ph.D.
356.941
# HOWARD
356.941
All right, that's it.
358.317
# LEONARD
358.484
Howard, sit down.
359.631
# HOWARD
359.631
Okay.
360.778
360.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
362.154
We should take a little break.
363.697
# SHELDON
363.697
Good idea. I need my wrist brace.
365.240
365.407
All this button pushing is aggravating
my old Nintendo injury.
368.702
369.000
**LOL**
370.079
I agree.
371.121
# PENNY
371.288
What did he say?
372.331
# HOWARD
372.748
He compared Sheldon to a disposable
feminine cleansing product...
377.461
377.628
...one might use on a summer's eve.
380.255
380.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
382.383
Yeah, and the bag it came in.
385.052
386.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
388.931
Leonard, excellent.
I wanna show you something.
391.100
# LEONARD
391.266
Can it wait? I need to talk to you.
393.143
# SHELDON
393.310
Just look. I've designed
the perfect uniforms for our team.
396.438
396.605
The colors are based
on Star
397.898
397.898
The Original Series.
399.191
399.358
The three of you will wear support red
and I will wear command gold.
403.612
403.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
404.530
Why do they say
406.031
# SHELDON
406.615
Army Ants.
407.741
# LEONARD
409.076
Isn't that confusing? AA might mean
something else to certain people.
412.913
# SHELDON
413.872
Why would a Physics Bowl team
be called Anodized Aluminum?
417.668
417.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
418.002
No, I meant
419.044
420.379
Never mind.
422.006
421.700
**LOL**
422.172
Hey, check it out.
423.882
424.049
I got you a Batman cookie jar.
427.177
# SHELDON
427.344
Oh, neat. What's the occasion?
430.431
# LEONARD
430.597
Well, you're a friend
and you like Batman and cookies...
433.726
433.892
...and you're off the team.
435.394
436.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
438.897
What?
440.107
# LEONARD
440.274
Howard, Raj and I
just had a team meeting.
442.609
# SHELDON
442.776
You didn't.
443.861
# LEONARD
443.861
We did. I just came from there.
444.945
# SHELDON
445.112
I don't know where you just came from.
It couldn't have been a team meeting.
448.615
448.782
I'm on the team and I wasn't there.
Ergo, the team did not meet.
452.703
452.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
453.287
Okay, let me try it this way.
455.998
456.165
I was at a coffee klatch
with a couple of friends...
458.917
459.084
...and one thing led to another
and, it turns out, you're off the team.
462.796
462.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
463.797
Why?
465.361
# LEONARD
465.361
Because you're taking all the fun out of it.
466.925
# SHELDON
467.092
I'm sorry, is the winner of the Physics
Bowl the team that has the most fun?
471.055
# LEONARD
471.221
Okay. Let me try it this way.
472.848
473.015
You're annoying and no one wants
to play with you anymore.
476.727
476.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
478.479
I see.
480.147
480.314
Well, at this point I should inform you
that I intend to form my own team...
486.487
486.653
...and destroy the molecular bonds
that bind your very matter together...
490.032
490.199
...and reduce the resulting
particulate chaos to tears.
494.328
493.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
496.038
Thanks for the heads up.
497.790
# SHELDON
498.499
You're welcome.
500.209
501.293
One more thing.
501.981
# LEONARD
501.981
Yes?
502.669
# SHELDON
502.836
It's on, bitch.
504.880
504.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
513.806
So who did he get to be on his team?
515.349
# LEONARD
515.349
He won't say.
516.892
517.059
He just smiles
and eats macaroons out of his Bat-Jar.
520.896
520.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
521.730
He's using psychological warfare.
We must reply in kind.
525.526
525.692
I say we wait until he looks at us,
then laugh
528.362
529.000
**LOL**
528.529
"Yes, you are a smart
and strong competitor.
530.864
531.031
But we are also smart and strong...
532.699
532.866
...and we have a reasonable chance
of defeating you."
536.286
535.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
537.746
How exactly would that laugh go?
539.706
# RAJ
541.458
Hee-hee-hee!
544.378
543.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
544.837
That sounds more
545.879
546.046
"We are a tall, thin woman who wants
to make a coat out of your dalmatians."
551.552
550.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
552.678
Guys, let's remember that Sheldon
is still our friend and my roommate.
556.265
# HOWARD
556.431
So?
557.474
# LEONARD
558.100
So nothing. Let's destroy him.
560.144
560.700
**LOL**
561.353
Gentlemen.

# RAJ
563.105
Hee-hee-hee!
565.440

**LOL**
# HOWARD
570.487
Okay, we're gonna need a strong fourth
for our team.
573.073
# RAJ
573.240
You know who is apparently very smart
is the girl who played TV's Blossom.
577.035
578.200
**LOL**
578.537
She got a Ph.D. in neuroscience
or something.
580.956

581.123
Raj, we're not getting TV's Blossom
to join our Physics Bowl team.
585.252

How about the girl from
The Wonder Years?

**LOL**
# HOWARD
590.966
Gentlemen, I believe I've found
the solution to all our problems.
594.720
# LEONARD
597.097
We can't ask Leslie Winkle.
598.807
# RAJ
598.974
Why? Because you slept together...
600.601
600.767
...and when she was done with you, she
discarded you like last night's chutney?
604.563
604.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
608.275
Yes.
609.776
609.500

610.527
You gotta take one for the team.
612.508

612.508
Yeah. Sack up, dude.

614.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
615.908
Fine.
617.492
618.493
Here I go, taking one for the team...
621.079
621.246
...in the sack.

Ahem. So, Leslie,
I have a question for you...
630.339
629.000
**LOL**
630.505
