WOMAN :
Did you say, "Call Helen Boxleitner"?

**LOL**
# HOWARD
13.431
No. Call Leonard Hofstadter.

Oh. It's very impressive.
41.208

If we're through playing
Mock the Flawed Technology...
47.173
47.340
...can we get on with "Halo" night?
48.883
49.050
We were supposed to start at 8.
It's now 8:06.
51.135
51.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
51.302
So we'll start now.
52.720
# SHELDON
52.887
We have to decide
if those lost six minutes...
54.972
55.139
...will come out of game time,
bathroom time or the pizza break.
58.059
58.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
58.225
We could split it two, two and two.
60.019

If we're having anchovies on the pizza,
we can't take it out of bathroom time.

81.499
# PENNY
81.666
Well, there's this girl I know
from back in Nebraska, Christy.
84.543
84.710
She called me up,
she's like, "Hey, how's California?"
87.254
87.421
And I'm like, "Awesome,"
because it's not Nebraska.
89.757
89.800
**LOL**
89.924
The next thing I know,
she's invited herself to stay with me.

She got here today
and she's just been in my apartment...
99.058
99.225
...yakking about every guy she slept with
in Omaha, which is every guy in Omaha...
103.312
103.900
**LOL**
103.479
...and washing
the sluttiest collection of underwear...
106.023
106.190
...you have ever seen
in my bathroom sink.
108.109
# HOWARD
108.275
Is she doing it one thong at a time
or does she throw it all in?
111.529
111.696
Like some sort of erotic bouillabaisse?

**LOL**
120.079
So if you don't like this Christy,
why are you letting her stay?
122.998
# PENNY
123.165
She was engaged to my cousin
while sleeping with my brother...
126.043
126.210
...so she's kind of family.
127.503
128.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
128.963
Yeah, I apologize for my earlier outburst.
131.298
131.465
Who needs "Halo"
when we can be regaled...
133.342
133.509
...with the delightfully folksy tale
of the whore of Omaha?

# LEONARD
137.596
Oh... I don't think she's a whore.

No, yeah, she's definitely a whore.
141.350
142.000
**LOL**
141.517
I mean, she has absolutely no standards.
143.936
144.103
This one time, she was at...
146.355
146.522
Where's Howard?
147.690
147.857
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
149.108
149.275
I understand you're new in town.
151.068

152.611
Oh, good grief.
153.904
182.300

Ugh. I cannot believe Christy let Howard
into my apartment.
188.689
188.200

# SHELDON
189.064
And I cannot believe people pay
for horoscopes...
191.358
191.800
**LOL**
191.525
...but on a more serious note, it's 8:13
and we're still not playing "Halo."
195.863
195.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
196.030
Okay, fine. We'll just play one-on-one
until he gets back.
198.908
# SHELDON
199.074
One-on-one? We don't play one-on-one.
200.826
200.993
We play teams, not one-on-one.
One-on-one.
204.789
204.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
205.247
Well, the only way we can play teams
at this point is if we cut Raj in half.
209.418

# RAJ
209.710
Sure, cut the foreigner in half.
There's a billion more where he came from.

The wheel was a great idea.
Relativity was a great idea.

This is a complex battle simulation
with a steep learning curve.

There are myriad weapons,
vehicles and strategies to master...
239.573
239.740
...not to mention an intricate back-story.
241.575

Okay, it's not good sportsmanship
to shoot somebody who's just re-spawned.

Okay, that's it.
I don't know how, but she is cheating.

he's also a rather unpleasant winner.

From what I heard, they're either having sex

Do you mind if I stay here tonight?

So?
404.029
# SHELDON
404.196
So if there's an earthquake
and the three of us are trapped here...
407.449
407.616
...we could be out of food
by tomorrow afternoon.
410.619
411.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
411.370
Are you suggesting
that if we let Penny stay...
413.497
413.664
...we might succumb to cannibalism?
415.791
# SHELDON
415.958
No one ever thinks it'll happen
until it does.
418.836

off our bones while we sleep, you can stay.

427.845
He's engaging in reductio ad absurdum.
430.264
429.800
**LOL**
431.098
It's the fallacy of extending someone's
argument to ridiculous proportions...
434.685
434.852
...and then criticizing the result.
And I don't appreciate it.
437.938

I'll get you a blanket and a pillow.

I use the bathroom from 7 to 7:20.

It's culturally universal.
472.347

A bed, even a temporary bed...
474.308
474.475
...is always oriented with the headboard
away from the door.
477.227

It serves the ancient imperative
of protecting oneself against marauders.

# HOWARD
673.736
In the shower.
674.967
675.217
By the way,
where did you get that loofah mitt?
677.469
677.636
Yours reaches places
that mine just won't.
680.222
680.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
684.393
You used my loofah?
686.603
# HOWARD
686.770
More precisely, we used your loofah.
689.189
689.356
I exfoliated her brains out.
691.984
692.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
694.152
You can keep that too.
696.071
# HOWARD
696.530
Ah. Well, then, we'll probably need to talk
about your stuffed-bear collection.
700.742
701.100

CHRISTY: Howard?
703.245
# HOWARD
703.245
In here, milady.
704.329

Mm. There's my little engine that could.

I'm Sheldon.

721.221
Right. You're Howard's entourage.
723.432
725.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
725.934
So, Christy, what are your plans?
727.853
# CHRISTIE
728.020
Well, Howard said he'd take me shopping
in Beverly Hills.
731.440
# PENNY
731.606
Yeah, no, I meant plans to find
someplace to live other than with me.
735.319
735.485
Not that I don't love having you,
but it's a little crowded.
738.447
# LEONARD
738.613
Penny, you're always welcome
to stay with us.
740.699
# SHELDON
740.866
Oh, terrific.
Now we're running a cute little B & B.
743.910
743.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
744.703
Let me offer a little thinking here.
746.538
746.705
Why doesn't Christy stay with me?
748.269
# LEONARD
748.269
You live with your mother.
749.833
# HOWARD
750.000
I do not. My mother lives with me.
752.669
753.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
753.670
It's settled. Christy will stay with Howard,
Penny can go back to her apartment.
757.382
757.549
And I'll watch the last 24 minutes
of Doctor Who...
759.968
760.135
...although at this point,
it's more like Doctor Why Bother?
763.221
763.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
764.348
Sheldon, you just can't dictate--
766.141
# SHELDON
766.141
No more talking. Everybody go.
767.934
768.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
768.935
So, what do you say?
Wanna repair to Casa Wolowitz?
772.522
# CHRISTIE
772.689
What is that, like a Mexican deli?
775.233
# HOWARD
775.400
I'm sorry,
I should have mentioned this earlier.
777.611
777.778
My last name is Wolowitz.
779.488
# CHRISTIE
779.654
Oh. That's so cool.
782.240
782.407
My first Jew.
784.785

**LOL**
# SHELDON
787.913
I imagine there aren't
very many kosher cornhuskers.
791.333
792.000
**LOL**
# CHRISTIE
793.668
But you're still taking me shopping?
795.024
# HOWARD
795.024
Anything you want.
796.380
# CHRISTIE
796.546
Okay, I'll go pack my stuff.
798.882
# HOWARD
801.468
When they perfect human cloning,
I'm gonna order 12 of those.
805.013
804.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
807.057
Howard, can't you see she's using you?
808.850
# HOWARD
809.017
Who cares? Last night,
she pulled off her blouse and I wept.
812.312
812.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
812.479
Look, Howard, I know her, okay?
814.147
814.314
She'll have sex with anyone
as long as they keep buying her things.
817.734
# HOWARD
818.151
Really?
818.881
# PENNY
818.881
Yeah.
819.611
# HOWARD
819.778
YaY
821.154
821.200
**LOL**
823.698
If you'll excuse me,
I have some bar mitzvah bonds to cash.
828.245
827.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
836.002
I'm sorry,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
838.922
# LEONARD
839.089
We can't order Chinese food
without Wolowitz?
842.008
842.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
842.175
Let me walk you through it.
843.468
843.635
Our standard order is,
the steamed dumpling appetizer...
846.346
846.513
...General Tso's chicken,
beef with broccoli...
848.640
848.807
...shrimp with lobster sauce,
and vegetable lo mein.
851.184
851.351
Do you see the problem?
853.270
853.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
854.729
I see a problem.
856.690
# SHELDON
856.857
Our entire order is predicated
on four dumplings and four entrees...
860.485
860.652
...divided amongst four people.
863.155
864.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
864.990
So we'll just order three entrees.
867.159
# SHELDON
867.325
Fine. What do you wanna eliminate?
868.910
869.077
And who gets the extra dumpling?
870.537
871.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
870.537
We could cut it into thirds.
871.997
# SHELDON
872.164
Then it's no longer a dumpling.
873.623
873.790
Once you out it open, it is, at best,
a very small open-faced sandwich.
877.586
876.800
**LOL**
# WAITER
878.044
Hi, fellas.
879.337
879.504
Oh. Where's your annoying little friend
who thinks he speaks Mandarin?
884.134
883.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
884.301
He's putting his needs
ahead of the collective good.
886.720
886.887
Where he comes from,
that's punishable by death.
889.264
# WAITER
889.890
I come from Sacramento.
892.642
894.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
896.062
Can we get an order of dumplings,
but with three instead of four?
898.982
# WAITER
899.149
No substitutions.
900.692
# LEONARD
900.859
This isn't a substitution.
It's a reduction.
903.236
# WAITER
903.403
Okay. No reductions.
905.822
905.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
906.573
Fine. Bring us three orders of dumplings.
909.075
909.242
That's 12, we'll each have four.
910.472
# RAJ
910.472
That works.
911.703
# SHELDON
911.870
If we fill up on dumplings,
we need to eliminate an entree.
914.372
# WAITER
914.539
No eliminations.
915.749
916.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
917.167
If we have extra,
we'll just take the leftovers home.
919.586
# SHELDON
919.753
And divide it how? I'm telling you,
we cannot do this without Wolowitz.
923.381
923.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
923.548
Wolowitz is with his girlfriend.
925.008
925.175
If you'd let me invite Penny,
you would've had your fourth.
927.761
# SHELDON
927.928
Have you seen Penny eat Chinese food?
929.638
929.804
She uses a fork
and she double-dips her egg rolls.
932.098
932.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
932.599
We don't order egg rolls.
934.288
# SHELDON
934.288
Exactly. But we'd have to if she was here.
935.977
936.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
936.144
Can we please make a decision?
937.604
937.771
Not only are there children starving in
India, there's an Indian starving right here.
942.192
941.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
943.652
There's an idea.
Why don't we go out for Indian food?
945.779
# SHELDON
945.946
Oh, ew.
947.697
947.200

You're nice boys.
949.616
# WAITER
949.783
Tell you what I'm going to do.
I'm gonna bring you the four dumplings.
953.078
953.245
When I'm walking over to the table...
954.955
955.121
...maybe I get bumped,
one of the dumplings fall to the floor.
957.999
958.166
No one has to know.
959.209
# SHELDON
961.044
I'll know.
962.170

Yeah, we can always divide soup.

What about the won tons?

Yeah? Okay.
984.734
986.486
So?

# LEONARD
988.446
With Wolowitz spending all of his time
with your friend Christy
991.449
# PENNY
991.616
She's not my friend. Friends do not
get their friends' Care Bears all sweaty.
995.620
995.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
996.621
Right, anyway, uh,
with Wolowitz occupied elsewhere...
1000.417
1000.584
...we had something
we wanted to ask you.
1003.003
1003.169
Sheldon?

# SHELDON
1004.129
Yes. Ahem.
1005.088
1006.700
**LOL**
1007.882
Penny,
we would very much appreciate it...
1010.885
1011.052
...if you would be the fourth member
of our "Halo" team.
1013.680
1014.639
I don't think I need to tell you
what an honor this is.
1018.518

**LOL**
# PENNY
1020.729
Oh. That's so sweet.
1022.105
1022.272
But I'm going out dancing
with a girlfriend.
1024.316
# SHELDON
1024.482
You can't go out, it's "Halo" night.
1026.776

# PENNY
1027.152
Well, for Penny, it's dancing night.
1029.321
# SHELDON
1029.487
You go dancing every Wednesday?
1030.468
# PENNY
1030.468
No.
1031.448
# SHELDON
1031.615
Then it's not dancing night.
1032.907
1033.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
1034.826
Why don't I play with you tomorrow?
1036.411

All right, now, Sheldon,
you and I are about to have a problem.

# LEONARD
1046.379
Sheldon, remember, we role-played this.
1048.506
# SHELDON
1048.673
Yes, but you didn't portray her
as completely irrational.
1051.426
1051.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
1051.926
All right, fellas, I gotta go.
1053.887
1054.054
But good luck.
1056.139
# LEONARD
1058.850
Maybe we should've asked if we could go
dancing with her and her girlfriend.
1062.520
# SHELDON
1062.687
Okay, assuming we could dance,
which we can't...
1064.898
1065.065
...there are three of us and two of them.
1066.941
# LEONARD
1067.108
So?

1069.256
It's the Chinese restaurant all over again.
1071.404
1070.500
**LOL**
1071.571
I assure you that cutting
a dumpling in thirds is child's play...
1074.574
1074.741
...compared with three men each attempting
to dance with 67 percent of a woman.
1078.995
1078.900

For God's sakes, Sheldon,

to choose between sex and "Halo."

No, I'm going to ask him
to choose between sex and "Halo 3."

As far as I know,
sex has not been upgraded...
