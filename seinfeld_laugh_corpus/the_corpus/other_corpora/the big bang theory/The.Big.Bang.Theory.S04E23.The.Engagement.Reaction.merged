You mean, the one with my 118-pound
rock-hard stud of a fiancֳ©...
10.845

**LOL**
11.012
...who's prone to canker sores
and pinkeye?
14.307

**LOL**
# PENNY
14.473
I prefer to look at it
as the one with my ex-boyfriend...
17.226
17.393
...and his gorgeous, successful girlfriend
who makes me feel like a toothless Okie.
22.440

Do you want me
to spill hot soup on her?

Please, you're not that kind of person.

# BERNADETTE
29.697
I know.

But if she orders something low-fat,
I'll totally give her the full-fat version.

The backwash into this glass...

...is every pathogen that
calls your mouth "home sweet home."
61.187

I'd like a seven-day course
of penicillin...
79.497

Nothing soothes those

What'd your mother say
when you told her?

He hasn't told her yet.
He's waiting for the right time.

you've got to tell your mother.

Have you told your parents you're dating
this short glass of skimmed milk yet?
171.881
171.200
**LOL**
# PRIYA
174.091
That's different.
First of all, we're not engaged...
176.927
177.094
...and second, Indian parents
are very protective of their children.
180.848
# HOWARD
181.015
Right. Whereas Jewish mothers take
a casual la-di-da approach to their sons.
186.187

It's not a big deal. It's just ever since

Just the ones that will kill me.

I'll tell Howard you're more concerned

# SHELDON
535.702
Fine, I'll go.
536.954
538.205
Just for the record,
my Aunt Ruth died in a hospital.
541.875
542.042
She went in to visit my uncle Roger,
caught something...
545.212

you picked up your mother?

I'm saying it'd be easier to lift a car.

What can I tell you,
after I found the courage...
588.422
588.589
...to put her pants back on,
I was unstoppable.
591.550
591.000
**LOL**

So how is she?
594.970
# HOWARD
594.970
They're running tests, I don't know.

596.680
It may have been a heart attack
or heart-attack-like event.
600.350
# PENNY
600.517
What's the difference?
601.789
# SHELDON
601.789
A heart-attack-like event...
603.061
603.228
...is an event that's like a heart attack.

Regardless, coronary problems
are eminently treatable.
611.904
612.070
What's more likely
to kill Howard's mother...
614.239
614.448
...are the antibiotic-resistant
superbugs...
616.491
616.658
...festering in every nook and cranny
of this hospital.

So it's probably genetic.
648.544
# HOWARD

What you've gotta keep in mind

...I've been the whole world

684.309

I mean, she'd be threatened by any
woman who can give me what she can't.

What happened?
699.950
# BERNADETTE
699.950
Howard's mother had a heart attack...
701.285
701.451
...because I have sex with him
and she can't.

Bernie, wait.
710.836

It's just so weird.
Howard Wolowitz is my friend.
730.397
730.564
You know he tried to stick his tongue
down my throat and I broke his nose?
734.318
734.200
**LOL**
# PRIYA
735.152
That's a little easier to believe
than he's your friend.
738.071
# PENNY
738.238
Yeah, tell me about it.
740.073
# PRIYA
740.240
My brother had a group of friends
like this in India.
742.743
742.909
They dressed up in leotards
and goggles.
744.786
744.953
And called themselves
the New Delhi Power Rangers.
747.331

**LOL**
# PENNY

You mean, when he was little.

Not as little as you'd want him to be.

This stuff is horrible.
Wanna see if we can find real coffee?

777.903
# RAJ
777.903
One broke up with you.

Do you really want her
telling the other one why?

# RAJ

You'd think it'd be
because my parents didn't love me...

they loved me a great deal.

# BERNADETTE
808.830
How can we be together...
810.143
810.310
...if the thought of us getting married
might kill your mother?

# HOWARD
814.147
It's the circle of life, sweetie.

866.909
It wasn't a heart attack.
867.951

She's awake, she's resting comfortably
and we're still running tests.
871.496
# HOWARD
871.705
Can I see her?
872.581
# DOCTOR
872.581
Actually, she said...
873.457
873.623

"the little Catholic girl first."

Every once in a while,
before we'd go to bed...
