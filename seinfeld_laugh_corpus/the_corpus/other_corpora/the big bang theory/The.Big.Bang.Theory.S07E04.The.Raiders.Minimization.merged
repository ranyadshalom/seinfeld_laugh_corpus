# AMY

It was good.
13.102
# SHELDON

That's it? "Good"?
16.147
# AMY
16.314
I enjoyed it.
17.941
18.107
When you told me I was going to be
"losing my virginity,"
20.347
20.443
I didn't think you meant showing me
Raiders of the Lost Ark
22.654
23.100
**LOL**
22.737
for the first time.
23.780
# SHELDON
24.781
My apologies.
I chose my words poorly.
27.700
27.867
I should have said
29.118
29.285
you were about to have
your world rocked on my couch.
31.663

It's one of my all-time favorites.

It was very entertaining,
40.505
40.672
despite the glaring story problem.

# SHELDON

Story problem?

Raiders of the Lost Ark is
the love child
56.020
56.187
of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas,
58.147
58.314
two of the most gifted filmmakers
of our generation.
60.775
60.942
I've watched it 36 times,
63.444
63.611
except for the snake scene
and the face-melting scene,
66.447
66.614
which I can only watch
when it's still light out, but...
69.993
69.800
**LOL**
70.159
I defy you to find a story problem.

# AMY

All right.
78.668
78.835
Indiana Jones plays no role
in the outcome of the story.
82.213
82.380
If he weren't in the film,
it would turn out exactly the same.
86.509
# SHELDON
86.676
Oh, I see your confusion.
You don't understand.
90.138
90.305
Indiana Jones was the one in the hat
with the whip.
93.975
94.200
**LOL**
# AMY
94.934
No, I do,
and if he weren't in the movie,
97.979
98.146
the Nazis would have still found
the ark,
100.023
100.189
taken it to the island,
opened it up and all died,
103.067
103.234
just like they did.

# LEONARD
144.525
Yeah, but Sheldon and Amy
were having date night
146.736
146.903
and they don't need me there
to make it awkward.

177.000
**LOL**
179.394
Come on. Not that book.
181.938

It's got, like, every horrible story

How bad could it be?

# LEONARD
195.993
There's chapters
about potty training,
198.121
198.287
and bed-wetting and...
200.998

**LOL**
201.165
masturbation.
202.917

Basically, if something came
out of me, she wrote about it!

208.400

209.632
You know what?
Do whatever you want,
211.676
211.801
just don't talk to me about it.
213.219
# PENNY
213.386
Not even the chapter
on the breast-feeding crisis?
216.389
216.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
221.811
It was not a crisis.
224.313
224.700
**LOL**
224.897
Apparently, I favored the left one.
She got a little lopsided.

258.723
Amy ruined
Raiders of the Lost Ark for me,
261.434
261.684
so now I'm trying to find something
beloved to her and ruin that.
265.480
265.400

Because her life wasn't enough?

Raiders? It's perfect.
276.240

# SHELDON
276.365
Yeah, except for the fact
277.658
277.825
that Indiana Jones is completely
irrelevant to the story.
280.369
280.495
With or without him, the Nazis find
the ark, open it, and die.

Hey, wait a minute. No, the Nazis
were digging in the wrong place.
296.594

The only reason they got the ark
was because Indy found it first.
299.305
# LEONARD
299.388
Actually, they were only digging
in the wrong place
301.057
301.140
because Indy had the medallion.
302.380
302.475
Without him, they would have had
the medallion and dug in the right place.

Okay, I know you don't
want to talk about it,

about your mom's book?
319.575
320.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
319.784
No.
320.847
# PENNY
320.847
I just want to know
321.911
322.078
why a five-year-old boy puts
on his mom's makeup
324.247
324.413
and wears balloon boobies.
326.374
326.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
329.335
They weren't boobies.
They were muscles.
331.671
332.400
**LOL**
332.547
And the makeup was green.
I was pretending to be the Hulk.
335.758
336.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
336.551
You were wearing her bra.
337.969
# LEONARD
338.052
That was to keep my muscles
from sagging!

Can we please stop talking
about this?!

# PENNY

Okay, okay. But you know,
as a student of psychology
345.434
345.643
who got a check-plus on her
first homework assignment...
348.646
348.600
**LOL**
349.730
I think, sometimes, it's good
to open up about these things.
352.775
# LEONARD
352.942
Okay, fine. Do you want to know
why I dressed like the Hulk?
356.112
356.237
Because I was always mad at my mom
357.905
358.030
and I wanted to smash
my way out of that house.
359.949
# PENNY
360.408
Well, why were you so angry?
361.847
# LEONARD
361.847
Gee, I don't know.
363.286
363.619
Maybe it's because I was always
the subject of her little experiments.
366.622
366.998
Did you get to the chapter
where she staged the Easter egg hunt
369.625
369.834
with no eggs to see how long
I'd keep looking?
372.628
372.500

the first thing they see is
your picture.
412.892
413.210
I just want to make sure
you look fun and full of life
415.463
415.630
and not like a body
they just pulled out of the river.

431.812

But when you do, imagine the camera
is the girl you want to meet.

doesn't want to hurt you.

I put "unobjectionable."

it just seems like I'm being cocky.

Why do they keep him?!

you don't want to.

It's like, "It's too loud,"

Penny will do anything
to make me feel better.

I'm not proud of it,
but it does work.
724.939
725.600

725.064
I got her to watch a six-part
documentary on Monty Python.
729.193

Well, the last time you made
an unscheduled video chat,
746.669
746.752
there was a curly fry
in your regular fries

You were kind enough to watch
Raiders of the Lost Ark with me.
770.484
770.567
So I'd like to return the favor
by inviting you to watch an episode
774.822
775.400
**LOL**
774.905
of your favorite childhood
television series,
777.908

Yeah. I guess I was just thinking
about my mom,
817.489
817.531
and how sad my childhood was.
820.451
820.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
822.536
Yeah, I bet it sucked.

I'm gonna take a bath.
You do the dishes.

Here's what's gonna
832.212
832.254
I'm gonna take a bath,

I shouldn't have done it.
And it's making me feel sad.

871.794
So sad.

What...? Another one.
934.940

You know, it's weird.
937.401

When they're reading your profile,
does it make you feel exposed?
940.362
940.446
Like they see you naked?
942.281
943.200

I love Little House.
951.206

It made me want to live
on a farm so much
953.208
953.292
I tried to milk my cat.
954.877
955.300

That tangy bowl of Cheerios
was not worth the stitches.

I read they were illegally squatting
on Indian land.

Personally, I think what we did
to the Native Americans was wrong,

but this is your favorite show,
not mine.

Oh, look at little Laura Ingalls,
eating that peanut butter sandwich.
993.540

Peanut butter?
995.000
995.167
Huh...
996.460
997.000
**LOL**
997.669
That's strange,
999.463
999.546
since peanut butter wasn't introduced
until the early 1900s.
1003.008
1003.800

1005.552
If I knew this show was
about time travel,

I would have watched it much sooner.

You're trying to get back at me
1014.811

for what I said
about Raiders of the Lost Ark.
1016.564
# SHELDON
1016.647
That's silly.
1018.398
1018.524
Almost as silly as Dr. Baker
having a telephone,
1021.109
1021.193
since telephones only existed
in large cities at that time.
1024.279
1024.863

on the Preposterous.

Sheldon, we're in a relationship.

When you get angry, just tell me.

You don't need to seek revenge.

Every time my dad stayed out
all night,
1041.421
1041.463
my mom would put hamster poop
in his chewing tobacco.
1044.091
1044.300

Well, that's not how
we're going to do it.

Fine.
1050.264
1050.347
I'm mad at you.
1051.848
1051.932
Not only did you ruin Raiders for me,
1054.309
1054.351
you may have ruined
the whole franchise.
1056.186
1056.270
Except for the fourth one,
1058.105
1058.146
which was bad
before you got your mitts on it.
1060.274
1060.600

I shouldn't have said it.
I'm sorry.

Do you feel better?
1067.677
# SHELDON
1067.677
Yes.
1068.907
1069.408
But not as good as I'm going
to when I tell you
1071.243
1071.326
that your precious Garfield has
no reason to hate Mondays.
