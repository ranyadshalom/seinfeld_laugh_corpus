Oh, hey, if you guys are free
this weekend,
5.398
5.553
I won a night of wine tasting from work.
7.180
# LEONARD
7.597
That sounds fun.
8.181
# PENNY
8.181
Mmm-hmm.
8.765
# LEONARD
8.932
Like, how come scientists
don't win free stuff like sales people do?
12.143
# HOWARD
12.310
'Cause we're not in it for the stuff.
 We're in it for the groupies.
15.438
16.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
17.941
Personally, I find the notion
of external rewards demeaning.
20.693
20.860
I pursue science
for the intrinsic joy of discovery.
23.947
# AMY
24.614
But you always say
that you wanna win a Nobel Prize.
26.950
# SHELDON
27.867
I also say, "Don't contradict me
in front of my friends,"
29.578
29.661
but that you don't remember.
30.781
31.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
32.288
All right. Well, let me know
if you guys wanna go.
33.748
# RAJ
33.831
I would love to.
34.832
34.999
I do enjoy the complexity
of an aged Pinot Noir.
37.961
# LEONARD
38.127
I'm sure that would pair nicely
with your five nuggets of chicken.
41.047
41.600
**LOL**
# AMY
43.091
Well, it sounds like a nice night.
We should go.
45.093
# SHELDON
45.260
Wine again? Yeah, no, thank you.
47.387
47.554
I like my grapes the old-fashioned way,
in a juice box.
50.473
50.800
**LOL**
# AMY
51.933
Well, I'm going.
52.976
53.142
You couldn't stop me
from getting a massage at the mall,
55.061
55.144
and you're not stopping me now.
56.479
# SHELDON
56.813
I shouldn't have to see my girlfriend
get groped in public by another man.
60.316
61.000
**LOL**
# AMY
61.568
And I shouldn't have to see
62.648
62.735
my boyfriend riding on a train
for children, around the mall.
65.321
65.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
67.323
The little choo-choo for toddlers?
68.992
# AMY
69.158
And now you know why I needed the massage.
70.994
71.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
72.537
Well, we're out.
73.538
73.705
Bernie can't drink, 'cause she's pregnant.
75.707
75.873
And she's pregnant because we had sex,
and we had sex because, well...
80.086
80.253
Come on.
81.254
82.300
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
83.506
It's okay, you should go.
84.966
# HOWARD
85.216
You sure?
85.967
# BERNADETTE
85.967
Of course.
86.718
# PENNY
86.884
Yeah, give her a break from...
88.803
88.970
Well, come on.
90.305
90.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
92.432
Well, Bernadette, looks like
Saturday night, it's you and me.
94.832
# BERNADETTE
95.226
Me? HOW? Why?
96.436
97.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
98.104
Well, it makes perfect sense.
99.264
99.397
Look, because you're an expectant mother,
you can't drink alcohol, I don't like to.
102.900
103.067
You can't have sushi, and I don't like to.
105.236
105.403
You can't go in hot tubs.
106.904
107.071
I consider them
vats of sweaty-people soup.
109.699
110.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
111.701
Gee, Sheldon, I don't know.
113.036
# SHELDON
113.202
Oh, come on. Well, roller coasters,
caffeine, runny eggs.
116.873
117.040
I've been avoiding these things
all my life.
118.760
118.916
And now, because you're pregnant,
you have to.
120.877
121.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
122.170
The difference is,
she's bringing life into the world,
124.290
124.380
and you sucked it out.
125.381
125.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
127.759
I guess we could give it a try.
128.999
# SHELDON
129.594
Well, little lady,
you've heard of party hardy.
131.638
131.804
Get ready to party hardly.
133.389
133.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
135.725
I bet you'd like a drink right now.
137.185
137.800
**LOL**
166.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
166.714
Hey, you think it'd be okay
if I brought Claire to the wine tasting?
169.134
# LEONARD
169.217
Sure, I'd like to meet her.
170.301
# RAJ
170.468
Oh, that's great. I've been wanting
her to meet you guys, too.
172.387
172.470
So, this seems
like the perfect opportunity.
174.190
# SHELDON
174.597
But I won't be there.
175.640
# RAJ
175.807
Funny how that worked out.
176.891
178.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
179.435
Does this mean
Emily's not in the picture anymore?
181.062
# RAJ
181.145
No, I'm still dating her.
182.188
# LEONARD
182.647
Okay, help me out.
183.731
183.898
How are you doing this?
Do they know about each other?
186.401
# RAJ
186.567
They know that we're not exclusive,
and we just don't ask too many questions.
190.321
# SHELDON
190.488
You know what, it's like how I play
Warlords of Ka 'a with you,
193.116
193.282
and Elder Sign with Frank and Alicia.
195.910
197.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
198.246
Who's Frank and Alicia?
199.372
# SHELDON
200.289
You and I spend a lot of time together.
Can there be a little mystery between us?
204.252
204.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
206.212
Okay, everything's hooked up, we're ready.
208.292
# SHELDON
208.464
I am going to record this for posterity.
210.717
# LEONARD
210.883
All right, here goes nothing.
212.510
# SHELDON
212.844
"Here goes nothing"?
213.928
214.095
This is the initial test
for our prototype.
215.775
215.930
Can we give it a little more gravitas?
217.139
# LEONARD
217.139
Fine.
218.349
218.400
**LOL**
218.975
Preliminary trial
219.976
220.143
of the infinite persistence
gyroscopic navigational system,
222.770
222.937
phase one, commencing.
224.147
# SHELDON
224.647
Uh... Maybe it's your voice.
225.857
226.023
I'm gonna see if I can get
James Earl Jones to do it in post.
228.423
228.600
**LOL**
236.659
Ah...
237.660
# RAJ
238.286
It's... It's beautiful.
240.747
# HOWARD
243.082
Actually, it's making me dizzy.
244.834
# LEONARD
245.501
Good, it's not just me.
246.861
249.300
**LOL**
253.551
CLAIRE: Hello.
254.281
# RAJ
254.281
Hey, Claire.
255.011
# CLAIRE
255.261
Hey, what's up?
256.762
# RAJ
256.762
Hi, yeah, um, I was wondering
258.264
258.431
if you're free Saturday night.
260.558
260.850
All my friends
are going to a wine tasting.
262.727
# CLAIRE
263.352
Sure.
264.437
264.604
I guess. If you don't think
meeting your friends is too big a step.
267.774
# RAJ
268.483
Why would it be too big a step?
270.359
# CLAIRE
270.818
I don't know,
I just don't want things to get weird.
273.321
# RAJ
274.489
Nothing to worry about.
276.449
276.657
People meet people all the time,
and it isn't weird.
279.243
279.619
I met Bon Jovi once,
280.661
280.828
which you'd think might be weird.
Turns out, total sweetheart.
283.581
284.600
**LOL**
# CLAIRE
285.792
Okay, but you and I
have been keeping things casual.
289.462
289.629
Will you introduce me as your friend
or as your girlfriend?
292.340
293.049
What if I like them
and they don't like me?
295.009
295.176
What if they like me
and I don't like them?
297.178
# RAJ
298.095
Boy, it wasn't this hard with Bon Jovi.
300.181
300.348
I said, "You rock!"
He said, "Thanks, man." And that was that.
303.100
304.500

309.000

# PENNY
312.568
Hey, you ready to go?
313.465
# LEONARD
313.465
Hang on.
314.362
# PENNY
314.612
What are you doing?
315.613
# LEONARD
315.863
Oh, I found a scratch-and-sniff book
about wine tasting.
318.699
319.300
**LOL**
320.201
It teaches
the different flavor notes to look for.
322.453
# PENNY
322.620
You actually smell the wine?
324.435
# LEONARD
324.435
I mostly just smell my nasal spray.
326.249
326.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
327.625
Are your sinuses acting up?
329.001
# LEONARD
329.001
Since my preschool got a bunny.
330.378
331.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
332.129
Hey, are you still hanging out
with Bernadette tonight?
334.174
# SHELDON
334.257
Yes, and we're going to prove that
we don't need alcohol to enjoy ourselves.
337.927
# PENNY
338.219
Oh, good for you.
339.220
# SHELDON
339.387
Or caffeine, tobacco, sushi, soft cheese,
processed meats and Jacuzzis,
343.975
344.141
which can all be harmful
to an unborn baby.
346.143
# PENNY
347.270
No honey-baked ham in a hot tub, got it.
349.188
349.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
350.273
No, and no bubble baths either.
351.441
351.524
They can increase the risk
of a urinary tract infection
353.359
# LEONARD
353.442
Okay, have fun.
353.942
# SHELDON
353.942
Yeah.
354.443
354.700
**LOL**
354.610
Oh, and no swordfish, king mackerel,
shark or tilefish,
357.738
357.905
which are all high in mercury.
359.032
359.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
359.115
We're leaving now!
360.157
# SHELDON
360.324
And no contact with guinea pigs
or hamsters or their droppings.
362.994
363.700
**LOL**
363.160
No cat litter boxes, no paint fumes
365.621

Oh, yeah, then we said
we should do it more often.

419.258
I don't know.

Hey guys, do me a favor, and don't ask
too many questions about the relationship.

**LOL**
438.945
We're just keeping it casual.
440.529

# SHELDON
479.944
Oh, I have quite the evening planned.
481.737
482.029
Yeah, our fetus-friendly
festival of fun begins,
485.241
484.800
**LOL**
485.449
with an in-depth look
at the world of model trains.
488.536
488.703
And then, we'll kick things up a notch,
490.263
490.371
and explore all the different ways
that you can make toast.
492.957
493.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
494.583
There's more than one?

Cool. 'Cause other than
when you broke up with him and dated me,
540.755
540.100
**LOL**
540.921
then broke up with me,
and then dated me one more time
543.132
543.299
before going back to him,

I was always rooting for you two.

Mike deGrasse Tyson?

# HOWARD
565.821
Yeah, you know, the boxer who grew
a mustache and became a scientist.
569.325
570.000
**LOL**
# ZACK
571.160
So, what's your invention?
572.244
# HOWARD
572.953
Well, we're using quantum vortices
to replace gyroscopes in guidance systems.
577.666
575.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
577.833
And what's neat is that they can
maintain angular momentum indefinitely.
580.920
578.500
**LOL**
# ZACK
581.504
Angular momentum.
I was wondering about that.
584.215
585.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
587.176
You could put it in a satellite
or a rocket, and it'll run forever.
591.138
# ZACK
591.347
Cool.
592.598
592.765
Could it be used
for missiles and war stuff?
594.850
594.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
595.684
Yeah, but we didn't create it for weapons.
598.354
597.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
598.521
And I doubt the military would be
interested in our little guidance system.
601.481
# ZACK
601.649
Is it better than the one they use now?
603.151
# HOWARD
603.234
A lot!
603.880
# LEONARD
603.880
Way better!
604.527
604.800

# ZACK
606.112
Huh.

H-O gauge trains are 1:87th scale.
620.042
620.209
N gauge are 1:160th scale.
622.962
623.295
And that brings us to Z gauge at a
625.464
625.631
"You could easily swallow it,
don't ask how I know," 1:220.
630.219
628.700

# BERNADETTE
630.719
I'm sorry, I have to ask.
632.054
633.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
632.930
When I was five,
I ingested a Z gauge locomotive.
635.599
635.766
I spent the next three days saying,
637.184
637.351
"I think I can pass it, I think
I can pass it, I think I can pass it."
640.521
639.100
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
643.357
What is it about trains
that you like so much?
645.401
# SHELDON
645.568
Interesting question.
647.695
648.362
When I was a child,
life was confusing and chaotic for me,
652.408
652.575
and trains represented order.
654.160
654.410
I could line them up,
categorize them, control them.
658.247
658.664
I guess you could say
659.748
660.207
that they gave me
a sense of calm in a world that didn't.
663.085
# BERNADETTE
664.044
That's lovely, Sheldon.
665.066
# SHELDON
665.066
Yeah.
666.088

Other than when they're
chugging through your bowels,
668.007
668.090
these things are magic.

# LEONARD
673.596
I have to admit, I've been worried
674.764
674.847
about the military applications
since we started talking about this.

677.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD

Me, too.
679.059
# LEONARD
679.435
Why didn't you say something?
680.595

680.728
Same reason I don't talk about ass cancer,
it's not a pleasant topic.

Almost any scientific advancement

690.779
# AMY
690.946
That's true.
Even Einstein's theory of relativity
693.240
693.407
was later applied
to the development of nuclear weapons.

E equals MC squared.
697.620

and "C" for the speed of light.

Guys, this is my friend, Claire.
717.765

We're casually dating, and there's no need
for any further questions about it.

# LEONARD

Would you like a glass of wine?

I said no questions.

# SHELDON

And last but not least,
730.861
731.028
this is one
that I like to call Star Wars Toast
734.156
734.323
because it has a light side
and a dark side.
738.410

741.956
All righty,
it's time for Dungeons and Dragons.

Dungeons and Dragons,
 that sounds about right.

You're going to enjoy this,
I designed it especially for you.
752.841
# BERNADETTE
753.008
Okay, but just for a little bit.
754.343
# SHELDON
755.052
Oh, I have a feeling that once you start,
756.637
756.720
you're not gonna want to,
or be allowed to, stop.
759.014
759.800

All right.

You bet.
764.103
# SHELDON
765.604
Your name is Bernatrix.
767.523
767.690
You are a warrior queen.
You're strong, beautiful, and tall.
772.027
# BERNADETTE
772.403
Ooh, I like the idea of being tall.
774.613
775.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
775.614
I think you're gonna like a lot of things
I have in store.
777.895
778.033
For example, in this world,
only the men get pregnant.
780.828
780.995
So, your husband is home
trying not to pee when he laughs.
784.206
785.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
785.749
This is getting fun. What's next?
787.167
# SHELDON
787.459
You're parched and weary from battle.
789.712
789.920
You stand in front of a tavern
791.588
791.755
that serves the coldest,
most delicious ale in all the realm.
795.301
# BERNADETTE
796.010
Oh, I haven't had a drink in months.
797.469
# SHELDON
798.178
What do you do?
799.263
# BERNADETTE
800.431
I storm in, slam my sword down, and say,
802.766
802.933
"Barkeep, bring me
the strongest ale you have
804.935
805.102
"and serve it in the skull of a goblin!"

inadvertently bring about Armageddon?

Okay, let me stop you right there.
876.490

We absolutely know our invention
will not be used to destroy the world.
880.636
# LEONARD
880.803
How?

The Hell Prawn
lunges out of the hot spring.

You block it with your shield.
Do you attack?
914.211
# BERNADETTE
914.461
Does it have eyes?
915.462
# SHELDON
915.671
Yeah, three giant red ones,
and they never blink. It's unsettling.
918.966
919.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
920.968
I stab it in the middle eye.
922.088
# SHELDON
923.679
Good choice! Critical hit!
925.222
925.389
Your sword goes through its eye,
into its tiny brain.
928.100
928.267
With its final dying gasp, it says,
930.519
930.686
"You have reduced me to a pile of sushi.
933.897
934.500
**LOL**
934.773
"Enjoy me with this packet of soy sauce.

"It's low sodium. Ah..."
940.904

# BERNADETTE
943.198
Okay, I guess I should eat the Hell Prawn.
944.878
# SHELDON
945.492
Using your sword,
you prepare a beautiful sushi dinner.
948.245
948.412
You slip into the hot spring, and enjoy
the warm water on your aching joints.
952.541
952.708
As you happily close your eyes, you recall
the incredible evening you've had,
956.712
956.879
and notice that your
958.881
959.756
feet and ankles
are smaller than they've ever been.

You know, ever since people found out
I'm having a baby,
980.861
981.028
I feel like I became
"Pregnant Bernadette."
983.280
983.447
It was nice
to take a little break tonight.
985.199
# SHELDON
985.782
I can understand that.
987.534
987.701
From the moment
people realized I was a genius,
989.620
989.786
I've been "Sheldon the Genius."
991.246
992.000
**LOL**
993.081
Although I've never really
wanted a break from that,
995.121
995.250
so I suppose I don't understand.
996.668
997.100
