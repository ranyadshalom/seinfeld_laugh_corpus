It's from Game of Thrones.
10.261
10.428
What do you think?
11.762
# SHELDON
11.762
I don't know.
13.097
13.264
If we're going to start
a fantasy sword collection
15.850
16.017
And I've long thought we should.
17.685
18.400
**LOL**
19.145
Is this really the sword to start with?
21.189
# LEONARD
21.356
What did you have in mind?
22.982
# SHELDON
23.149
Well, off the top of my head,
I'd have to go with Excalibur.
27.237
27.403
It gives you the right to rule England.
29.989
29.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
30.782
It would be a replica of a movie prop.
32.784
# SHELDON
33.868
Fair enough.
34.911
35.078
It would give you the right
to rule a replica of England.
38.456
38.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
39.457
Well, they don't have an Excalibur here,
so, what do you want to do?
42.835
# SHELDON
43.002
Ugh, tough decision.
45.129
45.505
There's no weaponry
from Lord of the Rings...
47.674
47.840
...forged in a Chinese sweatshop?
50.343
50.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
51.678
Mm-hm, just Bilbo Baggins'
sword over there.
54.305
# SHELDON
54.806
Two grown men with a hobbit's dagger,
wouldn't we look silly?
58.685
58.400
**LOL**
60.895
Okay, let's go for it.
61.792
61.792
Heh.
62.689
# STUART
62.855
Oh, I see you guys have found
my little treasure.
65.191
# LEONARD
65.358
Yeah, pfft, it's okay, I guess.
67.986
# SHELDON
68.152
Okay? It's magnificent.
69.821
# LEONARD
69.988
Buh-buh-buh-buh.
71.489
71.600
**LOL**
73.533
What do you want for it?
75.076
# STUART
75.243
Oh, it's hard to
put a price on something...
77.161
77.328
...that's a copy of something
that was on pay cable.
79.831
80.600
**LOL**
81.207
But for my friends, let's say 250.
83.334
# LEONARD
83.501
Ooh, that's pretty steep.
84.982
# STUART
84.982
It's a limited edition.
86.462
86.629
They only made 8000 of these
bad boys.
89.924
89.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
90.091
Only 8000.
We're wasting precious time. Buy it.
93.469
93.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
94.304
Hang on. Can you do any better?
97.390
# STUART
97.557
I'm already giving
you the friends and family discount.
100.435
# SHELDON
100.602
Oh, did you hear that?
The friends and family discount.
103.187
103.200
**LOL**
103.354
We are honored and we will take it.
105.648
# LEONARD
105.815
Slow down. Two hundred.
108.067
# SHELDON
108.234
What are you doing?
250 is already a discounted price.
110.820
111.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
110.987
Will you shut up?
112.447
# STUART
112.447
Tell you what, I'll go 235.
113.906
# LEONARD
114.073
Nope. Maybe another time.
115.325
# STUART
115.491
Okay, 225, my final offer.
117.472
# SHELDON
117.472
Take it, take it.
119.454
119.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
121.039
Two hundred.
122.269
# STUART
122.269
Man, you're killing me.
123.499
# SHELDON
123.666
Killing you? I can't breathe.
125.710
125.800
**LOL**
# STUART
126.961
Two ten and I'm losing money.
129.047
# SHELDON
129.213
Oh, no, we can't let him lose money,
Leonard. I'm so sorry.
131.883
131.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
132.592
Two ten and you throw in
the Iron Man helmet.
135.011
# STUART
135.178
Are you crazy? That helmet's
signed by Robert Downey, Jr.
137.805
# LEONARD
137.972
So?
139.057
# STUART
139.557
If you're gonna question
the importance of a signature...
142.268
142.435
...on a plastic helmet from a movie
based on a comic book...
145.313
145.480
...then all of our lives
have no meaning.
148.775
148.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
152.820
Okay, fine. Just the sword, 210.
155.281
# STUART
155.281
Thank you. I can eat meat this week.
157.742
158.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
160.036
See that? I just saved us 40 bucks.
162.205
# SHELDON
162.372
I've long said that what you lack
in academic knowledge...
164.653
164.791
...you make up for in street smarts.
167.168
166.600
**LOL**
# STUART
167.335
You want me to wrap it?
168.274
# LEONARD
168.274
No, it's okay.
169.212
169.379
I'm gonna stab my friend in the chest.
172.215
172.100
**LOL**
173.299
Hey, Stuart.
174.300
# STUART
174.300
Ah, hey, Wil.

175.468
Hello, Wil Wheaton.

**LOL**
# WIL
180.014
Hi, Sheldon. Nice sword.
181.766
# SHELDON
181.766
It's part of my sword collection.
183.518
183.685
Do you have a sword collection?
184.832
# WIL
184.832
No.
185.978
# SHELDON
186.145
Heh, I'm not surprised.
188.398
188.100
**LOL**
# STUART
189.148
Here's the Batman six twelve...
191.192
191.359
...with the Jim Lee alternate cover
that you wanted.
193.861
# WIL
194.028
Oh, awesome. What do I owe you?
195.279
# STUART
195.279
Forty bucks.
196.531
# WIL
196.698
Good deal.
197.595
# SHELDON
197.595
Sucker.
198.491
198.658
He didn't even ask
for the friends and family discount.
201.452
201.300
**LOL**
# WIL
201.619
I'm having a party on Friday
and I was hoping you would stop by.
204.706
# STUART
204.872
Will there be girls there?
205.935
# WIL
205.935
Of course.
206.999
# STUART
207.166
Because there wasn't last time.

211.838
There will be girls.
213.214

You guys are invited
if you want to come by.
215.883
# LEONARD
216.050
Thank you.
217.948
# WIL
217.948
All right, great. Later.
219.846
# SHELDON
221.889
I see what you're doing.
223.766
223.933
You accept an invitation to a party
at the home of my sworn enemy.
227.103
227.270
He tells everyone
we're going to be there.
229.272
229.439
And when we don't show,
he looks the fool. Fiendishly clever.
232.400
232.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
234.444
I was actually thinking about going.
236.696
# SHELDON
237.238
And then declaring the party
a fiasco and storming out...
239.949
240.116
...leaving him humiliated
in front of his guests. Love it.
243.828
243.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
244.954
No, I was gonna grab Raj
and Howard and have a good time.
249.083

Ah, great, more guys.
251.169
251.335
It's gonna be another Wil Wheaton
sausage-fest.

# LEONARD
280.406
Sheldon, can you grab me a water?
282.096

Can you or can't you?
286.120

It's not that simple, Leonard.

It never is, is it?
290.041
289.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
290.708
At this moment,
our relationship exists...
293.169
293.336
...in two mutually contradictory states.
295.588
295.755
Until you either do not go
or go to Wil Wheaton's party...
299.717
299.884
...you are simultaneously
my friend and not my friend.
303.137
304.100
**LOL**
305.014
I'm characterizing this phenomenon
as Schrֳ¶dinger's friendship.

311.395
Got it. Can I have my water?
312.730
# SHELDON
312.730
Yeah, of course.
314.065
314.232
Now get it yourself, you traitor.

# PENNY
319.278
Wait, what is going on?
320.592
# SHELDON

In case you have forgotten...
321.906
322.073
...Schrֳ¶dinger's cat is a thought--
323.741
# PENNY
323.741
No, I didn't forget.
325.409
325.576
Um, there's this cat in a box
and until you open it...
328.454
328.621
...it's either dead or alive or both.
330.581
330.748
Although our cat got stuck
in my brother's camp trunk...
333.709
333.876
...and we did not need to open it to know
there was all kinds of dead cat in there.
337.922

Homespun stories, knowledge
of physics and a bosom that defies it.

aren't you?
345.304
344.600
**LOL**

Sorry I'm late. Ugh, I got great news.
349.934
350.101
NASA picked my team's design
for the deep field space telescope...
353.938
354.105

361.011
361.153
It gets better. Someone has
to go up with the telescope...
364.240
364.407
...as a payload specialist,
and guess who that someone is, heh.
369.120
# SHELDON
369.287
Muhammad Li.
371.497
370.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
373.165
Who's Muhammad Li?
374.876
# SHELDON
375.042
Muhammad is the most
common first name in the world...
377.628
377.795
...Li, the most common surname.
379.380
379.547
As I didn't know the answer, I thought
that gave me a mathematical edge.
383.050
383.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
384.218
It's me, Sheldon. It's me.
I'm going up in space!
387.430

Hang on a second.
393.853

NASA doesn't have a shuttle anymore.
395.521
395.688
How are you gonna get up there?
396.748
# HOWARD
396.748
Oh, uh, it's cool.
397.808
397.940
You fly to Moscow,
they take you to Kazakhstan.
400.192
400.359
Then you get in a Russian Soyuz rocket
which shoots you into a low earth orbit.
404.196
404.363
Or it just sits on the launch pad because
the Kazakhi mafia sold the rocket fuel...
407.658
407.825
...on the black market, heh.
410.369
409.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE

Are those Russian rockets safe?
413.539
# HOWARD
413.706
Safe as it can be...
414.790
414.957
...when it was built by the folks
who brought you Chernobyl. Ha, ha.

# LEONARD

The dream to go up into space

...and Howard's making that a reality.
We're all very proud of you.

472.974
I can't believe you signed up for
the space program without talking to me.

477.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
478.646
I get it. We--
You're worried about me.

That is so sweet. You know,
there's a saying we have at NASA.
489.073
488.900

What an honor it is

# BERNADETTE
521.105
Yeah, I get it. I just wish
you included me in the decision.

We never knew
from one night to the next...

It's on a five and a quarter inch floppy.

As a child, I loved Wesley Crusher...
683.559
683.726
...Wil Wheaton's character
on Star Trek.
685.603
685.769
So I drove for hours by bus
to a Star Trek convention...
688.689
688.856
...at which Wil Wheaton
was scheduled to appear...
691.233
691.400
...so that I could get
my Wesley Crusher action figure signed.
694.403
694.570
But he never showed...
695.654
695.821
...because apparently,
it was "cooler" for him...
698.282
698.449
...to be the lower-left corner
on Hollywood Squares.
701.327
701.700
**LOL**
703.996
Oh, damn! The floppy failed.
706.916

of quality control...

You see betrayal in others
