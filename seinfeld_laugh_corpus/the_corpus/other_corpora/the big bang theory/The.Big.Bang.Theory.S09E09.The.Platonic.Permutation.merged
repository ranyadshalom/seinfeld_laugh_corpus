Have you guys seen
this feature that lets you talk to Siri
5.832
5.970
without pressing any buttons?
7.514
# HOWARD
7.764
No, how does it work?
9.140
# RAJ
9.390
You just say,
"Hey, Siri, what time is it?"
12.435
# SIRI
12.602
The time is 6:37 p.m.
15.063
# HOWARD
16.272
So now anyone can control your phone?
18.274
18.441
Hey, Siri, show me pictures
of naked grandma butts!
21.319
21.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
22.320
Nice try, it only recognizes my voice.
24.260
# HOWARD
24.260
Oh, cool.
26.199
26.366
Hey, Siri, show me
pictures of naked grandma butts!
29.327

**LOL**
# RAJ
30.370
I don't sound like that.

# SIRI
32.914
Here are some images
of naked grandma butts.
35.458

# SHELDON
37.001
Hey! Good news, everybody.
38.962
39.128
Now that I'm no longer with Amy,
I have an extra ticket
42.131
42.298
to the annual Thanksgiving lunch buffet
at the aquarium cafeteria.
45.176
45.343
Who wants it?
46.386
48.100
**LOL**
49.430
You realize you won't be going alone.
I'll be there the whole time.
52.517
53.000
**LOL**
54.018
Providing fish and pilgrim facts.
56.312
58.815
Can you people hear me?
60.233
60.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
61.442
Well, we're having everyone over.
62.986
# PENNY
63.152
Yeah, Leonard and I are cooking all day.
64.737
# LEONARD
64.737
Otherwise, we'd love to.
66.322
# PENNY
66.489
But we can't. Mmm-hmm.
67.595
# LEONARD
67.595
Poor us.
68.700
70.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
# BERNADETTE
72.203
And Raj and I are volunteering at the soup
kitchen feeding food to the homeless.
75.999
# SHELDON
76.332
Oh, Howard, what about you?
78.251
# HOWARD
78.543
Oh, I can't, I'm going
to the soup kitchen, too.
82.338
# BERNADETTE
83.715
You said that sounded
like the worst thing ever.
85.800
86.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
87.594
If you can't support me when I'm lying,
why are we married?
90.680

**LOL**
118.600
**LOL**
121.044
Hi, Sheldon, what's up?
122.545
# SHELDON
122.920
Well, I'm calling because
Thanksgiving is coming up
125.757
125.923
and I wanted to offer you
the aquarium tickets.
128.968
# AMY
129.135
No one can go with you?
130.470
# SHELDON
130.762
No, they'd rather spend the holiday
with each other
133.389
133.556
than find out if this
is the year I finally touch a starfish.
136.601
136.900
**LOL**
137.935
Anyway, I wouldn't want the tickets
to go to waste,
140.271
140.480
so take whomever you'd like.
142.315
# AMY
142.565
Oh?
143.941
144.275
Okay, thank you.
146.069
# SHELDON
146.361
And feel free to tell your guest
that the Myanmar catfish
149.906
150.073
is also known as the pilgrim fish.
151.866
152.075
In case the turkey's dry
and you need something juicy.
155.411
156.100
**LOL**
# AMY
156.788
Sheldon, I can tell you want to go,
159.415
159.624
so if you'd be comfortable with it,
maybe we could go as friends.
163.711
# SHELDON
164.837
You don't think that will be awkward?
166.589
# AMY
166.881
Well, it is Thanksgiving
in an aquarium cafeteria,
170.093
170.343
so I'm gonna go out
on a limb here and say yes.
172.183
173.000
**LOL**
173.429
But if you mean between us,
I think it'll be fine.
177.392
# SHELDON
178.935
Very well, then.
I'll see you on Thanksgiving morning.
181.688
# AMY
182.021
See you then.
183.022
# SHELDON
183.272
Oh, forget what I said
about the Myanmar catfish.
186.234
186.401
My list of marine-themed
pilgrim facts is pretty short.
189.570
# AMY
189.904
Did you know they served shellfish
and eel at the first Thanksgiving?
192.865
# SHELDON
193.116
And there goes my list.
194.450
194.800
**LOL**
# EMILY
198.913
So, how does this work?
200.540
# BERNADETTE
200.790
The soup kitchen manager assigns
the jobs and the shifts are six hours.
204.502
# HOWARD
204.752

205.294
205.294
Six hours?
205.837
206.295
I don't wanna
complain for that long.
209.048
209.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
210.675
Do you ever do anything for anyone else?
212.635

I happen to be a giving
and generous lover.

219.475
Are you and I close
enough for me to say that's creepy?
221.635
# BERNADETTE
221.769
We are and I believe the word you're
looking for is...
224.689
225.600
**LOL**
227.024
Uh, can I help you?
228.463
# BERNADETTE
228.463
Hi, we'd like to volunteer.
229.902
230.194
Oh, I appreciate you guys coming down,
but we already have enough people.
233.073
233.156
Any other day, please, come back.
234.876
# BERNADETTE
235.324
Oh, okay.
236.492
240.500
**LOL**
242.165
Wipe that smug smile off your face.
244.125
# HOWARD
244.417
Maybe I'm happy that so many people
turned up to help the less fortunate.
248.880
248.500
**LOL**
# EMILY
251.007
Are you and I close enough for me to say
252.676
# BERNADETTE
252.759
That he's an ass? He beat you to it.
254.427
254.300
**LOL**
255.845
Uh, I was wrong.
A large group had to cancel.
257.847
# BERNADETTE
258.139
Oh, great, we'd love to help!

Hey, the recipes are on my iPad.
Will you pull 'em up?
285.458
# PENNY
285.666
Yep. What's the code?
286.688
# LEONARD
286.688
My birthday.
287.710
# PENNY
289.170
It's not working.
290.505

290.755
It's just four digits.
The month and day.

Nope.

Yeah. There.

322.620
# PENNY
324.038
I'm not gonna say your password out loud,
that is not secure.
327.333

328.376
You don't know
your own husband's birthday!
331.003

You don't know everything about me.
332.860
# LEONARD
332.860
Your birthday is December second.
334.507
334.757
You grew up on Perkin Street.
335.917
336.092
The last four digits of your social
are seven-six-two-one.
339.095
339.262
And the odds of me letting
you forget this are zero!
342.431

Ready for the aquarium?
355.882
# SHELDON
355.882
I am.
357.154
357.572
And in an effort to reduce awkwardness
as we learn how to function as friends,
361.742
361.951
I printed out a list of safe topics
for polite conversation.
365.538
366.500
**LOL**
# AMY
367.373
If that makes you more comfortable.
369.500
# SHELDON
370.251
If there were a list of things
that make me more comfortable,
372.795
372.962
lists would be on the top of that list.
375.006
375.700
**LOL**
376.632
Okay, now, oh, since last we spoke,
have you acquired any pets?

# SHELDON
383.347
No.

386.642
Um, since last we spoke,
have you planned or gone on any vacations?
391.230
# AMY
391.480
I might go visit my aunt next week.
393.482
# SHELDON
393.983
Your aunt in Modesto?
395.443
# AMY
395.443
No. The one in Bakersfield.
396.903
# SHELDON
397.153
Bakersfield, I see.
398.821
399.822
Where has this list been all my life?
401.741
402.300
**LOL**
404.493
We're gonna have you washing dishes.
406.704
406.954
Uh, aprons and rubber gloves are here.
Just scrape, wash and stack.
410.791
411.000
If you need me, I'll be around.
412.240
# HOWARD
413.336
So we don't even get to be
up front where the action is?
415.880
# BERNADETTE
416.088
What difference does it make?
417.548
# HOWARD
417.840
I don't know. I was hoping some poor kid
would come up to me and say,
421.052
421.260
"Please, sir. I want some more."
423.300
423.400

You're in a soup kitchen,
not a production of Oliver!

It's not like I'm expecting them to sing.
434.298
437.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
437.944
Then the next day was 73 degrees,
then the day after that was 72,
441.948
442.198
and then it was 72 again,
443.616
443.866
then it was 74,
and that brings us to today, at...
447.203
446.300
**LOL**
447.536
I'd wear shorts if I had a pair, 78.
450.039
450.900
**LOL**
# AMY
452.166
Are we done discussing the weather?
453.834
# SHELDON
454.835
I don't know if I'd call it "discussing,"
456.587
456.796
you kind of sat back
and let me do all the work.
458.676
459.400
**LOL**
460.216
Let's see what's next on the list. Oh!

465.721
Sheldon!
We've known each other a long time.
469.850
466.500

We are perfectly capable
of having a conversation

473.104
without relying
on a list off the Internet.
475.398
# SHELDON
477.149
All right, what should we talk about?
479.610
# AMY
480.319
I don't know, just ask me
whatever comes to mind.
482.697
# SHELDON
483.864
Very well.
I know you've been seeing other men.
487.910

Have you had coitus with any of them?

I know you hate the word "moist,"

# PENNY
529.285
Hang on, wait, wait.
Why don't I like the lingerie you got me?
531.829

Because it's orange and you think
it makes you look like a slutty carrot.

You know, I read that washing dishes

The key is that while washing the dishes,
one should only be "washing the dishes."

Just because you have that accent
doesn't mean what you say isn't stupid.
604.360

**LOL**
# RAJ
605.653
No, seriously,
it's about being present in the moment.
608.823
609.031
Focusing on the feeling of the warm water.
The smell of the detergent,
613.702
613.911
the sound of the dishes squeaking
and following your own breath.
617.164
617.373
It's about simply being.

No, it's okay.
726.148
726.565
If we're friends,
we should be able to talk about anything.
729.401
# SHELDON
729.652
All right.
730.986
# AMY
731.487
So, you had some questions
about me seeing other people.
735.366
# SHELDON
736.450
Just a few.

# AMY

# SHELDON
739.662
How many dates have you been on?
Who were they with?
742.539
742.831
Where did you go? Where did you meet them?
Did you sleep with them?
745.668
744.200
**LOL**
745.876
And how much longer to the aquarium?
I'm getting kind of hungry.
749.129
749.200
**LOL**
# AMY
751.006
Let's see...
752.424
753.008
I've been on six dates
with three different people.
756.220
756.845
It was either for coffee or dinner.
758.973
759.390
One I met at a bookstore
and two I met online.
762.601
763.352
I haven't slept with anyone,
the aquarium is 40 minutes away,
766.522
766.689
and there's a baggie of Cheerios for you
in the glove compartment.
769.289

**LOL**
# SHELDON
770.484
Is that regular or Honey Nut?
772.444
# AMY
773.237
I mixed them.
774.571
# SHELDON
774.863
You mixed them. No wonder gentleman
callers are pounding down your door.
779.034
779.600
**LOL**
781.787
Do you have any questions for me?
783.664
# AMY

Just one.
787.376

Are you doing okay?

833.505
Well, I was on the turkey line,
but I got demoted
835.425

for being too generous with the gravy.

Feels great to come down here

# HOWARD
856.111
Oh, yeah.

Nothing better than helping people.

862.500
**LOL**
864.203
Which is something I realized
when I was viewing Earth
868.957
869.291
from the deck
of the International Space Station
872.002
872.628
where I spent two months
as a payload specialist,
875.589
875.798
a job I was qualified for
because I'm an MIT-trained engineer.
879.802
880.700
**LOL**
# ELON
881.845
And I thought I ladled the gravy on thick.

# HOWARD
886.141
Sorry. It's just... You're you...
888.811
889.436
And I really want you to adopt me.
891.480
892.300
**LOL**
# ELON
892.731
Well, you're here on Thanksgiving,
so you're probably a good person.
895.651
# HOWARD
895.901
Oh, I made my wife come down, too.
897.903
898.600
**LOL**
# ELON
900.030
You think you might ever
get back out to space?
902.116
# HOWARD
902.825
Is that a job offer?
'Cause I really wanna go to Mars.
905.994
906.245
Assuming I can bring my wife.
907.663
907.830
She hardly takes up any room.
She's basically a carry-on.
910.541
910.900
**LOL**
# ELON
912.167
Well, we're not quite there yet,
but we're always looking for engineers.
914.920
915.003
So let me give you my email,
we can stay in touch.
916.963
# HOWARD
917.131
Thank you.
918.173
# ELON
920.676
Oh, look.
921.677
921.927
Someone hardly touched their pumpkin pie.
Want to share it with me?
925.347
925.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
928.267
A partially eaten piece of pumpkin pie
from a homeless shelter?
932.938
933.188
With Elon Musk? You bet I do!
934.773
935.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
940.863
You know, for a Thanksgiving buffet in an
aquarium cafeteria, that was really bad.
945.701
945.800
**LOL**
# AMY
947.077
You're just upset
'cause they ran out of pilgrim hats.
949.197
# SHELDON
949.705
They gave one to that baby,
he wasn't even awake.
952.249
952.900
**LOL**
# AMY
953.625
Well, it wouldn't be a holiday
without you being mad at a baby.
956.837
956.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
959.256
Oh, would you care to play
an ocean-themed game I invented?
962.509
# AMY
962.885
Sure, what is it?
964.553
# SHELDON
964.553
It's called Food, Friend, Fight.
966.221
966.430
One of us chooses three aquatic creatures
and the other one must decide
970.058
970.267
which he would eat, befriend, or battle.
972.644
973.200
**LOL**
# AMY
974.271
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.
976.190
# SHELDON
976.607
What is that?
977.649
# AMY
977.816
It's a game where
you're given three people
979.735
979.902
and you choose
which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.
982.112
# SHELDON
982.779
Well, my game is better because instead
of marrying someone, you get to eat them.
986.825
986.700
**LOL**
# AMY
987.701
Let's just play
988.785
# SHELDON
989.077
I'll start you off easy.
Electric eel, puffer fish, shrimp.
994.750
# AMY
995.792
Hmm.
996.919
997.127
Well, I wouldn't fight the eel
999.129
999.338
because I know it can generate
enough current to kill a horse.
1001.924
1002.424
So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp,
and befriend the puffer fish
1006.803
1007.012
because it would be nice to have
company on those days I feel bloated.
1010.057
1011.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1011.642
Very well done.
1012.601
# AMY
1012.601
Thank you.
1013.560
1013.810
Okay, your turn.
1015.145
1015.812
Um... Seal, hagfish...
1019.441
1020.776
SpongeBob SquarePants.
1022.986
1022.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1024.029
Well, I'd befriend SpongeBob, but he's not
real, so I can't do that, can I?
1027.366
# AMY
1027.866
But you can pal around with a hagfish?
1029.826
# SHELDON
1029.993
Hey, let's not pull at that thread.
1031.828
1032.200
**LOL**
1032.955
Okay, I'll fight SpongeBob.
1035.415
1035.624
Because he's so friendly,
we'll just end up tickling each other.
1039.086
1038.900
**LOL**
1039.294
Um, I'll befriend the seal
because he's trainable,
1041.964
1042.130
which was the problem I'm having
with my current friends.
1044.466
1044.400
**LOL**
1044.633
Which means I'll have to eat the hagfish.
1047.553
# AMY
1048.637
Isn't that gross?
1049.721
1049.930
A hagfish can produce enough mucus
to fill a bucket in a minute.
1053.058
# SHELDON
1053.517
I know. It makes its own gravy,
it'll slide right down.
1056.478
1057.500
**LOL**
# AMY
1061.984
I miss this.
1063.318
# SHELDON
1066.029
How can you miss a game
you've never played before, silly?
1069.199
1068.800

Amy, I excel at many things,
