If they took all the money they spent
trying to make a decent Hulk movie...
9.218
9.385
...they could probably
just make an actual Hulk.
12.013
11.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
12.763
That is apt and amusing.
14.390
15.391
I think I shall share that
with Amy Farrah Fowler.
18.477
18.300
**LOL**
19.562
She'll appreciate the witticism.
20.876
# LEONARD
20.876
Thank you.
22.189
# SHELDON
22.356
It will also help improve
her initial impression of you.
25.568
25.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
27.028
So, what's going on with you two?
29.134
# SHELDON
29.134
Oh, the status is as it always was.
31.240
31.407
She's a girl, she's a friend.
32.867
33.034
She's not my, please forgive me
for doing this, "girlfriend."
37.163
37.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
37.997
Right, right.
39.081
39.665
So you're still just texting
and e-mailing?
41.751
41.917
You don't feel any need to hang out with
her, you know, be in the same room?
45.421
# SHELDON
46.547
Leonard, you are my best friend.
48.507
48.674
I've known you for seven years...
50.343
50.509
...and I can barely tolerate
sitting on the couch with you.
53.596
53.800
**LOL**
54.305
Uh, imagine my attitude...
55.556
55.723
...regarding prolonged physical proximity
to Amy Farrah Fowler.
59.143
59.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
60.186
Got it.
61.562
# SHELDON
61.729
Well, I sense judgment on your part.
63.293
# LEONARD
63.293
No, no.
64.857
65.858
Maybe a little.
67.610
67.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
68.486
May I suggest that your criticism
is based on jealousy?
71.906
# LEONARD
72.073
Heh, jealousy? What do I have
to be jealous of?
74.700
# SHELDON
74.867
I have a functioning
and satisfying relationship with a female.
78.621
80.581
And you have none.
82.208
81.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
82.917
Oh, right. That. Hmm.
84.960
# SHELDON
85.127
Jealousy is an ugly green-eyed monster,
not unlike the Hulk.
88.339
88.506
Who, by the way,
also has a girlfriend.
91.467
91.800
**LOL**
91.634
In this iteration, Jennifer Connelly.
93.636
93.803
Whom you may recall as the girlfriend
of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind.
97.431
97.598
A feel-good romp
if there ever was one.
100.726
100.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
102.019
I'm not jealous.
103.104

105.064
Leonard not jealous.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
133.759
You know, it just occurred to me.
135.761
135.928
If there are an infinite number
of parallel universes...
138.973
139.140
...in one of them,
there's probably a Sheldon...
141.809
141.976
...who doesn't believe
parallel universes exist.
145.312
145.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
146.188
Probably. What's your point?
147.315
# SHELDON
147.315
No point.
148.441
148.607
It's just one of the things
that makes one of the me's chuckle.
151.569
152.900
**LOL**
154.655
What makes you chuckle, Leonard?
157.137
# LEONARD
157.137
Um, recently? Not much.
159.618
# SHELDON
159.785
Is it because of the conflict
that arises...
161.704
161.871
...from your desperate need
to pair bond with a woman...
164.331
164.498
...and the apparent collective decision
of all womankind...
167.168
167.334
...to deny you that opportunity?
169.295
169.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
170.838
Um...

172.631
Shut up.

# SHELDON
174.967
You know, when my grandfather
died and Meemaw was alone...
178.345
178.512
...my Mom arranged for her
to visit a center three times a week...
181.682
181.849
...where she could socialize
with other lonely people.
185.227
185.500
**LOL**
185.394
It's very nice.
186.520
186.687
They discuss current events,
play bridge, get a hot meal.
190.065
# LEONARD
190.232
That sounds lovely.
192.276
# SHELDON
192.276
Um, it is if you like bridge.
194.320
194.862
Do you like bridge, Leonard?

**LOL**
# LEONARD
197.281
Sheldon, I'm just
not dating someone right now.
199.992
200.159
I don't need to go
to a seniors' center.
203.120
202.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
204.038
Meemaw resisted at first,
but now she loves it.
207.833
207.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
208.000
Fine. If I don't meet someone soon,
you can put me in a home.
211.253
211.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
211.420
It's not a home.
It's a senior center.
215.341

We'd never put Meemaw
in a home.

227.520
Excuse me.
That's my girlfriend Bernadette.
229.396

I assigned her own ring tone.
"Bernadette" by The Four Tops.

that I think about it is not so good.

# LEONARD
243.702
You realize
he's just rubbing our noses...

254.546
Uh, two words: Deaf chick.
256.590
257.200

275.734
# STUART
275.901
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I met her at Comic-Con.
278.612
278.779
The one place in the world where saying
"I own a comic book store"...
281.782
281.949
...is an actual pick-up line.

Not really. She's horrible.

288.539
When she wants to have sex, she puts on
her plus-size Wonder Woman costume...
291.917

in my invisible plane?"
295.963

Dude, why don't you just invoke
your girlfriend pact with Wolowitz?

Uh, because I don't need his girlfriend
to set me up with one of her girlfriends.
314.815
314.982
I'm perfectly capable
of finding a girl on my own.
318.319
# RAJ
318.485
Oh, Leonard. You remind me
of the funny old story about a man...
321.822
321.989
...who walks into
a women's correctional institution...
324.491
324.658
...with a stack of paperwork...
326.160
326.327
...that would allow
the female convicts to go free.

You're saying I couldn't get laid in a
women's prison with a handful of pardons.

I don't know. Maybe.

Since we got home

Go on, Amy.
380.798
# AMY
380.965
From a neurological standpoint...
382.549
382.716
you may be alone
because your psychological state...
385.260

...is causing an actual pheromone-based
stink of desperation.

Have you tried a bar or tavern?

# LEONARD
401.026
No, I'm not gonna
pick up a woman in a bar.
403.112
# SHELDON
403.320
Wise decision. You see, Amy...
405.364
405.531
...success at a bar
is based on classic male attributes...
408.867
409.034
...such as:
height, strength, attractiveness...
411.954
412.121
...the ability to hold one's liquor
and throw darts, separately or together.
416.083
416.250
Leonard has none of these attributes,
right, Leonard?
419.628
420.100

Oh, good point, Amy.
429.054
429.221
Yeah. Building on your premise...
430.848
431.015
...Leonard could frequent sushi bars,
salad bars...

...oyster bars,
the Apple Genius Bar.

It was going well.
621.705
621.872
I was showing this super hot girl
how to boot up in safe mode...
624.708
624.875
...the manager got suspicious and...
626.835
627.002
Well, long story short, they really
do have a little jail in the mall.

# HOWARD

Just FYI, don't try to go back
with a fake mustache.

I mean, they may not really be geniuses,
but they see right through that.

I wanna invoke the girlfriend pact,

# LEONARD
644.102
No, uh, I just...
You know, I want what you have.
646.313
646.480
You know,
I want a woman in my life.
648.148
648.315
MRS.

Holy Moses,
how much liquid can be in one tuchus?

To be clear, I meant Bernadette,

As if one of the plants...
670.921
671.088
...from Invasion of the Body Snatchers
duplicated you in every way...
674.341
674.508
...only with an absurd amount
of hair gel.

**LOL**
# LEONARD
678.345
What are you working on?
679.513
# SHELDON
679.680
I'm removing my digital footprint
from the Internet...
682.641
682.808
...so Amy Farrah Fowler can't find me
and compel me to meet her mother.
686.270

She'll get lost.
We no longer live at 2311 Los Robles.

We now live at 311 Los Robles.

# SHELDON
717.926
No worries, I explained
my predicament to our letter carrier.
720.846
721.013
He was sympathetic. His exact words
were, "Got your back, Jack.

The only flaw

# LEONARD
752.606
Where are you?
753.420
# SHELDON
753.587
I don't know.
You'll have to devise a scenario...
755.756
755.922
...that plausibly explains my absence...
757.674
757.841
...keeping in mind that the key
to a good lie lies in the details.

One time at my lab...
793.877
794.044
...a Petri dish of genetically modified
super-virus went missing.
797.130
797.297
That day, we made a pinky swear...
798.924

Ebola with the common cold.

No misunderstanding.

that request actually means...

1010.927
...and I don't want
to be joined to another object...

All I wanna do is present you
as my boyfriend to my mother...

1024.149
...so she'll be satisfied
that I'm in a relationship.
1026.985
# SHELDON
1027.152
So we'd be perpetrating a ruse?
1028.841

Don't be absurd.
