Interesting.
Do you recall this conversation?
8.515
8.723
"Leonard, wanna go halfsies
on a steamer?"
11.059
11.309
"No, Sheldon, we don't need a steamer."
13.895
13.800

Looks like that rumpled
chicken's come home to roost.

# PENNY

Hi. Here are the makeup
sponges you asked for.
21.194
# LEONARD
21.402
Oh, thanks, I thought I had more.
22.695
# PENNY
22.695
Hmm.
23.988
26.000
**LOL**
27.492
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.
30.328
30.537
You've got better makeup than I do.
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.
34.040
34.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
34.249
Hey, hey, hey,
this is my Comic-Con makeup.
37.377
37.585
I love you, but there are some things
a man doesn't share with his girlfriend.
41.339
41.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
42.006
That's a wise policy.
43.716
43.925
I once borrowed my sister's makeup
for a costume contest...
46.678
46.886
...got a terrible case of pink eye.
48.596
48.805
Yeah, well, luckily, I was going
as a zombie, I won second place.
52.225
52.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
53.601
You guys just went to Comic-Con.
55.228
# LEONARD
55.436
That was San Diego Comic-Con.
This is Bakersfield Comic-Con.
58.439
58.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
59.232
Is that better?
60.296
# LEONARD
60.296
Well, it's a lot smaller.
61.359
61.568
It's about the comic books.
62.819
63.027
The way these conventions used to be
before they went Hollywood.
65.947
# SHELDON
66.197
So to answer your question,
no, it's not better.
68.616
68.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
70.118
Then why are you going?
71.286
# SHELDON
71.828
It's a comic book convention.
73.413
73.621
Like pizza or particle accelerators...
75.540
75.748
...even the stinky ones, still pretty good.
77.959
77.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
78.835
Well, you guys have fun.
I guess I'll see you Sunday.
81.379
# LEONARD
81.588
Yeah. Oh, hang on a second.
82.672
# PENNY
82.672
Okay.
83.756
# LEONARD
83.965
Hold this.
85.800
89.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
90.763
What was that for?
92.369
# LEONARD
92.369
To show people when they don't believe me.
93.975
122.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
122.462
This is the best. You have booze with
breakfast on Tuesday, you got a problem.
126.049
126.299
You do it on the weekend,
you got brunch.
128.635
128.300
**LOL**
# AMY
129.135
Sheldon doesn't believe in brunch.
130.762
130.970
Can't stand a table where one person's having
an omelet and another is having a sandwich.
135.558
# BERNADETTE
136.434
That's not exhausting at all.
138.936
139.000
**LOL**
141.898
Oh.
142.940
143.149
It's Leonard. He says they're on the road
and headed for Bakersfield at warp speed.
147.570
148.071
Maybe it's the mimosa,
but I'm gonna give the kid an LOL.
151.074
151.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
153.076
Cute how excited they are.
154.369
154.577
You should have seen Howard
sewing his costume all week.
157.330
# AMY
157.830
When did Howard learn to sew?
159.248
# BERNADETTE
159.499
When he was a little boy, every couple of
months he'd have to let his mom's pants out.
163.544
163.900
**LOL**
# AMY
166.798
I don't understand
why they go to these conventions.
169.175
# PENNY
169.384
The four of them work at a major
university, they're all smart...
172.470
172.679
...how can they be into something
for 12-year-olds?
175.056
# BERNADETTE
175.264
I don't mind it. I think Howie's
just in touch with his inner child.
179.060
179.268
Although when he's in Batman pajamas...
181.104
181.354
...sometimes it feels like
I'm touching his inner child.
184.357
184.600
**LOL**
# AMY
187.026
It's probably because they were bullied.
In a world where you can't fight back...
190.780
191.030
...superheroes provide
meaningful wish-fulfillment.
193.032
# PENNY
193.241
Hmm. Now I feel bad for picking on
all those kids.
196.911
197.120
Although if Danny Biffle
didn't want to eat a mouthful of dirt...
200.123
200.373
...he shouldn't have shown up
to school wearing a bow tie.
203.042
202.900
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
204.419
I've never even read a comic book.
You guys?
206.546

206.754
PENNY: Mm-mm.
207.255
# AMY
207.255
No.
207.755
# BERNADETTE
207.964
It's such an important part of their lives.
209.924
210.133
Maybe we should try reading some.
211.593
# AMY
211.593
Seriously?

The comic book store isn't far from here.

216.305
That is an amazing idea.
218.891

It is on.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
230.945
But the turn-by-turn voice option isn't on.
233.364
233.573
I know I'd feel more safe if you turn
on the turn-by-turn voice option.
236.868

I love the turn-by-turn voice option.

What did you do?
263.123
# SHELDON
263.123
I found a hack online.

Great idea. I haven't had

it's intelligently written...

I don't think it's heavy, I think it's some
