Would you pass the mustard?
4.677
# LEONARD
4.677
Sure.
5.678
6.054
Hey. Wanna hear a fun fact about mustard?
7.889
# SHELDON
8.097
Is it that the glucosinolates
which give mustard its flavor
10.600
10.767
were evolved by the cabbage family as
a chemical defense against caterpillars?
14.229
# LEONARD
15.855
Yeah.
17.190
17.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
18.816
Well, that was fun. Good for you, Leonard.
20.902
20.700
**LOL**
22.195
Hey there.
22.966
# LEONARD
22.966
Hey, you're early.
23.738
23.905
The movie doesn't start for an hour.
25.240
# HOWARD
25.323
Actually, we're not going to the movies.
27.575
27.742
We are here to kidnap you.
30.119
# LEONARD
30.453
What are you talking about?
31.533
# RAJ
31.663
Well, you eloped and we didn't get
a chance to throw you a bachelor party,
34.749
34.916
so there's a van downstairs
36.334
36.501
and we're here to take you
to a surprise location for the weekend.
39.963
# SHELDON
40.630
Well, I'd hardly call this kidnapping.
42.465
42.632
Where's the blindfold?
Where's the duct tape?
44.467
44.900
**LOL**
45.760
Where's the part where you call me
and demand ransom
47.804
47.971
and I try to keep you on the phone but
you hang up seconds before I can trace it
51.224
51.391
and then I say,
"I'm getting too old for this crud"?
54.269
54.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
57.438
When do we leave?
58.815
58.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
59.482
Right now.
60.400
# RAJ
60.400
Yeah, Penny packed you a bag.
61.317
# HOWARD
61.484
Wow, okay.
62.777
# SHELDON
63.152
You're seriously going to get in a van
and let these two take you
65.405
65.488
to an unknown destination
for an entire weekend?
67.657
# RAJ
67.824
Oh, not just him, you're coming, too.
69.617
# SHELDON
69.826
Oh, and how do you think
you're going to get me to do that?
72.161
# SHELDON
72.370
Unhand me! This is ridiculous!
74.330
74.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
74.497
I told you to put tape on his mouth.
76.333
# RAJ
76.416
And I told you he bit me.
78.084
105.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
106.613
It's bad enough
I'm being taken against my will.
109.073
109.407
I don't see why it has to be
in some hippie's mobile sex dungeon.
112.493
112.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
114.370
Well, Sheldon,
there's something about this van
116.497
116.664
that you're going to find
very interesting.
118.875
# SHELDON
119.334
What? It runs on syphilis?
121.044
121.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
122.837
This van was owned and driven by
your personal physics hero,
127.175
127.383
Richard Feynman.
128.843
# SHELDON
130.053
No.
130.553
# HOWARD
130.553
HOWARD: Yeah.
131.054
131.220
A buddy of mine let me borrow it.
133.013
132.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
133.013
This was Feynman's van? That's so cool.
134.807
# RAJ
134.974
Yeah, nothing's been changed
since he drove it.
137.101
136.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
137.268
I bet he picked up a lot of
cute grad students in this bad boy.
139.896
# SHELDON
140.146
Yeah, and talked about physics with them.
142.649
143.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
144.484
So, are you gonna give us a clue
where we're headed?
146.903
# RAJ
147.320
Uh, okay. Let's see.
149.072
149.800
**LOL**
149.364
They've got spicy food
and there's a chance you'll get diarrhea.
152.909
153.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
154.869
India.
156.037
# RAJ
157.955
We can drive there.
159.207
# LEONARD
159.374
Your house?
160.750
161.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
162.877
We are going to Mexico!
164.712
# LEONARD
164.879
Fun, I've never been there.
166.673
# SHELDON
166.839
Leonard, don't be fooled. I'm from Texas.
"Me-he-co" is Spanish for Mexico.
172.178
172.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
173.596
What's wrong with Mexico?
174.972
# SHELDON
175.139
Uh, mariachi bands, wild dogs, beans that
jump around 'cause there's a worm inside.

**LOL**
# HOWARD
181.396
Okay, calm down.
There's a theme to this weekend.
183.815
184.273
We are going to Mexico in Feynman's van
to stay at the vacation house
188.945
189.112
Feynman bought
with the money from his Nobel Prize.
191.781
# SHELDON
192.448
[Viva Ia Imodium!
194.784
195.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
198.496
Come on. Leonard's doing bachelor stuff.
200.456
200.623
You sure we can't take you
to a strip club?
202.303
# PENNY
202.458
No, if I wanna see a naked dancing man
204.627
204.836
I just flush the toilet
while Leonard's in the shower.
207.396
207.600
**LOL**
211.300
Hi.
211.800
# PENNY
211.800
Hey.
212.301
# AMY
213.052
I know we're not making a fuss, but,
215.138
215.304
in the spirit of bachelorette parties,
217.390
217.557
I made cookies
in the shape of male genitals.
220.518
221.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
222.812
You really didn't have to--
Whoa!
224.814
225.700
**LOL**
227.108
That is anatomic.
228.609
# AMY
229.485
Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.

236.451
Oh, look, Jewish and gentile.
238.911
239.400
**LOL**
# AMY
241.330
I had extra dough.
242.832
243.000
**LOL**
245.668
Oh, that's Leonard.
He said they're about to cross the border.
248.108
# BERNADETTE
248.337
I hope the boys don't get too crazy
in Mexico.
250.173
# PENNY
250.548
Oh, yeah, right, lock up your daughters
252.341
252.508
or Sheldon might lecture them about
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
256.095
256.500
**LOL**
# AMY
257.722
Boy, that was a long night for me.
259.766
262.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
263.186
Uh-oh.
264.187
264.353
According to this Mexican Customs website,
266.773
266.939
visitors may not bring more than
five laser discs, 20 compact discs
271.402
271.569
or 12 VHS tapes.
273.362
274.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
275.156
We don't have any of those.
277.325
# SHELDON
277.700
How can you be sure?
279.076
279.243
Uh, VHS was king when
Feynman drove this van.
282.038
282.500
**LOL**
282.205
And for all we know,
there are hidden compartments
283.957
284.040
lousy with Jane Fonda workout videos.
286.250
286.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
287.919
If there was a hidden compartment,
289.295
289.462
don't you think
you'd be stuffed in it by now?
291.464
291.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
293.800
Are we all up-to-date
on our Yellow Fever inoculations?
296.552
297.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
297.386
You don't need a Yellow Fever shot
to go to Mexico.
299.847
# SHELDON
300.097
You can never be too careful.
301.599
301.849
I got one last year
before I went to Epcot.

304.600
**LOL**
# AMY
307.730
So, Penny, how's married life?
309.482
# PENNY
309.732
Oh, it's good.
310.733
310.900
Just wish Leonard
would work up the courage
312.569
312.652
to tell Sheldon he's moving in here.
314.445
# BERNADETTE
315.071
You guys still aren't living together?
316.591
# PENNY
316.823
We are, I mean, he sleeps here,
318.741
318.908
but it's only a matter of time
before Sheldon has a bad dream
321.327
321.494
and tries to climb into bed
with the Leonard-shaped pile of pillows.
324.705
324.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
326.958
Speaking of Sheldon,
how's single life treating you?
329.168
# AMY
329.669
Fine, I guess. I've been focusing on me.
332.421
332.922
I was thinking about
changing my wardrobe.
334.549
# PENNY
334.632
Yes!
335.299
# BERNADETTE
335.299
Good for you!
335.967
336.900
**LOL**
# AMY
337.760
But then I decided
I don't wanna go changing who I am
340.096
340.263
just because of some man.
341.722
# PENNY
342.014
Yes.
342.640
# BERNADETTE
342.640
Good for you.
343.266

# PENNY
345.268
You know, it is normal to wanna change
your look after a breakup.
348.604
# AMY
348.980
Actually, I was thinking
of making one small change.
351.274
# BERNADETTE
351.440
Your sweater?
351.982
# PENNY
351.982
Your glasses?
352.525
# BERNADETTE
352.608
Your hair?
353.234
# PENNY
353.234
Your shoes?
353.860
354.200
**LOL**
# AMY
355.319
Piercing my ears.
356.654
# PENNY
356.946
Oh...
357.947
# BERNADETTE
358.155
You really never had that done?
359.407
# AMY
359.574
My mom said pierced ears were for whores,
pirates and genies.
362.994
364.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
366.205
Okay. Well, you're a grown woman now.
367.707
# AMY
367.874
I know, but Sheldon had this clause
in the relationship agreement
371.460
371.627
forbidding cosmetic surgery
unless it's to look like a Klingon.
374.672
375.100
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
377.133
We'll take you to the mall to get it done.
378.760
# PENNY
378.843
Why? I can do it right here.
380.219
# AMY
380.553
Really? You have a piercing gun?
381.429
# PENNY
381.429
PENNY: No.
382.305
382.388
All you need is a needle and an ice cube.
I've done it like a dozen times.
385.308
# AMY
385.933
Oh, I don't know.
387.268
# PENNY
387.268
Oh, come on. I'll be gentle.
388.603
388.769
Let me take your ear virginity.
390.521

I hear Mexican police target tourists.
401.240
# HOWARD
401.490
Oh, not a problem. If anything goes down,
403.743
403.910
we just put Koothrappali
in the driver's seat
405.703
405.870
and slap a sombrero on his head.
407.538

# RAJ
409.165
Dude, how many races
can you offend in a single breath?

I don't know.
Have you watched the Olympics with me?
415.171
416.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
417.131
Sheldon, can you believe that
we're driving in a van that was owned
419.592
419.675
by one of the greatest scientific minds
of the twentieth century?
422.678
420.700
**LOL**
422.845
It's like the Batmobile.
424.680
425.097
If Batman was real.
426.307
426.974
And a physicist. And his car wasn't cool.
429.185
430.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
431.103
It is extraordinary.
432.355
# RAJ
433.189
Perhaps some of his mojo
will rub off on us.
435.816
435.983
Maybe between this and his beach house,
we'll be inspired to greatness.
439.612
437.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
439.862
I usually don't put too much stock
in charms and talismans,
443.240
441.900
**LOL**
443.407
however even I must admit feeling Richard
Feynman's butt dent cupping my own bottom.
448.579
445.300
**LOL**
448.700
**LOL**
450.164
That does get the creative juices flowing.

454.085
Hey, I have to return this van.
Keep your creative juices in your pants.
458.089
458.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
460.174
What was that?
461.467
# HOWARD
461.467
I think it's a tire.
462.760
# SHELDON
463.052
What if it's bandidos shooting at us?
464.720
465.200
**LOL**
465.388
What if we get kidnapped?
466.889
467.056
What if we end up in a factory
468.256
468.391
making Bart Simpson pinatas
for the rest of our lives?
471.268
471.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
472.561
It's the tire.
473.938

476.149
# LEONARD
476.149
What?
477.066
# SHELDON
477.233
I'm getting too old for this crud.
479.193

# BERNADETTE
483.239
Amy, I noticed your status still says
"in a relationship" on Facebook.
486.742
# AMY
487.576
You're right. I should probably let
all of my Facebook friends know.
490.913
492.289
Penny, I'm no longer in a relationship.
494.500
495.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
496.669
Did you change yours to "married" yet?
498.189
# PENNY
498.796
Uh, no, not yet. There's still
a few people I haven't told personally.
501.799
# AMY
502.508
Who?
504.072
# PENNY
504.072
Oh, just my parents and my entire family.
505.636
506.500
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
507.388
What?
507.972
# AMY
507.972
Why?
508.556
# PENNY
508.723
Well, I don't wanna hurt my dad.
510.099
510.266
You know, he always wanted to dance
with his daughter at her wedding.
513.185
# BERNADETTE
513.352
What about your sister's wedding?
514.672
# PENNY
514.812
They started to but then her water broke.
517.314
517.700
**LOL**
518.649
You know, if he finds out we eloped,
that's gonna break his heart.
521.944
# AMY
522.111
How long do you think
you can keep it from him?
524.030
# BERNADETTE
524.196
Yeah, isn't it gonna get worse
the longer you wait?
526.532
# PENNY
526.699
Well, not necessarily.
You know, Dad's not getting any younger.
529.660
529.827
So if I wait long enough,
531.328
531.495
I'll just tell him he walked me
down the aisle and it was magical.
534.540
535.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
539.920
When did you learn how to change a tire?
541.589
# HOWARD
542.256
Every self-respecting gentleman
should know how,
544.675
544.925
in case he comes across a damsel
in distress by the side of the road.
548.095
# SHELDON
549.430
If I see one scorpion, I'm getting on
someone's shoulders and never coming down.
553.309
# LEONARD
554.060
And there's your damsel.
555.311
555.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
557.855
Wow, this one's really stuck.
560.232
# RAJ
560.566
Are you turning it the right way?
562.151
# HOWARD
562.818
No, I took the other four off
and when I got to this one, I thought,
565.821
565.988
"I'm in a rut, let's shake things up."
568.032
568.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
568.824
Here, let me try.
570.409

591.180
Nice.

Boy, if my mom could see me now,
she'd lock me in the sin closet.
597.186

**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
600.314
That's a joke, right?
601.649

Actually, the joke was on her, I could
still see the TV through the slats.
605.111
605.700

I'm starting to see why you and your mom
aren't very close.
609.657

Bet she'd still tell her
if she got married.

Well, it's kind of sad

Fine, you want me to call, I'll call.

Why am I so nervous?
623.566
# BERNADETTE
623.566
It's understandable.
625.256
625.714
Amy was afraid to tell her mom
she broke up with Sheldon.
627.954
# PENNY
628.217
Yeah. How did it go? Did she make you
crawl into the breaking-up drawer?
631.637
632.200
**LOL**
# AMY
633.556
Uh, well, actually, to be honest,
I haven't told her yet.
636.725
# PENNY
637.518
You've been giving me a hard time
638.811
638.894
and you haven't even told
your mom about Sheldon?
640.814
# AMY
641.522
I'm feeling a little dizzy
from all the blood loss.
643.149

I don't know what you're talking about.
644.792

**LOL**
# PENNY
647.278
Fine. I'm calling home, but when I'm clone,
you're calling your mother.
650.322
# AMY

Easy for you to say. You never had
to watch 60 Minutes like this.

Ah, she took your brother

Okay. I'll talk to her later.
674.263
674.346
Uh, Dad, there's something
I need to tell you.
676.146
677.099
Leonard and I got married.
679.185
680.019
You did? When?
681.604
# PENNY
681.770
Last week.
I'm sorry, I should've told you.
683.397
683.480
It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.
684.899
685.065
I feel terrible.
Please don't be too disappointed.
687.401
688.611
Are you happy?
689.778
# PENNY
689.945
Very. Leonard is so great.
691.780
692.573
Well, then, I'm happy for you.
693.949
# PENNY
694.408
Aw, thank you, Daddy. That means so much.
696.785
697.203
Well, I understand it's hard
to tell someone something
699.455
699.622
if you think it's gonna upset 'em.
701.415
# PENNY
701.874
It is. You're the best dad ever.
703.959
704.501
Yeah, uh, hold that thought.

Oh, you know that rototiller
I got for the tractor?
714.720
# PENNY
714.929
No.
715.909
715.909
Oh, you should see it.
716.889
717.306
It is a beautiful piece of machinery.
719.642
720.309
Anyway, uh...
721.852
722.478
I backed over your pet pig with it.

# PENNY

You killed my pig?

I did not kill him.
The vet took care of that.

Great. He's pushing with his uterus.

There's gotta be

780.244
# LEONARD
780.411
Yeah, this is nothing more
than a physics problem.
782.705
# SHELDON
783.038
Right. Archimedes once said,
785.374
785.541
"Give me a lever long enough
and a fulcrum on which to place it,
788.294
788.460
"and I shall move the world."
789.920
# RAJ
790.546
Of course, all we need is to find stuff
to make a lever big enough to fix this.
795.676
# HOWARD
795.843
Exactly. I'll bet there's something
around here that could be a lever.
799.388
# LEONARD
799.847
Let's see. A lever, a lever.
802.057
# SHELDON
802.224
Everybody hold on. Let's take this problem
one step at a time.
805.269
805.602
First, we need to decide whether
we're calling it "leever" or "lever."
809.189
809.400
**LOL**
811.400
And the sooner we decide it's "leever,"
the sooner we can roll up our sleeves
814.737
814.903
and not "slehves" and get to work.
817.114
817.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
818.407
We're gonna be here "for-eever."

What did we do?
825.977
# PENNY
825.977
Before I made that call,
826.874
827.041
my pig was alive and happy
and rolling around in the mud.
829.752
830.169
Now he's illegally buried in our backyard
next to my great-grandmother.
833.672
834.000

# BERNADETTE
836.175
Really? They didn't eat him?
837.634

No, he was a beloved member of the family.

never got along?

# PENNY

Okay. That's it, give me that.

she got her ears pierced

894.024
and she made us eat penis cookies.

Oh, it's too broad of a beam.

Ooh, the Green Lantern's ring could make
a big green hand that unscrews it.

932.187
Well, if you need a green hand,
why not just use the Hulk?

Oh, please. The Hulk would never get
across the border with that temper.

not that calling one of the Avengers

isn't a perfectly reasonable choice,
but we're scientists.

Don't you think we can figure this out
using actual science?

will corrode the lug nut off.
