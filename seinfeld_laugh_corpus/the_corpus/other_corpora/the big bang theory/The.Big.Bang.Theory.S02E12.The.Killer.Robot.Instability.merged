Howard, there's a
blond girl, Patsy, here to see you.
681.556
# HOWARD
681.932
Who?
682.975
683.141
MRS.
684.142
684.142
Okay, now she's saying it's Penny.
685.143
685.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
687.145
I don't wanna talk to her.
688.563
689.022
Hey.
689.857
# HOWARD
689.857
Ma.
690.691
690.857
MRS.
691.712
691.712
She ran past me.
692.567
692.734
Was I supposed to tackle her?
695.404
694.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
697.030
So I just came by
to see how you were doing.
700.200
# HOWARD
700.701
I'm fine.
702.619
# PENNY
702.786
Good.
704.371
704.871
Your mom seems nice.
706.290
# HOWARD
707.040
People move away from her on the bus.
710.210
709.900
**LOL**
712.087
What do you want?
713.130
# PENNY
714.423
Okay, look, Howard...
716.883
717.134
...l just want to apologize.
720.804
723.223
For some things that I have said.
725.809
727.200
**LOL**
728.186
About you.
729.396
730.200
**LOL**
731.857
I've been informed
that you have feelings...
734.318
735.000
**LOL**
737.404
...and apparently, I have hurt them.
739.531
740.100
**LOL**
740.991
So I'm sorry.
742.868
744.911
Howard.
746.496

**LOL**
# HOWARD
748.373
Fine. You're sorry. Goodbye.
751.752
# PENNY
751.918
So you're okay?
754.129
# HOWARD
754.296
Hey, I'm a big boy.
756.006
756.173
I'm not traumatized by some random
comment from some random woman.
760.635
760.802
I mean, get over yourself.
764.431
763.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
766.099
Okay. Well...
768.185
768.769

Oh, my God. That's Kripke's robot?
789.081
788.600
**LOL**
789.247
KRIPKE :
As you can see...
790.916
791.083
...the Crippler is reducing
the Chevy Cavalier to rubble.
794.044

**LOL**
# RAJ

I can't watch anymore.
796.671
# LEONARD
796.838
Sheldon, we have to call it off.
798.256
# SHELDON
798.256
We don't have that option.
799.674
799.841
We've accepted the challenge.
We can't run away from a fight.
802.928
# LEONARD
803.095
Oh, please. We've spent our whole lives
running away from fights.
806.848
806.300
**LOL**
807.015
Personally, I can squeeze through
a hole in a fence half my size.
810.727
# SHELDON
810.894
Well, impressive as that may be,
Monte is not us.
814.106
814.272
Monte has no fear.
816.066
# RAJ
816.233
Sheldon, did we all
not just watch the same video?
818.485
818.652
Kripke's robot just had angry sex
with a mid-sized automobile.
822.781
822.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
823.490
You are overlooking the fact
we know what we're up against.
826.159
826.326
And we can modify Monte
so that he's prepared.
828.620
# LEONARD
828.787
You wanna prepare him?
829.830
829.996
Install a bladder and a pair of shorts
so he can wet himself.
833.375
833.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
834.501
How are we gonna make
any modifications without Wolowitz?
837.254
837.796
Have you heard from Penny?
838.630
# LEONARD
838.630
Not yet.
839.464
# SHELDON
839.631
Have faith, gentlemen.
840.924
841.091
We don't need Wolowitz.
842.175
842.342
Engineering is merely
the slow younger brother of physics.
846.430
846.596
Watch and learn.
849.141
848.800
**LOL**

Do either of you know
how to open the toolbox?
855.230

# HOWARD
858.233
And then when I was 14...
860.610
861.100
**LOL**
861.778
...l met Marcy Grossman.
863.989
864.156
She was so beautiful.
866.199
866.366
She just got her braces off...
869.619
869.786
...but they left a little of the overbite.
872.873
873.165
It was so hot.
875.333
875.400
**LOL**
876.585
Like a sexy little chipmunk.
879.379
879.000
**LOL**
883.884
I didn't have the courage
to ask her out...
886.720
886.887
...but I dedicated a song to her
at the ninth-grade talent show.
892.058
# PENNY
892.684
Aw, that sounds sweet.
893.768
# HOWARD
893.935
Marcy Grossman is sunshine
897.439
896.700
**LOL**
897.606
On a cloudy day
900.984
901.151
When it's cold outside
904.863
905.030
Marcy Grossman is the month of May
907.699

**LOL**
# PENNY
907.866
Oh, it's cute.
908.909
# HOWARD
909.075
I guess you'd say
913.538
913.705
What can make me feel this way?
918.001
917.300
**LOL**
918.168
Marcy Grossman, Marcy Grossman
Marcy Grossman
921.505
921.671

# HOWARD
929.387
And then she came up
with that sexy little chipmunk mouth...
933.808
933.975
...and spit in my hair.
936.228
935.600

# PENNY
943.610
Howard, do you think
maybe sometimes...
946.363
946.530
...you try too hard?
948.448
# HOWARD
950.659
Look at me.
952.536
952.702
What chance do I have
if I don't try too hard?
956.248
# PENNY
957.457
Well, you have a terrific chance.
960.335
960.502
You're smart, you're funny,
you have a cool job.
962.712
962.879
You build stuff that goes into outer space.
964.673
# HOWARD
964.673
I guess.
966.466
# PENNY
966.633
No, look, I've known you
for a year and a half...
968.927
969.094
...and this is the first time
I feel like I'm talking to a real person.
973.139
973.306
And you know what? I like him.
975.350
975.934
He's a nice guy.
978.186
# HOWARD
978.645
You really think so?
980.146
# PENNY
980.313
Yes.

982.232
I don't know.
984.067

1008.341
# KRIPKE
1008.508
Yep. At 3400 rpm.

It can cut through steel

1022.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1022.272
No, Leonard.
1023.523
1023.690
For years, merciless thugs like Kripke have
made my life a series of painful noogies...
1028.236
1028.403
...and humiliating wedgies
and the insensitively named Indian burns.
1032.907
1033.000

# RAJ
1035.514
Sheldon, we don't have a chance.
1036.828
1036.995
The only improvement
you were able to make...
1039.080
1039.247
...was to put fresh batteries
in the remote.
1041.499
1042.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1041.958
What you fail to realize is Kripke suffers
from a fatal
1045.211
1045.378
Overconfidence from his robot's
massive size and its overwhelming power.
1049.758
# RAJ
1049.924
That's not overconfidence.
That's observation.
1052.802
1052.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1052.969
Trust me, Kripke will fall easy prey
to my psychological warfare. Observe.

1059.309
Kripke.
1061.019
1060.600
**LOL**
1061.936
I would ask if your robot
is prepared to meet its maker...
1064.606
1064.773
...but as you are its maker,
clearly the two of you have met.
1067.817

Are you crazy?

The street has no rules.

He's right, Leonard.
The paradigm is to the death.

# KRIPKE
1092.884
I will, however, give you the opportunity
to concede my superiority now...
1096.930
1097.097
...and offer me your robot
as the spoils of war.
1100.517
1100.400

1101.101
Never. I'd rather see Monte dead

I did this.
1159.576
