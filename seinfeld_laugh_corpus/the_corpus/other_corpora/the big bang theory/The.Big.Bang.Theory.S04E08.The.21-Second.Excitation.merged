I can't believe you've never seen

And I can't believe you've never read
Eat, Pray, Love.

When she comes out with Eat, Pray, Run
Away From a Giant Boulder, I'll read it.
38.664

I don't care if Eat, Pray, Love,
changed your life, I'm not reading it.

That's the work of noted Hollywood
costume designer Deborah Nadoolman.
51.510
51.719
She designed the red and black jacket
in Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video...
55.848
56.015
...which I've never viewed
in its entirety...
58.225
58.392
...as I find zombies dancing
in synchronicity implausible.
61.437
63.814
And also, it's really scary.

# HOWARD

Penny,
you should come with us Friday...
76.535
76.702
...to see it on the big screen
at the Colonial.
78.996
# PENNY
79.163
I'm watching it now.
Why would I wanna see it again?
81.666
# SHELDON
81.832
Because the print they're showing...
83.584
83.751
...has an additional 21 seconds
of previously unseen footage.
87.797
# PENNY
88.005
Wha-- Twenty-one seconds?
That'll be like seeing a whole new movie.
91.884
91.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
92.510
Exactly. They say it finally solves
the submarine controversy.
95.596
# SHELDON
96.138
Leonard, I'm no expert, but I believe
what we just heard from Penny...
100.101
100.267
...was sarcasm.
102.478
103.200

102.687
Oh, good. I'm 8-for-26 this month.
105.898

# PENNY
107.775
Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys
enjoy your extra 21 seconds.
111.320
# LEONARD
111.487
If I could make you understand why this
is a cool thing, we'd still be together.
115.324

115.533
Hmm... Yeah. No, we wouldn't.
118.536
118.900

Uh-huh. I'm guessing 21 seconds
had something to do with that too.

Relax, it's 5:00.
The movie doesn't start till midnight.
162.872
163.000

163.914
Another way of saying that is: the movie
starts at midnight and it's already 5:00.

# HOWARD
168.878
If we miss it, we'll have the fun of

190.691

...to see the premiere
of Star
192.026
192.026

# LEONARD
193.402
Oh, well, he waited in line for 14 hours
while you napped in a lawn chair...
197.615
197.782
...he got in a fight
when he stepped out of line to pee...
200.576
200.743
...and you wouldn't wake up
to vouch for him.
203.037
203.204
And worst of all,
he saw Star
204.663
204.663
Nemesis.

We should enjoy our meal, arrive late...

assuming we get in at all.

Under normal circumstances
I'd say I told you so...

...but as I have told you so with such
vehemence and frequency already...
362.947

You know what I really love

His chest hair.

Listen to what
Mr. Wil Wheaton is
695.028
695.237
"Best seats in house

Why do you read his Twitter feed?
It's only gonna upset you.

I believe in knowing my enemy, Leonard.
Had Twitter existed at the time...
710.043
710.210
...would not General Custer
have followed the tweets of Sitting Bull?
713.630
713.839
Would not Lee have followed Grant?
Would not Spy have followed Spy?
718.719

**LOL**
720.387
I have more examples, but excuse me.
Hello?
724.266
724.933
Well, this seems like an odd time
to test my cell-phone quality, but go on.
729.646
730.147
Test phrases? All right.
732.149
733.525
"I'm a toat".
735.569
735.736
"Al but".
737.738
736.900
**LOL**
737.904
"Twad".
739.740

All together? "I'm a total butt wad."

I'm not sure I grasp the full

All right. To what temperature
must you heat beef...
778.945
779.112
...in order to kill the prion that causes
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy?
783.241

Um...

Remember, you have to answer honestly.
786.995

No, Amy, you're supposed to ask her
something personal or embarrassing.

Oh, the gall. I hope his next tweet is:

"Popcorn lodged in trachea.

Sorry, fire regulations.
Should have gotten here earlier.

# SHELDON
828.954
This is nothing but a blatant abuse
of power by a petty functionary.
832.666
832.833
Explain to me why Wil Wheaton
and his lackeys get in and we don't.
836.878
# THEATRESTAFF
837.462
Because I'm the petty functionary
with a clipboard, bitch.
840.674

"The Miller's Tale" by Chaucer
is the dirtiest story I know.
898.440
899.300

It would've been hidden
in sock drawers...
901.610

...if people in the 14th century
had worn socks.

# BERNADETTE

I thought it was pretty spicy.
907.365

Especially the part
where he kisses her "nether ye."
911.536
911.300
**LOL**
# AMY
911.745
You might not like it as much
if you knew what "nether ye" meant.
914.831
915.040
Hint, if one cares about hygiene,
one ought not be kissing it.
919.127

# BERNADETTE

Okay, my turn. Penny, truth or dare?
923.924
# PENNY
924.090
Truth.
925.592
# BERNADETTE
925.759
Why are you still hanging out with
Leonard even though you broke up?
929.054
# AMY
929.221
Oh, that's an excellent question.
For two people no longer pair-bonded...
932.724
932.891
...you spend an inordinate
amount of time in each other's company.
936.228
# BERNADETTE
936.728
Yeah.
938.355
938.600

**LOL**
# PENNY
950.283
Look, just because we're not
seeing each other anymore...
952.953
953.119
...doesn't mean we can't be friends.
I mean, Leonard's a great guy.
956.456
# AMY
956.623
Then why did you terminate
your relationship with him?
959.251
# PENNY
959.417
I don't know. He got really serious
and I wasn't ready for it.
963.255
# AMY
963.421
How will you react if, in the future...
965.298
965.465
...you become ready for it
and Leonard is unavailable...
968.301
968.468
...because another woman has realized
he is, to use your words, "A great guy?"
973.098
# PENNY
974.266
You can only ask one question.
976.643

That one.

We should try to take her mind off it...

# BERNADETTE
1095.115

The Internet suggests
that slumber party guests...

experimentation with lesbianism.
