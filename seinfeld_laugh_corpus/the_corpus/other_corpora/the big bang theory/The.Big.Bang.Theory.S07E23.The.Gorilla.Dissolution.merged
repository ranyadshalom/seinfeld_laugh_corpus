Ah, very good.
124.547

Because a gorilla go-go dancer
of any sexual preference

would be out of place in a film
about the Holocaust.

Bernie, she's gonna be off her feet

Are you prepared to feed her,

I would do it for my mother.

Look, I'm not crazy about the idea,

We get a nurse. Preferably someone
from a third world country

Wouldn't you be upset if you saw

Can't happen. We have an ironclad

which precludes her from physical
contact with anyone other than me.

Leonard, you are really
not cheering me up.
634.098
# LEONARD
634.265
Come on. How can you be sad
when you're going home
636.600
636.767
with all five-foot-six of this?
639.937
639.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
640.729
You think you're five-foot-six,
that's funny.
642.857
643.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
647.027
I don't understand it.
648.487
648.654
I'm a nice guy, I have a great job,
650.865
651.031
I'm well-educated,
come from a good family...
654.201
654.368
Why don't women want to be with me?
656.036
# SHELDON
657.246
An interesting question.
659.373
660.791
Well... good night.
663.127
664.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
664.378
What? Don't send me home.
I can't be alone right now.
668.382
# SHELDON
668.549
That's your problem.
You can't be alone.
671.427
# RAJ
671.594
What do you mean?
672.887
# SHELDON
675.306
How many women
have you had dates with?
677.308
# RAJ
678.934
Eleven.
679.935
# SHELDON
680.102
How many of those women did you think
would become your perfect companion?
684.148
# RAJ
686.025
Eleven.
687.651
687.200
**LOL**
687.818
Wait. Do I count the 200-pound
Sailor Moon girl
690.529
690.696
that Howard and I had
a threesome with at Comic-Con?
693.324
693.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
696.619
Sure.
697.995
697.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
699.163
I'll stick with 11.
She liked Howard better.
702.291
701.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
704.627
Well, now do you see the problem?
706.503
# RAJ
708.130
Maybe. I...
I don't know.
711.050
711.217
It's late, I... I should...
I should go.
713.886
718.599
Look, I do get what you're saying.
720.643
720.809
Instead of desperately clinging
to any woman who will go outwith me,
723.729
723.896
I need to work
on my fear of being alone.
726.065
# SHELDON
727.441
I was trying to suggest
chemical castration, but...
729.860
731.100
**LOL**
733.155
...it's my bedtime, so whatever
gets you out the door. Good night.

# BERNADETTE

742.206
# HOWARD
743.249
I just got her to sleep.
744.500
# BERNADETTE
744.667
Sorry.
745.793
# HOWARD
745.960
What took you so long?
The grocery store's a few blocks away.
748.504
# BERNADETTE
748.671
They only had regular yogurt.
I had to go to a different store
751.007
751.090
to get the extra-fat kind
your mom likes.
753.592
753.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
754.760
Then why do I smell coffee
on your breath?
756.762
# BERNADETTE
756.929
So what? After two days
of taking care of her,
759.390
759.556
excuse me for stopping
to get a mocha.
761.475
# HOWARD
761.642
A mocha?
Well, it must be nice to be queen.
765.646
766.300
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
766.647
Queen?
I've been killing myself here!
769.066
# HOWARD
769.233
Well, whose fault is that? I wanted
to get a nurse, but you were all,
771.194
771.277
"I'm nice. I want to take care of people."
774.029
773.900
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
776.323
I'm glad I got that mocha.
And you know what else I'm glad about?
779.702
779.868
I bought you a brownie
and I ate it in the car!
783.747
784.100

Thanks a lot.
Now I have to go rub her belly again.

Hey.
801.599
# EMILY
801.599
Thanks for letting me come over.
802.641
# RAJ
802.808
Of course.
Please, come in.
805.185
# EMILY
807.396
I just wanted to say how sorry
I am about tonight, and...
810.983
811.400
...I want to make sure that we're okay.
813.193
# RAJ
814.028
Look, you and I haven't made
any commitments to each other.
816.572
# EMILY
816.739
I know.
I just felt like I needed to explain.
819.616
819.783
The guy I was
with did my last tattoo,
821.327
821.493
and he's been
asking me out for months.
823.370
823.537
I finally said yes
just to get it over with.
825.914
# RAJ
826.081
It's okay.
827.144
# EMILY
827.144
Really?
828.208
# RAJ
828.375
Well, I mean, yeah,
it freaked me out a little,
830.919
831.086
but that's my issue, not yours.
833.464
# EMILY
834.423
Wow.
835.924
836.091
If I saw you outwith another woman,
I'd be pretty upset.
838.927
# RAJ
839.094
Thank you.
840.596
841.500
**LOL**
843.057
Not just for being upset,
but for believing that could happen.
846.310
847.100
**LOL**
# EMILY
849.938
Just so you know,
I'm not seeing anyone else.
852.399
# RAJ
853.275
Well, me neither.
854.568
# EMILY
855.277
Okay.
856.070
# RAJ
856.070
Okay.
856.862
857.696
Please.
858.739
858.906
So, you... You have tattoos?
860.803
# EMILY
860.803
Yeah.
862.701
# RAJ
862.868
I don't.
864.453
864.500
**LOL**
865.371
I have a hole in my belly button that
may or may not have been a piercing.
868.791
869.200
**LOL**
# EMILY
869.833
That's cool.
871.334
# RAJ
871.334
It's a piercing.
872.836
872.900
**LOL**
874.713
So... how many tattoos?
876.590
# EMILY
877.633
One on my shoulder,
one not on my shoulder
880.219
880.386
and one really not on my shoulder.
883.472
# RAJ
886.100
It's, uh... been a long time
since I've seen a girl's...
889.520
890.020
...really not her shoulder.
892.022
891.800
**LOL**
# EMILY
894.191
Well...
895.150
895.651
...how about you show me
your piercing
897.653
897.820
and I show you my tattoos?
899.655
# RAJ
906.537
But before I take my shirt off,
I just need, like,
908.622
908.664
ten minutes to do some crunches.
910.416
911.100

I need to start
making some smart decisions.

Like what?
933.439
# PENNY
934.356
I don't know.
935.691
937.109
We could get married.
938.444

Come on, be serious.
940.341
# PENNY
940.341
I am.
941.363

942.448
Why?
Because I'm a "smart decision"?
945.826
# PENNY
945.993
Well, yeah.
946.994
# LEONARD
948.245
So, I'm like a bran muffin.
950.831
951.800

952.166
What, no, that's not what I'm saying.
954.293
# LEONARD
954.460
No, it's exactly what you're saying.
I'm the boring thing
956.420
956.503
you're choosing
because I'm good for you.
958.505
# PENNY
958.672
What does it matter?
The point is, I'm choosing you.
960.883
# LEONARD
961.049
Well, it matters a lot.
I don't want to be a bran muffin.
963.510
964.300
**LOL**
964.428
I want to be a...
Cinnabon, you know?
967.473
967.900
**LOL**
968.640
A strawberry Pop-Tart.
970.851
971.200
**LOL**
972.102
Something you're excited about even
though it could give you diabetes.
975.564
975.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
977.232
Sweetie, you can be
any pastry you want.
979.151
# LEONARD
979.318
No, no. No, it's too late.
I'm your bran muffin.
982.237
982.404
Probably fat-free
and good for your colon.
985.199
985.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
986.617
You know what? Forget it.
I never should've brought it up.
988.898
# LEONARD
989.578
You know I want to marry you,
but you're only doing this
992.539
992.706
because you got fired
and you're feeling sorry for yourself.
994.917
# PENNY
995.000
Okay, it may look that way,
but getting fired
996.877
997.044
from that movie was the best thing
that could have happened to me, okay.
999.338
999.421
I finally realize
I don't need to be famous
1001.298
1001.465
or have some big career to be happy.
1003.217
# LEONARD
1003.383
