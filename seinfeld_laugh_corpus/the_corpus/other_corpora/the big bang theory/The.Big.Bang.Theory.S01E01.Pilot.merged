If a photon is directed through a plane with
two slits in it and either is observed...
6.215
6.382
...it will not go through both.
If unobserved, it will.
8.926
9.093
If it's observed after it left the plane,
before it hits its target...
12.346
12.513
...it will not have gone through both slits.

Agreed.

There's no point, I just think
it's a good idea for a T-shirt.

No. We are committing genetic fraud.
95.554

There's no guarantee our sperm's
going to generate high-IQ offspring.

Think about that.

There's some poor woman

What if she winds up with a toddler
who doesn't know if he should use...
120.454

404.363
...with a little string theory doodling
around the edges. That part's just a joke.

At least I didn't have to invent 26

In winter, that seat is close enough
to the radiator to remain warm...
469.511
469.678
...yet not so close
as to cause perspiration.
471.889
472.056
In the summer, it's in a cross breeze
created by opening windows there and there.
476.268
476.435
It faces the television at an angle that is
neither direct, discouraging conversation...
480.522
480.689
...nor so far wide
as to create a parallax distortion.

Yeah. It's like regular Boggle,

I'm a Sagittarius, which probably tells you
way more than you need to know.

# SHELDON
557.057
Yes, it tells us that you participate
in the mass cultural delusion...

560.686
...that the sun's position relative
to arbitrary constellations...

somehow affects your personality.

Participate in the what?

# LEONARD
571.321
I think what Sheldon's trying to say...

...is that Sagittarius wouldn't have been
our first guess.

Anyways, I'm also writing a screenplay.
610.402
610.569
It's about this sensitive girl who comes
to L.A. from Lincoln, Nebraska...
613.989
614.156
...to be an actress and winds up
a waitress at The Cheesecake Factory.
618.368

Okay, let's see, what else?
631.673

I guess that's about it.
634.843

That's the story of Penny.

# LEONARD
638.222
Well, it sounds wonderful.
639.806
# PENNY
640.933
It was.
642.351
642.517
Until I fell in love with a jerk.

What is happening?

652.861
Oh, God, you know,
four years I lived with him.
655.113

Four years.
That's like as long as high school.

No, it's not crazy. It's a
691.608
691.775
It's a paradox.
693.485
693.652
Paradoxes are part of nature.
I mean, think about light.
697.030
697.197
If you look at Huygens, light is a wave, as
confirmed by the double-slit experiments.
701.785
701.952
But then, along comes Albert Einstein...
704.288
704.454
...and discovers that light
behaves like particles too.
707.416
710.043
Well, I didn't make it worse.

That's not true.
Remember at Thanksgiving...

had that episode?

Point taken. It has been some time since
we've had a woman take her clothes off...

...after which
we didn't wanna rip our eyes out.
765.098

The worst part
was watching her carve that turkey.

are you trying to accomplish here?

That woman in there
is not going to have sex with you.

Oh, good.
Then you won't be disappointed.

What makes you think
she wouldn't have sex with me?

I'm a male and she's a female.

Yes, but not of the same species.

I'm not gonna engage
in hypotheticals here.

# SHELDON

Oh, of course.

797.381
That's not to say that
if a carnal relationship were to develop...
800.467

804.429
However briefly.

Do you think this possibility
will be hindered...

# LEONARD

Must we?
955.851
# SHELDON
955.851
Event A:
956.456
956.623
A beautiful woman
stands naked in our shower.
958.708
958.875
Event B: We drive halfway across town
to retrieve a television set...
962.212
962.379
...from the aforementioned woman's
ex-boyfriend.
964.589
964.756
On what plane of existence
is there even a semi-rational link...
968.343
968.510
...between these events?
970.554
971.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
971.263
She asked me to do her a favor, Sheldon.
973.598
# SHELDON
973.765
Well, that may be the proximal cause
of our journey...
976.226
976.393
...but we both know it exists
in contradistinction...
978.812
978.979
...to the higher-level distal cause.
980.939
# LEONARD
981.106
Which is?
982.524
# SHELDON
982.524
You think with your penis.

That's a biological impossibility,
and you didn't have to come.

Oh, yes. I could have stayed behind
to watch Wolowitz hit on Penny...

991.157
...in Russian, Arabic and Farsi.

There's some dispute
between Penny and her ex-boyfriend...
1016.683
1016.850
...as to who gets custody of the TV.
1018.518
1018.685

Anyway, I've learned my lesson.
She's out of my league, I'm done with her.

I've got my work.

One day I'll win the Nobel Prize
and then I'll die alone.

# SHELDON
1202.994
Don't think like that.
You're not going to die alone.

# LEONARD
1206.206
Thank you, Sheldon.
You're a good friend.
1209.209
# SHELDON
1210.335
And you're certainly
not gonna win a Nobel Prize.

This is one of my favorite places
to kick back after a quest.

1223.848
1224.098
His name is Buttons.
1226.017
1226.000
**LOL**
1226.559
Anyway, if you had
your own game character...
1228.645
1228.812
...we could hang out,
maybe go on a quest.
1231.731
# PENNY
1231.898
That sounds interesting.
1233.545
# HOWARD
1233.545
So you'll think about it?
1235.193
# PENNY
1235.360
Oh, I don't think
I'll be able to stop thinking about it.

# PENNY
1245.182
Oh, my God. What happened?
1246.621
# LEONARD
1246.788
Well, your ex-boyfriend sends his regards and
I think the rest is fairly self-explanatory.
1252.418
1251.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
1252.585
I'm so sorry.
1253.753
1253.920
I really thought if you guys went
instead of me he wouldn't be such an ass.
1257.382
# LEONARD
1257.549
No, it was a valid hypothesis.
1259.133
# SHELDON
1259.300
That was a valid hypo--?
What is happening to you?
1262.554
1262.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
1263.096
Really, thank you so much
for going and trying.
1266.182
1266.349
You just-- You're so terrific.
1269.894
1269.700
**LOL**
1271.563
Why don't you put some clothes on, I'll
get my purse, and dinner is on me, okay?
1275.275
# LEONARD
1275.441
Really? Great.
1276.025
# SHELDON
1276.025
Thank you.
1276.609
1276.776
Okay.

You're not done with her, are you?

Is Thai food okay with you, Penny?
1300.842
# PENNY
1300.842
Sure.
1301.801
# SHELDON
1301.968
We can't have Thai,
we had Indian for lunch.
1303.970
# PENNY
1304.137
So?
1305.347
# SHELDON
1305.347
They're both curry-based cuisines.
1306.556
# PENNY
1306.723
So?
1308.079
# SHELDON
1308.079
It would be gastronomically redundant.
1309.434
1309.601
I can see we're going to have to
spell out everything for this girl.
1313.021

Turn left on Lake Street
and head up to Colorado.

Oh, that sounds like fun.

Baby, baby, don't get hooked on me
