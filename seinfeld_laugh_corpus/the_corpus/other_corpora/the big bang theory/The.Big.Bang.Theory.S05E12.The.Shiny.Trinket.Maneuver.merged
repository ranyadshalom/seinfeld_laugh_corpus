A man pops out for a moment

...and catch up on the adventures
of the Caped Crusader only to emerge...
38.164

This is how you're going to entertain

A magic show is an inherently

If we poison the critical thinking
faculties of children...
86.713

rabbits come out of hats...
89.090
89.257
...then we create adults who believe
in astrology and homeopathy...
93.177
93.344
...and Ryan Reynolds was a
better choice for Green Lantern...

Don't be so hard on him, it's natural

My most recent paper on how

So are we ready to order?

# AMY
263.973
Give me a minute.
I'm gonna go wash up.
266.726
# SHELDON
268.060
Well, that's odd.
We both washed up when we came in.
272.064

It's probably a euphemism
for urination.

Sheldon, what is wrong with you?
277.111

Not much.

Although I can be faulted
for being overly fond of koala bears.

# SHELDON
292.668
Oh! I see why you're confused. No.
294.670
294.837
Her news sounded important,
but what you're forgetting is...
297.715
297.882
...it was an achievement
in the field of biology.
300.426
300.593
That's all about yucky squishy things.

**LOL**
# PENNY
304.889
All right, honey, she's upset.
You're her boyfriend.
307.433
307.600
You have to at least try to be excited
by the things she's excited by.
311.479
# SHELDON
311.646
What if they simply don't excite me?
314.086

Well, just smile and think about koalas.

She'd see right through that.
We go to the zoo all the time.

one of her old bathing suits.

It's called the dove pan. You let
everyone see the pan is empty...
423.507
423.674
...but there's a secret
compartment in the lid.
427.303

# BERNADETTE
757.800
I'm sorry. I know it makes me
sound like a bad person...
760.469
760.636
...but I just don't like children.
762.554
# HOWARD
762.554
Yeah, no, we all got that.
764.473
765.300
**LOL**
766.934
But don't you think it'll be
different when the child is ours?
770.938
# BERNADETTE
771.146
Right. When it's our kid that's ruined
my body, kept me up all night...
774.608
773.300
**LOL**
774.775
...and I've got no career, no future,
nothing to be happy about for 20 years.
778.570
778.737
Sure, that'll be completely different.
781.323
781.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
784.827
Well, yeah.
786.620
786.800

**LOL**
# SHELDON
791.917
I don't think there's anything
in this jewelry store...
794.545
794.712
...that Amy would appreciate more than
the humidifier we're looking at at Sears.
799.800
799.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
800.843
Oh, my God. Now I know what I sound
like to you when I say stupid stuff.
805.180
804.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
807.766
Ooh! A pocket watch.
809.893
# PENNY
810.060
I don't think Amy
wants a pocket watch.
811.937
# SHELDON
812.104
No, but maybe she wants
a man with a pocket watch.
816.066
815.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
816.233
Still saying stupid stuff.
819.236
819.300
**LOL**
821.238
Does she like bracelets?
822.927
# SHELDON
822.927
Well, she's very fond of her silver one...
824.616
824.783
...that says "allergic to penicillin."
827.453
827.619
Maybe they have
a dressier version of that.
829.788
830.000
**LOL**
# ASSISTANT
829.997
How are we doing this afternoon?
Looking for anything special?
833.125
833.334
Perhaps a ring for the lady?
834.710
# PENNY
836.086
Trust me, we are not a couple.
837.286
837.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
837.755
Excuse me. I don't see why
you get to snort derisively...
840.799
840.966
...and point that out.
You'd be lucky to land a fellow like me.
844.595
844.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
844.803
Fine. Go ahead.
846.138
# SHELDON
847.514
Trust me, we are not a couple.
849.016
849.300
**LOL**
# ASSISTANT
850.768
My apologies.
How can I help you today?
852.603
# PENNY
852.811
He's in trouble with his girlfriend,
needs a present.
855.439
# ASSISTANT
855.647
Great. Trouble with girlfriends is what's
putting my daughter through U.S.C.
861.153
861.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
863.739
Ooh!
864.865
865.032
Are those real diamonds?
865.887
# ASSISTANT
865.887
Yes.
866.742
866.909
Channel-set baguettes,
20 points total weight.
869.286
# SHELDON
869.495
Remarkable. Diamonds.
Crystallized carbon.
873.123
873.290
Every day, people go to the grocery
store and come home with sacks...
876.627
876.794
...full of carbon in the form
of charcoal briquettes...
879.421
879.588
...they toss in their barbecues
and set on fire.
882.174
882.341
But just because you've got some
carbon with the atoms stacked neatly...
886.053
886.220
...you expect me to plunk down
thousands of dollars.
888.889
# ASSISTANT
889.098
Actually, that's only 750.
Everything's on sale.
891.809
# SHELDON
892.017
Really? Talk to me
about that pocket watch.
894.144
894.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
898.524
I'm still trying to wrap
my mind around it.
901.026
901.193
I always thought
I'd be a dad someday.
904.655
# RAJ
904.863
Me too. You're so caring.
907.324
907.491
I've often pictured you guiding
a young boy into manhood.
910.536
910.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
915.541
There you go, Howard. Sounds like Raj'll
have your babies. Problem solved.
919.670
919.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
919.878
Because a man
shows caring for another man...
922.047
922.214
...doesn't mean he's displaying the love
that dare not speak its name.
925.884
925.500
**LOL**
928.429
Did she say she didn't want kids?
930.097
# HOWARD
930.305
Yeah. She doesn't like them.
932.349
932.516
And from what I saw,
the feeling was mutual.
935.227
935.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
941.108
What are you gonna do?
942.150
# HOWARD
942.150
I don't know.
943.193
943.360
I can't see a life where I don't have kids.
I mean, people have kids.
947.573
947.781
I mean, even Donkey Kong
had Donkey Kong Jr.
952.411
953.000
**LOL**
953.829
So he could teach someone
how to kidnap princesses...
957.207
957.374
...and throw barrels
at Italian plumbers.
960.335
961.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
962.504
You know, there's no guarantee even if
you have kids you're gonna like them.
966.175
# RAJ
966.383
Wow, that's rough.
Where'd you get that?
969.011
969.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
970.888
It's right off the dust jacket
of my mom's last book.
973.432
973.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
977.478
Maybe me and Bernadette
aren't right for each other.
980.105
# LEONARD
981.732
Look, Howard, I'd say
there's a lot of fish in the sea...
984.443
984.610
...but I watched you dangle your hook
for years.
987.279
987.446
Do not throw her back.
989.531
989.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
992.951
I don't want to,
but this is kind of a deal breaker.
996.538
# RAJ
996.705
What will your mom say
if you call off the wedding?
998.749
# HOWARD
998.916
Heh, it'll kill her.
If I don't give her grandchildren...
1002.002
1002.169
...that'll kill her too. So either way
on the Morn front, I'm golden.
1006.048
1008.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1009.718
What time did you tell Amy to be here?
1011.407
# PENNY
1011.407
Eight o'clock.
1013.096
1015.700
**LOL**
1018.810
That pocket watch is ridiculous.
1020.187
# SHELDON
1020.187
Nonsense.
1021.563
1021.730
I look like a train conductor.
1023.857
1023.900
**LOL**
1027.277
Under what pretext
did you lure her here?
1029.571
# PENNY
1030.572
I said, "Hey, wanna come
over and hang out?"
1032.824
# SHELDON
1032.991
Good, good. If you'd said something clever,
she might've gotten suspicious.
1036.620
1036.200
**LOL**
# AMY
1038.038
Hey.
1038.664

Hi.

# AMY
1040.123
What's he doing here?
1041.521
# PENNY
1041.521
Okay, he wants to talk to you.
1042.918
# AMY
1043.085
Well, I don't wanna talk to him.
And I'm pretty disappointed in you too.
1046.797
1046.964
Although we both know
that won't last.
1049.550
1049.400

Thank you.
1053.929
1054.137
Amy, I'd like to apologize.
1057.015
1057.224
Your accomplishment was impressive,
and I'm proud of you.
1061.311
1063.000
**LOL**
# AMY
1065.774
We both know that's your koala face.
1066.963
# SHELDON
1066.963
I told you.
1068.151
1067.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
1069.945
Okay, look. He bought you this.
1071.905
# AMY
1073.198
Jewelry? Seriously?
1075.784
1075.993
Sheldon, you are the most shallow,
self-centered person I have ever met.
1079.580
1079.746
You think another
transparently manipulative
1082.124
1082.291
Oh, it's a tiara!
1083.875
1084.100
**LOL**
1084.042
A tiara. I have a tiara. Put it on me,
put it on me, put it on me...
1088.005
1088.213
...put it on me, put it on me,
put it on me.
1090.299
1091.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
1093.844
You look beautiful.
1095.512
# AMY
1095.721
Of course I do.
I'm a princess and this is my tiara.

Here's your vest back.
1124.019
# HOWARD
1124.019
You should keep it.
1125.250
1125.417
You could wear it again sometime.
1126.814
# BERNADETTE
1126.814
Where?
1128.211
# HOWARD
1128.962
I don't know, hunting?
1130.547
1131.200

Don't forget to talk to her
about this meshugas...
1135.177

...where I don't get grandkids.
1137.095

# HOWARD
1139.222
: Don't worry, Ma, I will,
as soon as I can figure out...
1141.975
1142.142
...a way to bring up
such a sensitive issue.
1144.519
1145.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
1149.483
Guess you talked to your mom.
: I was upset.
1152.069
# HOWARD
1152.235
My mom can be
a pretty good shoulder to cry on...
1155.030
1155.197
...if the smell of Bengay
doesn't burn your eyes.
1158.116
1158.500
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
1159.743
Look, it's obvious having kids
is really important to you...
1163.121
1163.288
...and I think I came up
with a solution.
1165.332
# HOWARD
1165.540
Really? That's great. What?
1168.919
# BERNADETTE
1169.086
Well, seeing as how I make
way more money than you anyway...
1172.339
1172.547
...what if I work
and you stay home with the kids?
1175.342
# HOWARD
1176.468
Me?
1177.010
# BERNADETTE
1177.010
Yeah.
1177.552
1177.761
You know, you'll watch Barney
and pull Cheerios out of their noses...
1181.306
1181.515
...and go on play dates and I'll work
and have conversations...
1184.685
1184.851
...with people my own age
and enjoy my life.
1187.354

# BERNADETTE
1200.158
I don't know if this counted as a fight...
1202.244
1202.411
