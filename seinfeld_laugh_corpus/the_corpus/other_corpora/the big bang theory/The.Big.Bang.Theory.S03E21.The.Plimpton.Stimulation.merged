Do you have allergies?

No.

Too much pepper on your salad?

I don't put pepper on salads.

I've heard enough. Sit over there.

Oh, Leonard, I have something for you.
33.326
33.492
Per our roommate agreement,
this is your 24-hour notice...
36.621
36.787
...that I will be having
a non-related female...
39.081
39.248
...spending two nights
in our apartment.
41.792

# LEONARD

When you say non-related female,
you still mean human, right?
47.923
47.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
48.132
Well, of course.
49.175
49.342
Pets are banned by the agreement,
with the exception of service animals...
52.887
53.054
...such as Seeing Eye dogs
and, one day...
55.056
55.222
...cybernetically enhanced
helper monkeys.

Are you planning

77.203
77.370
...please address your comments to me
through a napkin.
80.456
80.100
**LOL**
80.623
We've been corresponding for years
about our mutual interest...
84.001
84.210
...in gravitational wave signatures
of inflatons in the early universe.
87.630
87.797
Now she's under consideration
for a position at our university.

# LEONARD
91.342
Why didn't you tell me
you knew Elizabeth Plimpton?
93.803
93.969
I am a huge fan of hers.
96.013
# SHELDON
96.180
I didn't realize I had to share
my connection...
98.474

You enjoy Canadian bacon.
I've been to Toronto.

# HOWARD
118.327

# SHELDON
124.041
A, I rarely kid.
125.418

by my use of the word "buzzinga."
130.005

130.631
So you're saying the two of you are
going to be sleeping in the same bed?

Why is a renowned scientist staying
in our apartment instead of a hotel?
149.400
# SHELDON
149.608
She doesn't care for hotels.
And who can blame her?
152.069
152.236
Windows that don't open,
multi-user linens...
154.905
155.114
...keys shaped like credit cards.
156.741
156.907
As if one walks around
with unassigned slots in one's wallet.
159.827
159.900
**LOL**
160.411
All right, I believe I have time
for one more question.
163.122

166.000
When can I sit with you again?
168.002

**LOL**
# SHELDON
168.169
When I've seen two negative
throat cultures spaced 12 hours apart.

You know the drill.

173.500

173.340
All right, if you'll excuse me...

I can't believe he's friends

261.929
262.096

No, no, no, I'm not flabbergasted.

that I'd written it on my hand.

what I'd written on my other hand...

...which are the coordinates
for a neutron star.

Elizabeth, can I get you something?
413.706
413.872
Perhaps a feminine-hygiene product
or a bowel-regulating yogurt?

418.200
**LOL**
# ELIZABETH
418.585
Interesting choices.
419.628

They had very little in common
except for carnal activity.

But it's been a while, and I wanted
to sound smart over breakfast.

Sure.

657.282
657.449
...we start to see
a possible explanation...
659.534
660.200

Oh, Penny, this is Dr. Plimpton,
a leading expert on quantum cosmology.
786.370
786.578
Dr. Plimpton, Penny is a waitress
who doesn't understand...

You and Sheldon and Sheldon's friend,
Dr. Plimpton, who you just met.
822.406
