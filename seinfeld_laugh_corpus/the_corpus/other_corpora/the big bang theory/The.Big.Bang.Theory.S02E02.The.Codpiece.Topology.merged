Please let it go, Sheldon.

It was rife with historical inaccuracies.
13.598
13.764
For example, the tavern girl
serving flagons of mead.
16.267
16.434
Now, her costume
was obviously Germanic...
18.728
18.894
...but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws,
or Reinheitsgebot...
23.107
20.100
**LOL**
23.274
...severely limited the availability
of mead.
25.693
24.500
**LOL**
25.860
At best,
they would've had some spiced wine.
27.862
# LEONARD
28.029
You're nitpicking.
29.322

# SHELDON
29.322
Oh, really?
30.615
30.781
Well, here's another nit for you.
32.325
32.491
The flagons would not have been made
of polypropylene.
35.620
36.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
35.786
Renaissance fairs
aren't about historical accuracy.
38.831
38.998
They're about taking chubby girls
who work at Kinko's...
41.584
41.751
...and lacing them up
in corsets so tight...
43.753
43.919
...their bosom jumps out
and says, "Howdy."
46.881
46.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
47.673
Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy,"
in the 15th century.
50.301
50.468
If anything,
they would've said, "Huzzah."
52.720
52.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
52.887
I don't care what the bosoms say,
Sheldon.
54.889
55.056
I just wanna be part of the conversation.

Hi, guys.
59.727
59.894
Looks like you've been
to the Renaissance fair.

# SHELDON

More of a medieval-slash-

any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.

It wasn't awkward.

It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?
107.274
105.800

We dated, we stopped dating,
and now we're both moving on.
110.861
# RAJ
111.028
By "moving on," you mean
she's going out with other men...
113.698
113.864
...and you spend the afternoon
making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?
117.993
117.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
118.452
That was not 15th-century soap.
120.121
120.287
My god, those people need to learn
you can't just put "ye olde"...
123.332
123.499
...in front of anything you want
and expect to get away with it.
126.460

Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.

# SHELDON
131.716
You're wearing modern underwear?
133.634

134.301
Relatively modern.
136.387
136.200
**LOL**
137.555
What are you wearing?
138.639
# SHELDON
138.806
I fashioned historically accurate
undergarments out of linen.
142.768
142.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
142.935
You went and bought linen?
144.270
# SHELDON
144.437
Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.
147.648
147.700

150.151
Borrowed?

**LOL**
# LEONARD
176.343
You know,
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.
178.345
178.512
It gives me freedom to move on myself.
180.347
# HOWARD
180.514
Are you saying
that you've been holding back?
183.684
183.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
184.560
Of course. Out of respect.
187.062
# HOWARD
187.229
So how do you explain
the 10 years before Penny?
191.358
191.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
192.151
Who were you respecting then?
194.403
# LEONARD
194.862
What? I've dated plenty of women.
197.156
197.323
There was, uh, Joyce Kim,
Leslie Winkle...

Notify the editors

210.961
What about that girl last year
at Comic-Con?
212.963

It doesn't count.
213.964

You're only saying that
because of what happened.

What happened to you?
222.702
# RAJ
222.702
Nothing happened to me.

224.308
It wasn't your fault, Raj.

He was dressed
as a green Orion slave girl.

# RAJ
230.564
How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.
233.067
233.234
Dude, you have totally not moved on.
234.882
# LEONARD
234.882
Yes, I have.
236.529
235.500
**LOL**
236.695
It's just a matter
of actually making a date with someone.
239.949
# HOWARD
240.115
Like who?
241.971
# LEONARD
241.971
Well, there's Joyce Kim.
243.828
243.994
But she defected back to North Korea...
247.414
247.400
**LOL**
247.873
...so it's a little
geographically undesirable.
250.501
250.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
250.668
What about Leslie Winkle?
252.419
# SHELDON
252.419
Oh, no.
254.171
254.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
254.338
Why?
255.548
# SHELDON
255.548
Her research methodology is sloppy...
256.757
256.924
...she's unjustifiably arrogant
about loop quantum gravity...
259.760
259.927
...and to make matters worse,
she's often mean to me.
263.138
262.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
264.056
I think she's smoking hot.
265.161
# HOWARD
265.161
I'd hit that.
266.267

You'd hit particulate soil

**LOL**
# LEONARD
275.025
Look, I like Leslie,
but she's not interested in dating...
277.695
277.862
...as much as using men as tools
for stress release.
280.447
# HOWARD
280.614
Yeah? So? Be a tool.
283.117
283.200
**LOL**
284.034
Go get yourself
a little rebound stress release.
287.454

It would only be rebound if he and Penny
had actually engaged in physical intimacy.

I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.

339.548

...I'm going to go do work
that promises significant results...
343.177

367.534

...like blue ice
falling out of an airplane lavatory.

Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an "LOL."

Anyway, it got me thinking.

Now that you're unattached, maybe
we can revisit our previous attachment.

No, I'm all done with casual sex.

398.065
# LEONARD
398.232
Really? What changed?
399.233
# LESLIE
399.733
There's just a time
in every woman's life...
401.735
401.902
...when she gets tired of waking up
on a futon...
404.196
404.363
...with a bunch of people
she doesn't know.
406.615
406.500

# LEONARD
407.408
Yeah, I can see how that would--
A bunch of people?
410.911
410.400
**LOL**
# LESLIE
411.078
Anyway, I just figure
it's time to slow things down...
413.580

...and who better to slow things down with
than you?

I'm flattered.

# LESLIE
423.590
Your place. We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.
427.094
427.261
Then light petting, no coitus.
429.263

**LOL**

Sounds fun.
432.308
# LESLIE

I'll leave the details up to you.

Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.

Well, you can't blame me
for not jumping to that conclusion.
489.490

Why? What's so unusual

495.475
All right, all right.

496.955
Nevertheless, I have one now...

...and I'd appreciate it if you would,
you know, make yourself scarce.

How much scarcer could I be?

You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?

I know it is.

Oh. Oh, well, good for him.

Please. The only way she could make
a contribution to science...

Okay, well, I have a date too,

Me too. You're sure you're okay
postponing intercourse...

No problem.
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.

I guess I'll call you

I believe protocol dictates
that you wait a minimum of 18 hours...

by your cloying eagerness.

the old community-college try.

Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're Leonard's friend...
1022.105
1022.272
...you will support him
no matter who he wants to be with.
1025.358
# SHELDON

Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?
1028.862
1029.000

1029.529
If Leonard's really my friend...
1031.031

in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
1034.701

I will graciously overlook the fact...
1088.129
1088.296
...that she is an arrogant,
subpar scientist...

1090.882
...who believes loop quantum gravity
better unites quantum mechanics...
1094.177
1094.344
...with general relativity
than does string theory.

Okay, well,
there is a lot of merit to both theories.
