I can't get the damn key out.

That's not surprising.
54.639

That Baldwin lock on your door uses
traditional edge-mounted cylinders...
58.184
58.351
...whereas the key for your Volkswagen
uses a center-cylinder system.

# PENNY
72.490
I'll tell you why.
Today I had an audition.
74.575
74.742
It took me two hours to get there.
I waited an hour for my turn.
77.662
77.828
Before I could start, they told me
I look too Midwest for the part.
80.998
81.165
Too Midwest.
What the hell does that even mean?
83.376
# SHELDON
83.542
The American Midwest was mostly settled
by Scandinavian and Germanic peoples...

Haven't gotten a raise at work.

130.360
I did.

He said he'll get here when he gets here.

You're frustrated because he phrased
his reply in a meaningless tautology?

No. I am frustrated
because I am a failure at everything...

Well, yes, but you're the one
who said hello to her when she moved in.

I did. I told her. I texted her.

739.573
I sent out a very emphatic Twitter.

Um, sometimes people, good people,

They find themselves, through no fault

That's not what she's doing, Leslie.
