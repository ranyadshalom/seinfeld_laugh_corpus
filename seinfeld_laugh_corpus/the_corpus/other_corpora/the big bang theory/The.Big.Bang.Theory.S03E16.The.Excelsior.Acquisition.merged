What? I'm giving myself
dramatic entrance music.
27.486
27.653
People will know I'm awesome
and to be feared.
31.240
30.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
31.407
Right. There's nothing more awesome
and frightening...
33.993
34.160
...than a man who's got music blasting
from between his nipples.
38.122

# LEONARD

Hey, Stuart. What's going on?
40.958
# STUART
40.958
Well, you might wanna mark...
42.418
42.585
...your Google calendars. Stan Lee
is coming to do a signing on Thursday.
46.547
# SHELDON
46.714
Did he finally write a sequel
to his autobiography?
49.258
49.425
I'm sure ages 79 through 87
were just action-packed.
53.220
52.700
**LOL**
# STUART
53.387
No, just a regular comic signing.
55.765
55.931
My uncle is his dermatologist,
and Stan's doing him a favor.
59.518
# SHELDON
59.685
Oh, I don't wanna know that.
61.687
62.000
**LOL**
61.854
How can I possibly discuss with
Stan Lee the scientific foundations...
65.316
65.483
...for interstellar flight on a surfboard
when part of my brain...
68.653
68.819
...will be scanning his face
for signs of contagious skin disease?
72.865
71.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
73.532
Stan Lee does not have
a contagious skin disease.
76.786
# SHELDON
76.952
Well, look who thinks
he's Stuart's uncle now.
80.289
79.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
80.956
Can't believe it.
We're gonna meet Stan Lee.
84.460
85.900
**LOL**
87.129
I'm so excited
And I just can't hide it
89.131
89.900
**LOL**
90.966
I'm about to lose control
And I think I like it
93.344
# HOWARD
93.511
I'm sad to say
I taught him those moves.
95.971
123.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
124.667
I can't decide whether I want Stan Lee
to autograph...
127.253
127.420
...my Journey Into Mystery 83,
first appearance of Thor...
130.297
130.464
...or my Fantastic Four Number 5,
first appearance of Dr. Doom.

# SHELDON
154.321
I've decided I'm going to have Mr. Lee
sign my copy of this month's Batman.
158.701
# HOWARD
159.034
That's crazy. Stan Lee
had nothing to do with Batman.
161.954
# SHELDON
162.121
Which is why no one else
will ask him to sign one.
164.498
164.665
I'll be the possessor of a unique,
albeit confusing artifact...
167.668
167.835
...which will set me apart from
the hoi polloi of comic-book fandom.
171.672
171.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
172.757
That's a great idea. I'm gonna get him
to sign a Batman as well.
176.552
176.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
178.512
What is it about the word "unique"
you don't understand?
181.557
# HOWARD
181.724
Ow! Damn. Paper cut.
Nothing worse than a paper cut.
184.643
# RAJ
184.810
Well, obviously,
you don't remember your circumcision.
188.689
188.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
190.357
There's Neosporin and Band-Aids
in my top desk drawer.
193.402
# HOWARD
193.569
Why don't you keep that stuff
in the bathroom?
195.905
# LEONARD
196.071
He does. And in the kitchen,
and in the car, and in his pocket.
199.658
# SHELDON
199.825
Yeah, but the ones in my pocket
are mine.

Guess who's gonna be
at the comic store on Thursday.
207.708
# PENNY
207.875
Um, can you give me a hint?
209.376
# LEONARD
209.376
Stan Lee.
210.878
210.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
211.045
Urn, Stanley. Stanley. Stanley Tucci?
215.174
215.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
215.341
No, ha, ha. No. Stan Lee.
219.011
# PENNY
219.178
Oh. Oh, Stan Lee. Cool.
222.890
224.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
225.643
You have no idea who he is, do you?
227.311
# PENNY
227.520
Of course I do.
You're an important part of my life...
230.231
230.397
...and I pay attention to the things
you are interested in.
233.609
233.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
233.776
Good. Good.
234.944
234.944
Heh, heh.
236.111
236.278
So who's Stan Lee?
237.363
# PENNY
238.280
Um, he was on Star Trek.
240.616
240.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
244.829
No.
245.371
# PENNY

246.080
No.
247.289

# PENNY
247.998
Um, Stan Lee. Oh, he was in those goofy
kung fu movies you love so much?
252.753
# LEONARD
253.128
That's Bruce Lee.
255.047
254.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
255.464
Oh.
256.507
256.674
So is this Bruce Lee's
nerdy brother, Stan?
259.260
260.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
260.803
Sheldon, why do you have all these
unopened paychecks in your desk?
264.807
# SHELDON
264.974
Because most of the things I'm planning
to buy haven't been invented yet.
269.436
268.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
269.937
There must be thousands
of dollars here.
272.147
272.314
Why don't you put it in the bank?
273.712
# SHELDON
273.712
I don't trust banks.
275.109
275.276
I believe that when the robots rise up,
ATMs will lead the charge.
279.738
280.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
281.115
You've also got something
from the Pasadena Municipal Court.
284.451
# SHELDON
284.785
Undoubtedly yet another snide response
to my repeated letters...
288.163
288.330
...complaining that the flags in front of
the courthouse are in the wrong order.
292.167
292.334
It's supposed to be federal, state,
and then city of Pasadena.
296.171
# PENNY
296.589
I'm sorry, you sent more than one letter
about that?
300.301
# SHELDON
301.135
It bothers me.
302.803
303.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
304.013
Sheldon, this is a summons.
305.764
# SHELDON
305.764
A summons? For what?
307.516
# HOWARD
307.683
Looks like you ran a red light...
309.393
309.602
...on Marengo Avenue at 9:30 p.m.
on November 16th.
314.481
314.857
They got you on a traffic camera.
Nice picture.
318.360
318.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
322.865
November 16th? Penny, that's
the evening you fell in your bathtub.
326.702
326.869
I had to drive you
to the emergency room.
328.954
# PENNY
329.121
No, it isn't.
330.331
330.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
331.206
Yes, it is.
332.437
# PENNY
332.437
No, it isn't.
333.667
# SHELDON
333.834
I have an eidetic memory. That's
a picture of you in the passenger seat...
337.379
337.546
...holding your dislocated shoulder.
339.965
# PENNY
340.132
Hmm. No, it isn't.
341.342
341.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
342.927
Okay, then why is a summons
for a traffic violation...
346.180
346.347
...committed in your car, bearing
your license plates, coming to me?
350.601
352.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
355.648
Okay, look, they sent me the ticket.
357.399
357.566
I told them I wasn't driving,
and they were all, "Who was it?"
361.236
# SHELDON
361.403
So you betrayed me.
362.404
# PENNY
362.404
No.
363.405
363.100
**LOL**
363.572
It wasn't a betrayal.
364.698
364.865
It was more of a, I can't afford
any more points on my license.
367.868
368.035
I already have to buy my insurance
from this place in the Cayman Islands.
371.705
371.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
371.872
But the only reason
I was driving your car...
374.041
374.208
...was because you were in distress,
and I was rescuing you.
377.169
# PENNY
377.336
Yes. And look, now you have a photo
to remember that heroic day.
381.048
381.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
382.591
It's not that big a deal.
384.093
384.259
You just go down to the court on Thursday,
and you pay the fine.
387.596
# SHELDON
387.763
I'm not going to pay a fine.
That would imply I'm guilty.
390.849
# HOWARD
391.016
You are guilty.
392.393
395.700
**LOL**
398.816
That one I liked.
400.046
# SHELDON
400.046
Yeah.
401.276
401.944
I am not guilty.
I only have a learner's permit.
404.279
404.446
Penny was the teacher.
When the light turned yellow...
406.907
407.074
...she said, "Go, go, go,"
so I went, went, went.
409.994
410.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
410.202
Sheldon, I'm sorry. I'll be happy
to reimburse you for the fine.
413.497
413.706
You know, as soon as I get a part
in a movie or my own TV series.
417.418
417.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
417.584
You don't need to reimburse me.
I'm not paying.
419.795
419.962
On Thursday, I will have my day in court,
and justice will be done.
423.924
424.091
In fact, I'm going to begin
preparing my defense right now.
427.511
# HOWARD
428.887
Okay, he's going to jail.

What do you mean "all"?
448.720
# SHELDON
448.720
Well, you're my friends.
450.117
450.284
You'll be standing by my side,
supporting me...
452.786
452.953
...feeding me legal precedents,
and, if you have the strength...
455.998
456.165
...carrying me out on your shoulders
when I'm victorious.

Uh, Stan Lee or you in court.

it would've been a much shorter movie. No.

485.527
All right, then,
my so-called friends have forsaken me.

So I guess it'll just be me
and my eyewitness.

Oh, balls.

Try to wear something appropriate.
It won't help my case if the judge...

scrawled across your buttocks.

525.359
I've taken the liberty of scripting

You're somewhat of a loose cannon.

Don't worry, it's written

Do I have a choice?
536.120

Of course you have a choice.

It is because of you
that I now have a criminal record.
