In that culture, the last morsel
is called the kreng jai piece.

Let's play a fun guessing game
to see who gets to take me.
78.413

All right. This four-letter word

First of all, they're not tricks.
They're illusions.

Secondly, when we get married,
they're all going up in the attic...
285.203

...so you can have that closet
for clothes.

It was billed as a lively give-and-take
on the merits of model-train sizes.
412.163
412.330
But it was actually a set-up...
413.831
413.998
...to intimidate weak-minded, spineless

# AMY

Would you like to dance?
703.245

703.454
No, thank you.
I'm really not much of a dancer.
706.665

You're not exactly winning any trophies
as a conversationalist, either.
711.587

# LEONARD
714.131
I'm sorry.
The bride and groom seem happy.
717.968
# AMY
718.594
Why shouldn't they be?
They have a feverish night...
721.138
720.100
**LOL**
721.305
...of socially-approved copulation
ahead of them.
724.308
724.500
**LOL**
725.643
In some cultures,
we'd stand outside their room...
728.020
728.187
...cheering as they achieved orgasm.
730.397
729.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
731.482
That sounds like a late night,
and I have work in the morning, so...
734.985

Leonard, you may not have noticed,

You're not holding up your end

I'm sorry.
This wedding just reminds me...
745.996
746.700
**LOL**
746.163
...of my kind-of-sort-of girlfriend
9000 miles away.
749.458
# AMY
749.625
I have a kind-of-sort-of boyfriend
playing with a model train right now.
752.465
752.586
You don't hear me bitching about it.
755.005
754.400
**LOL**
758.717
A word of advice.
Moody self-obsession is only attractive...
761.720
761.887
...in men who can play guitar
and are considerably taller than you.
765.307
765.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
765.516
I'm not moody, I'm fun.
768.310
# AMY
768.519
Do you have any evidence
to support that statement?
771.188
770.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
771.355
Well, hey,
I'm just as much fun as you are.
774.066
# AMY
774.233
Really?
Are you willing to draw a mustache...
776.443
776.610
...on your finger
as a conversational icebreaker?
779.405
779.571
lam.

# LEONARD

We just had a lovely meal.
790.541

The band is on fire.

794.628
And you're sitting next to a beautiful
woman wearing whorish makeup.
798.048
798.200
**LOL**
799.717
Why don't we head out on the floor...
801.593
801.760
...and see if I can sweat
through these dress shields?
804.430
804.000
**LOL**

804.930
Once again,
I'm really not much of a dancer.

# BERNADETTE
848.327
No. I need to brush my teeth...
849.641
849.808
...but your mother's been
in the bathroom for an hour.
852.561
# HOWARD
852.728
Oh, yeah, she sometimes
has problems doing her business.
855.439

Hang on, ahem.

MRS.
870.766
870.766
She can come in
and brush her teeth. I'm not embarrassed.

Problem solved.
875.334

No, it's not. I'm not going in there.

# HOWARD
880.255
Oh, come on, honey. She's just
sitting in there reading a magazine.
883.675
883.842
You can't see anything.
I go in all the time.

897.300
**LOL**
899.566
Wait here.
I'm gonna go light a candle.
902.152

And then we make passionate love.

# LEONARD
913.997
I just can't figure out what happened.
915.624
915.791
I put my left leg in,
I took my left leg out.
918.210
918.700
**LOL**
918.377
I put my left leg in,
and something just snapped.

I did have a great time.
928.011
928.178
Thank you for reminding me
it's okay to have fun once in a while.
931.598
# AMY
932.099
You're welcome.
933.183
# LEONARD
933.350
Also for breaking the head
off the ice swan...
935.227
935.394
...so I could hold it
against my pulled groin.
938.188
937.900
**LOL**
# AMY
938.522
I excel at spatial reasoning,
and I had a hunch...
940.691
940.858
...that the graceful slope of its neck
would cradle your genitals nicely.
944.361
944.800
**LOL**

945.988
Well, okay. Again, thank you.

Great. Until I accidentally made
Leonard fall in love with me.
973.974

# PENNY
977.811
Come in, let's talk.
979.813
979.300

980.814
Do you want a glass of wine?
982.316
# AMY
982.483
Wine is one of the reasons
I'm in this fix.
984.568
984.735
That and this dang pelvis.
986.069
986.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
988.822
Okay, I'm sorry,
what exactly happened?
991.033
# AMY
991.241
The inevitable. He was lonely and
vulnerable from missing his girlfriend.
994.786
994.953
While I was charming, supportive,
and let's face it...
997.372
997.539
...in this dress, the perfect combination
of Madonna and whore.
1001.168
1000.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
1002.044
Oh, God, did he make a move on you?
1004.150
# AMY
1004.150
No, but it's only a matter of time.
1006.256
1006.757
How could I have not seen this coming?
1008.717
1008.884
Now I'm gonna have to break
the little sad sack's heart.
1012.054
1011.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
1014.097
I'm sure he'll be okay.
1015.224
# AMY
1015.390
Oh, Penny.
Much as I would treasure knowing...
1017.190
1017.351
...the two of us had been defiled
by the same man...
1019.391
1019.520
...Leonard just doesn't get
my motor running.
1021.688
1021.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
1026.777
So, um, what are you gonna do?
Do you want me to talk to Leonard?
1029.696
1029.863
Let him down easy.
1031.407
# AMY
1031.407
No. I'll let him have tonight.
1032.950
1032.700
**LOL**
1033.700
I'll send him an e-mail...
1035.118
1035.285
...letting him know this body
is never gonna be his wonderland.
1038.288
1038.600
**LOL**
1040.165
I mean, frankly, you've got a better shot
than he does.

# SHELDON

Leonard, check it out.
1055.722
1055.889
I bought an N gage locomotive.
1057.891
1058.058
Half the size of HO.

I had a lot more fun with Amy
than I thought I would.

# SHELDON
1073.448
What do you mean by that?
1074.992
# LEONARD
1074.992
It turns out she really knows...
1076.535
1076.702
...how to help a guy loosen up
and have a good time.
1079.288
1079.454
Although, truth be told,
my groin's a little worse for wear.
1083.166
1084.251
Ow!
1085.794
1085.300
**LOL**
1089.214
Why'd you do that?
1090.194
# SHELDON
1090.194
To send a message.

She is not for you.
