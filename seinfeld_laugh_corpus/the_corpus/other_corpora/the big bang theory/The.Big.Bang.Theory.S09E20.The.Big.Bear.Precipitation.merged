It's nice to get back to nature.
6.888
7.055
Why don't I do this more often?
8.932
10.200
**LOL**
13.019
What a beautiful forest.
15.271
16.606
Hello, little butterfly. Mmm.
20.109
21.361
What's your name-- Oh!
23.112

**LOL**
# LEONARD
24.113
What you doin'?
25.532
# SHELDON
25.698
I was enjoying some virtual reality.
You ruined it with your actual face.
30.370
30.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
31.913
What am I smelling?
33.414
# SHELDON
33.581
It's car air freshener.
I was simulating the smell of the forest.
37.168
37.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
38.253
That's not what the forest smells like.
39.796
# SHELDON
39.879
Well, how would I know?
41.381
42.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
44.384
Why are you pretending
to be outdoors? You hate it.
46.469
# SHELDON
47.262
Oh, Amy showed me a compelling study
49.597
49.764
that demonstrated the cognitive benefit
of spending time in the wilderness.
52.892
# LEONARD
53.059
Buddy, I am ready to
drive you into the wilderness
55.019
55.186
anytime you want and leave you there.
56.688
57.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
57.897
Well, make your jokes,
59.399
59.566
but some of the participants who spent
four days in the woods,
62.151
62.318
away from all technology,
63.444
63.611
reported a 50% gain
in reasoning skills upon their return.
67.031
# PENNY
67.782
Okay, if that's true, why aren't there
more genius squirrels?
71.286

You may need this more than I do.

Here's your tea.
110.849

112.410
You don't sneak up on a guy
when he's sitting on a log.
115.455
115.800
**LOL**
# AMY
116.873
You know,
if you really wanna be in nature,
118.553
118.708
why don't we rent a cabin?
120.251
# SHELDON
120.418
I'm sorry, when did you even get here?
121.938
122.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
123.630
You know, there's a cabin in Big Bear
125.381
125.548
that a doctor I work with
keeps offering me.
127.259
# LEONARD
127.342
Because he's hitting on you?
128.462
# PENNY
128.593
She.
129.781
# LEONARD
129.781
Oh, good.
130.970
# PENNY
131.137
But I could get her.
132.430
133.000
**LOL**
# AMY
134.432
Look, we could all go for the weekend.
It'll be fun.
136.601

Yeah...  Excuse me.
138.186
140.300

Here, look up fun, get back to me.
144.901

# LEONARD
147.070
You and I could still go
and have a nice weekend.
148.655
# PENNY
148.738
Sure.
149.739
# AMY
149.906
Come on, Sheldon, let's go with them.
151.699
# SHELDON
151.866
I hardly think so.
153.284
153.451
But you be sure and say hello
to all the mosquitoes, bees, bears,
157.413
157.580
snakes, possums, poison oak
159.832
159.999
Oh, and last but not least,
teenagers with guitars.
163.586
164.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
165.797
I'll see if it's available.
167.256
# AMY
168.424
You know, if that study's real, Leonard
might come back smarter than you.
171.928
# SHELDON
172.095
Are you trying to manipulate me?
173.576
# AMY
173.576
Yes.
175.056
# SHELDON
175.223
Well done, it worked. We're going.

Yay!

182.063
# RAJ
182.230
No, no, you're pregnant.
183.648
184.107
The only thing you carry
is our hope for a better tomorrow.

**LOL**
# HOWARD
190.363
Hey, where you been?
191.572
# BERNADETTE
191.739
Ah, Raj took me to the baby doctor
and then we swung by the grocery store.
194.826
# HOWARD
194.992
Did you get graham crackers?
196.494
197.412
I mean...  ls the baby okay?
199.247
200.100
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
200.707
Yes and yes.
202.500
# HOWARD
203.459
I didn't know you needed help
running errands today.
205.628
# BERNADETTE
205.795
I didn't, but Raj volunteered.
207.046
# HOWARD
207.046
Really?
208.297
# BERNADETTE
208.464
Yeah, ever since
you told him I was pregnant,
209.883
209.966
he's really been making a fuss over me.
211.426
# HOWARD
211.509
Well, I guess that's kind of sweet.
213.886
# RAJ
214.470
Bernie, I just forwarded you
217.181
217.348
a list of the top five lactation
consultants in Los Angeles.
221.060
221.227
I know my favorite,
but I'd love to hear what you think.
224.188
224.600

And it just got weird.

Hey, Amy's downstairs.
233.051

Okay. One sec.
234.198
# PENNY
235.742
Uh, what... What you got goin' on here?
237.618
238.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
239.287
I bought a baseball cap.
240.705
# PENNY
241.539
I can see that. What team did you get?
243.583
# LEONARD
243.750
Uh, Hufflepuff from Harry Potter.
245.543
246.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
248.254
Well, we'll be in the woods.
249.630

I'm ready to go.

Nice hat, Sheldon.
258.931
# SHELDON
259.098
Thanks.

What the hell are you watching?

# BERNADETTE
279.118
Raj found all these
childbirth videos online.
282.288
282.455
This one is of a woman
giving birth in a river.
284.707
285.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
286.292
Okay, that is the least Jewish thing
I've ever seen in my life.
289.962
289.800
**LOL**
293.549
You feel like Raj is getting a little
carried away with all the baby stuff?
297.720
# BERNADETTE
297.887
I don't think so, he just wants to be
part of the experience.
300.640
# HOWARD
300.807
All right. If you say so.
What's in the box?
304.018
# BERNADETTE
304.185
It's an ultrasonic microphone
so we can hear the baby's heartbeat.
306.785
# HOWARD
306.938
Oh! That's cool. Can we try it?
310.566
# BERNADETTE
310.733
Well, actually, Raj ordered it.
312.527
312.693
He made me promise to wait
till he was here.
314.946
315.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
315.571
So he can be part of the experience?
318.491
# BERNADETTE
318.741
Yeah.
319.826
# HOWARD
319.992
Surprised he let us conceive without him.
322.036
322.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
324.205
It's a sore spot, don't bring it up.

It's so cute and rustic up here.
331.712
# LEONARD
331.879
I know, did you see they still have
a video rental place?
334.215
334.382
It's like Colonial Williamsburg.
336.175
336.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
338.010
Well, cell service is down to one bar,
341.556
341.722
so if anyone needs medical attention
344.016
344.183
or to tell a stranger their political
views are stupid, now's the time.

Have you ever been off the grid before?
350.439

Once. The battery ran out on my phone.
I had to wait for my iPad to turn on.
355.820

I was afraid he was gonna eat me.

# HOWARD
362.451
Raj just pulled up.
363.536
364.620
I'm gonna say something to him.
366.180
# BERNADETTE
366.330
Leave it alone. He means well.
368.291
# HOWARD
368.457
So, you don't think
he needs to rein it in a little?
371.252
# BERNADETTE
371.752
No, not really.
373.254
# HOWARD
373.921
You're not concerned he's acting like
somehow this is his kid, too?
377.758
# BERNADETTE
378.301
He's just trying to be supportive.
379.802
# HOWARD
379.969
Just supportive.
Not over-the-top in any way?
383.639
# BERNADETTE
384.098
No.

So nice of that doctor

# PENNY
409.165
Well, she is taking me
to an Indigo Girls concert,
411.375
411.542
so hold that thought.
412.919
413.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
415.671
Okay, well, should we
check each other for ticks?
420.092
420.800
**LOL**
# AMY
422.428
Sheldon, all we did
was walk in from the car.
426.015
# SHELDON
426.182
Oh, well, suit yourself.
Who wants to check me?
428.768
429.700

On the other hand, safety first.

Wow! It's really coming down.
444.617
# PENNY
444.784
Yeah, this sucks.
446.035
# LEONARD
446.202
And there goes our hike.
447.870
# SHELDON
448.037
Oh! Not our hike!
449.830
450.200

450.957
Now we have to stay safe and warm.
453.626
453.700

454.543
You know, we could still go.
A little rain isn't gonna kill us.
457.129
# LEONARD
457.296
Have you been outside in the rain
with Sheldon?
458.923
# PENNY
459.006
No.

# LEONARD
459.861
You'll wish it would kill you.
460.716
461.300
**LOL**
# AMY
463.469
So what do we do now?
464.637
# LEONARD
464.804
They have some board games.
466.055
# SHELDON
466.222
Yeah, most of the Jenga pieces are missing
and the Scrabble only has seven tiles.
470.601
470.768
So, unless you want to build
an unimpressive structure
472.937
473.104
with the word SNERPF next to it, move on.
475.940
475.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
476.107
Hey, let's light a fire.
477.692
# AMY
477.858
Ooh! That sounds cozy.
479.360
# LEONARD
479.527
I don't think I've lit a real fire before.
481.404
# SHELDON
481.570
It's basic thermodynamics.
I'm sure we could figure that out.
484.782
# LEONARD
484.949
I could stack the logs conically
to facilitate air flow.
488.077
# SHELDON
488.244
That would maximize oxygen
for optimal combustion.
490.705
# LEONARD
490.871
Right, so all we need is to
492.081
# PENNY
492.248
Got it.
493.416
493.700

# RAJ
519.442
I don't understand.
520.568
# HOWARD
521.027
The three of us aren't having this baby.

Thanks for understanding.

Of course.

We'll never win.

You always play the drinking game.
588.594

**LOL**
# PENNY
590.096
Not the drinking game, a drinking game.

To be fair, good at both.

What's the game?
596.686
# PENNY
596.686
All right.
597.270
597.353
It's called Never Have I Ever.
The rules are simple.
599.355
599.438
Someone says something they've never done,
600.940
601.023
but if you have done it, you take a drink.
602.703
# LEONARD
602.817
I've never played that before.
603.943
# SHELDON
604.026
Hey, now wait, have we started,
do I drink, what is happening?
606.779
607.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
608.197
Okay, just calm down, I'll go first.
609.824
610.574
All right, let's see. Never have I ever...
613.911
# AMY
614.995
She's trying to think of something
she's never done before,
617.373
617.540
this could take a while.

619.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
620.000
Very funny.
621.210
621.377
Okay, never have I ever...
622.962
624.880
Yeah, you know what,
let's just circle back.
626.600
627.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
627.716
Okay, I'll go.
Never have I ever been arrested.
630.678
# SHELDON
630.845
So I drink?
632.012
# AMY
632.179
No, it's only if you've done it.
633.889
# SHELDON
634.056
Got it.
635.224
637.300
**LOL**
# AMY

I can't believe you've been arrested.

Sheldon, what did you do?
646.902
# SHELDON
647.069
Well, I'm not proud of it,
but... I jaywalked.
651.031
# LEONARD

Oh, no, it's like a horror movie,
we're trapped in a cabin with a maniac!

**LOL**
# AMY
657.371
I'm surprised you would do that.
658.914
# SHELDON
659.081
No, I, I crossed in
the middle of the street.
660.916
661.083
And normally I wouldn't, but I saw
an aggressive looking girl scout and...
665.588
666.100
**LOL**
665.754
Yeah, it was the heart of cookie season.
668.340
668.507
Anyway, there was a police officer,
and he witnessed the whole thing.
672.011
669.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
672.178
What, he arrested you for that?
673.762
# SHELDON
673.929
Hmm? Uh, no, he didn't do anything.
675.306

So I said, "You just saw me jaywalk,
why aren't you doing your job? You know?
678.726
678.800
**LOL**
680.853
"Maybe I should arrest you
for, for impersonating a police officer."

Yeah.
696.076
# HOWARD
696.243
But on the other hand,
I didn't kick him out of our lives.
698.913
699.079
I just asked him to back off a little.
701.373
# BERNADETTE

Oh! I know.
781.120
781.287
Never have I ever kept
a secret bank account
784.623
784.790
because I think
my wife can't handle money.
787.710

799.430
# LEONARD
799.596
Yeah, I know. But this isn't a big deal.
801.598
801.765
It's just a little savings I put aside.
803.475
# PENNY
803.642
We're married.
We're supposed to share everything.
806.061
# LEONARD

What? You mean, like,
your massive credit card debt?

# RAJ
820.534
I appreciate the apology,
but it's really not necessary.
823.746
823.912
I overstepped my bounds.
825.331
# HOWARD
825.497
No, Raj. You've been great.
826.749
826.915
I just need to start doing my part
around here.

I hear that.

# RAJ
833.422
Well, if that's the case,
is there anything I can do to help?
836.008
# HOWARD
836.842
Well, not right now, but we could
try out that microphone you got us
839.720
839.887
and listen to the baby's heartbeat.
841.287
# RAJ
841.430
Really? 
It's okay if I listen with you?
844.099
# BERNADETTE
844.266
Of course.
845.434
# RAJ
845.601
Can I squirt the ultrasound jelly
on your stomach?

# HOWARD
850.898
Hey, look at that, it's weird again.

**LOL**
# LEONARD
858.530
Okay, you have every right to be mad.
860.574
860.741
And what you said is true,
you do make more money than me.
862.910
862.993
So I had no right to do what I did.
865.454
865.621
And I'm so sorry.
I hope you can forgive me.
867.664
# PENNY
868.123
How long have you had this secret account?
869.803
# LEONARD
869.958
A couple years, but I just put a few bucks
aside every month for emergencies.
874.421
# PENNY
874.588
Well, how much you got in there?
875.881
# LEONARD
876.048
$6,427,
878.384
878.550
$47 once my nana's
birthday check gets here.
881.804

# PENNY
883.305
My God, Leonard, do you know what
I could do with that kind of money?
885.725
# LEONARD
885.808
No, I do, and that's why I hid it.
887.810
888.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
890.312
What good is it if you don't use it?
892.106
# LEONARD
892.481
Uh, you have shoes you love
but never wear.
895.484
895.651
I have money I love but never spend.
897.028
897.111
We're kind of a cute couple that way.
899.071
898.900
**LOL**
899.738
Again, I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have kept it a secret.
902.741
# PENNY
903.534
Well, I have a secret
I've been keeping from you, too.
905.994
# LEONARD
906.161
Is it a secret bank account?
'Cause that would be awesome.
909.498
909.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
910.499
I hate my job.
911.875
# LEONARD
912.501
Really? Why?
914.294
# PENNY
914.461
Because I don't feel good
flirting with doctors for sales.
917.172
917.339
I mean, I know I make a lot of money,
but I haven't been happy for a while.
920.384
# LEONARD
921.427
Why didn't you tell me?
922.667
# PENNY
922.761
Because I know how important it is to you
that I'm having some success.
925.431
# LEONARD
925.514
That's not true.
926.557
# PENNY
926.723
Okay, really? So you'd be fine
927.975
928.142
if I went back to acting
and waiting tables again?
930.269
# LEONARD
930.436
If that's what you wanna do, yes.
932.187
# PENNY
932.354
Well, it's not what I wanna do.
933.877
# LEONARD
933.877
Oh, yes!

**LOL**
# PENNY
936.859
Doesn't matter what I want.
938.026
938.193
Look, this job
is gonna get me out of debt,
939.873
940.028
so I'm gonna do the grown-up thing
and see it through.
942.148
# LEONARD
943.615
Wow. That is the grown-up thing.
945.534
# PENNY
945.993
I guess.
