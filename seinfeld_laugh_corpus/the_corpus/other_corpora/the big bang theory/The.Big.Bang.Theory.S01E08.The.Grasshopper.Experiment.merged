The online description
was completely misleading.
18.311
18.477
They said eight slots plus removable ID.
20.938
21.105
To any rational person,
that would mean room for nine cards.
24.025
24.191
But they don't tell you,
the removable ID takes up one slot.
27.028
27.194
It's a nightmare.

Romantic love as the basis for marriage
has only existed since the 19th century.

214.507
Up until then, arranged marriages were
the norm and it served society quite well.

It's the premise of Fiddler on the Roof.

I'm not a big fan of musicals,

# HOWARD

Me too. Of course,
it speaks to me culturally.
226.018

Understandable, but there's a universality
to that story which transcends ethnicity.

Not as high as air traffic controllers,

When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...
822.572
822.739
...my mother would read it.
824.116
824.282
It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...
827.327
827.494
...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.
830.497
830.664
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.
