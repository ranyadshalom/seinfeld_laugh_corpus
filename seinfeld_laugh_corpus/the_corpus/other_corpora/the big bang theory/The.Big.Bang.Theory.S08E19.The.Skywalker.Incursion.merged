Leonard, I've been working on an opening
joke for our lecture at Berkeley.

# LEONARD
7.550
Ooh, I like to laugh, but say it anyway.
10.637
10.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
11.638
Okay. Uh...
13.640
13.806
"What do you say to a graduate
of the UC Berkeley Physics Department?"
17.977
18.311
"I'll have fries with that." Heh.
20.355
20.900
**LOL**
21.689
Because his education hasn't prepared him
for a career in the sciences.
26.152
26.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
27.529
When they chase you out of there,
you have to run faster than Sheldon.

# AMY

Are you all set for your trip?
32.992
# SHELDON
32.992
Yeah, I think so.
34.160
34.327
Yeah, I just restocked the old PRK.
37.539
# PENNY
37.789
PRK?
39.311
# LEONARD
39.311
Public restroom kit.
40.833
40.700
**LOL**
41.876
Everything a boy needs for making pee-pee
in new and strange places.
46.005
45.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
46.673
I don't see what's crazy about bringing a
backpack with your own toilet paper and Purell.
50.843
# LEONARD
51.052
Keep going.
52.679
52.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
53.221
And rubber gloves, air freshener...
55.807
55.974
...uh, noise-canceling headphones.
58.351
58.518
Oh, danger whistle.
59.894
60.061
Um... Pepper spray.
62.689
60.900
**LOL**
62.855
Ooh, a multi-language "occupied" sign.
65.400
65.700
**LOL**
66.442
Let's see. We have seat protectors,
uh, booties for my shoes...
70.238
70.446
...a Clothespin for my nose.
72.323
72.532
Oh, and a mirror on a stick...
75.368
73.200
**LOL**
75.577
...so I can make sure the person in the
stall next to me isn't some kind of weirdo.
80.331
80.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
83.126
You're still worried some Berkeley girl
is gonna steal him away?
86.212
# AMY

Yes, who do you think gave him
the danger whistle?
88.965
117.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
117.910
Would you like to play a physics car game
I invented called I Can't Spy?
122.415
123.000
**LOL**
123.750
It's all the nail-biting
tension of I Spy...
125.835
126.002
...but the added fun of subatomic particles
and waves outside the visible spectrum.
130.965
131.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
131.299
If it's half as much fun as One Times Ten to the
Fourth Bottles of Beer on the Wall, I'm in.
136.304
136.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
137.305
I'll begin. Uh...
138.389
138.598
I can't spy with my little eye...
143.645
143.895
...something passing right through us.
146.397
# LEONARD
146.606
That soy Frappuccino I had. Heh.
148.941
148.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
149.609
Will you please play the game?
151.027
151.194
I can't spy with my little eye
something passing right through us.
155.448
# LEONARD
155.657
I don't know. Um...
157.825
157.992
If 65 billion solar neutrinos pass
through a square centimeter every second...
162.538
162.789
...given the surface area of this car
is about 60,000 square centimeters...
166.459
166.626
...that means 3.9 times 10
to the 15th solar neutrinos?
170.963
# SHELDON
173.424
I don't want to play anymore.
175.218
175.100

# LEONARD
177.136
Haven't been on a road trip in a while,
this is fun.
179.514
# SHELDON
179.681
We get it, you won the game, stop bragging.
182.475
181.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
182.975
We wrote a paper together. Now we get to go
to a university and talk about it.
186.646
186.813
That's pretty cool.
187.980
# SHELDON
189.023
I suppose it is.
190.817
191.025
In fact, if you'd like to celebrate
with a little music...
195.154
195.321
...I'd be okay with that.
196.989
# LEONARD
197.657
What?
199.701

This road trip just got crazy. Ha, ha.
203.746

Play that funky music, white boy.

# LEONARD
208.668
I'm surprised you know that reference.
210.503

What reference?

# BERNADETTE
216.884
I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.
We need help taking it all out to the driveway.

# AMY
221.556
Can I be in charge of pricing? I've been
going to garage sales my whole life.
225.226
225.476
Can you believe I got these panty hose
for a nickel?
228.396
229.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
229.355
All right, Amy's in charge of pricing
and being 75.

# RAJ
234.402
Hey, Penny, can you give me a hand with this?
235.653
# PENNY
235.653
Sure.
236.904
237.113
We had one of these growing up.
I used to play all the time.
239.907
# RAJ
240.116
Oh, yeah? I love Ping-Pong.
241.701
# PENNY
242.201
Oh, I meant Beer Pong.
243.745
244.200
**LOL**
# AMY
244.787
I had a table too, but I didn't have
any friends, so all I did was serve.
250.209
250.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
250.752
You can leave one side up
and play against it.
253.004
# AMY
253.296
And if I had a friend,
they might have told me that.
255.715
256.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
259.510
Excuse me, why is there a sticker on this?
262.263
262.513
It's my TARDIS from Doctor Who.
I was planning on moving it in the house.
266.225
# BERNADETTE
266.809
I think you just answered
your own question.
269.395
269.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
269.896
Come on, one day this may double in value
and be worth half what I paid for it.
275.067
275.300
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
275.526
We have a lot to do.
We don't need to decide this right now.
278.446
# HOWARD
278.946
Well, I guess as long
as you're keeping an open mind.
281.574
# BERNADETTE
281.741
Of course.
283.951
286.400

290.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
292.919
Play that funky music right
295.630
294.000
**LOL**
297.173
Play that funky music, white boy
299.425
299.592
So they're requesting that the white boy
play the funky music, yes?
304.597
304.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
305.556
Yes.
306.599
# SHELDON
306.933
And this music we're listening to right now
is funky as well?
311.562
# LEONARD
312.814
Sure.
314.607
314.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
315.316
Let me ask you this.
316.609
316.776
Do you think this song is the music
the white boy ultimately plays?
322.448
322.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
324.367
It could be.
326.327
# SHELDON
326.577
So it's like the musical equivalent
of Russell's paradox.
329.956
330.122
The question of whether
the set of all sets...
332.583
332.792
...that don't contain themselves as members
contains itself.
335.878
# LEONARD
336.128
Exactly.
337.505
# SHELDON
337.505
Well, then I hate it.
338.881
339.131
Music should just be fun.
340.466
341.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
343.594
We're making great time.
We're gonna be there pretty early.
346.889
# SHELDON

Will our hotel room be ready?
348.641
# LEONARD
348.850
I doubt it.
349.976
# SHELDON
350.852
Aren't you worried that sitting in the
lobby for a long period of time...
354.230
354.480
...might attract the attention
of the hotel detective?
357.900
357.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
358.818
If we do, we'll just tell him
to "Hit the bricks, see."
362.488
362.000

# SHELDON
364.490
Seems a little confrontational,
but all right.

You know, we won't be very far
from Skywalker Ranch.
372.748

372.915
Ah. That's true.
But it's not like we can get in there.
376.627
# SHELDON
377.044
Why not?
378.399
# LEONARD
378.399
I don't think George Lucas...
379.755
380.006
...put his headquarters in the middle of
nowhere because he wanted people dropping in.
384.510
# SHELDON
384.719
Yoda's swamp
was in the middle of nowhere.

Tatooine was in the middle of nowhere.
390.182

Hoth was in the middle of nowhere.
393.686

That's code, Leonard.

He wants us to drop in.

We do have time. I mean, we could
drive by and just look at it.

Tricky finding the balance...

# AMY
436.479
Have you made a decision
about the TARDIS?

I think I can sell it
if we call it "Big British Porta-Potty."
442.693

# HOWARD
444.737
We're not selling it. It's mine.

You can't just decide.

How about I arm-wrestle you?

# HOWARD
450.242
That's not fair.
451.494

It's like me challenging you
to a sexy pants contest.
455.247

**LOL**
# RAJ
457.083
You could play Ping-Pong for it.
458.418
# HOWARD
458.418
I would do that.
459.752
# BERNADETTE
459.919
How is that fair? You grew up with a table.
461.921
# HOWARD
462.129
Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in
an ongoing war between the Transformers...
466.258
466.425
...and the ThunderCats for control
of a bra I had found in the woods.
469.720

**LOL**
# PENNY
471.472
For every episode of Doctor Who
Leonard has made me sit through...
474.558
474.767
...l will play on your behalf
and send that TARDIS back to Gallifrey...
478.270
478.437
...where I hate that I know it belongs.
480.648
480.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
481.315
Yes, Penny plays for me.

She has upper body muscles.

496.122
# AMY
496.288
Oh, you just chose champions.
497.790
497.999
Like reenacting the ancient German practice
of trial by combat.
500.918
# PENNY
501.127
Like when the Mountain fought the Red Viper
in Game of Thrones.
504.130
# BERNADETTE

Leonard makes you watch that?
505.526
# PENNY

It's got dragons and people doing it.
509.051

# HOWARD
510.886
It's settled. Fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS will
be decided by a Game of Thrones-inspired...

of ThunderCats versus Transformers.

Well, so do I, but they'll never let us.

I think what really needs to be rescued is
your sense of whimsy, but one quest at a time.

# LEONARD
672.214
Well, what's your plan?
673.757
# SHELDON
673.966
All right, my plan
is predicated on the assumption...
677.052
677.261
...that they have a nurse's office...

679.180
...and your willingness
to be lightly stabbed.

I'd take a picture,

Hey, Raj, if Howard can't keep the TARDIS,
how great would it look at your place?

I don't know much about Doctor Who
but if, urn...
793.252
793.419
...you were to put this right outside
your front door...
796.005
796.213
...and open up the back...
798.590
798.799
...it would be like your entire apartment
was the inside of the TARDIS.
803.095
803.429
Which is pretty cool,
because on the show...
805.764
805.973
...the inside of the TARDIS
is bigger than the outside.
809.852
810.311
But then again,
I don't know much about Doctor Who.

# LEONARD

I don't know.

Maybe they'll call Imperial officers to take
us to a holding cell on the Death Star.

882.466
Oh, I think that's below the pay grade

Honestly, I just wanted to meet Mr. Lucas

Growing up, the movies
had such an impact on my life.
920.087
920.587
I never really fit in anywhere
till I discovered the worlds he created...
924.800
925.008

Oh, I hopped a fence...
932.141

And just so you know, when this started...
999.291
999.458
...l was going to put the TARDIS
in a discreet corner...
1002.044
1002.211
...but now it's going
right in the middle of the living room...
1005.130

with a sign that says "Suck it." Game on.

...we were almost arrested,
and you got me locked in a room...

down the throat of a stuffed Wookiee.

The glass is empty, Sheldon.
It's completely empty.

of thirst, he would be dead. You know why?

Before I answer, was he a smoker?

And even though we're not allowed back there,
they can never take today away from us.
