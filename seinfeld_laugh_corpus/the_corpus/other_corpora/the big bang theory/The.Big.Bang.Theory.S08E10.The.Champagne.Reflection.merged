...the Final Episode Flagtacular."
13.932
14.800
**LOL**
16.226
I knew it was coming, still scary.
18.728
18.500
**LOL**
19.103
Now, I'm sure you're
20.605
20.772
"The final episode? Who will stand
between us and flag ignorance?"
25.235
# AMY
25.401
I know I was thinking that.
27.695
27.400
**LOL**
27.862
Is this a show on flags or mind reading?
31.115
31.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
31.616
But the truth is I can no longer balance
a full-time career...
34.827
34.994
...a popular Internet
show, and a girlfriend.
37.580
# AMY
37.747
And he really does have one,
you jerks on the comment board.
41.459
41.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
42.794
So as they say,
all good things must come to an end.
45.838
# AMY
46.005
After only 232 episodes.
49.425
49.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
49.592
Two hundred thirty-three if we include the
one somebody forgot to press record on.
54.264
54.000
**LOL**
# AMY
55.431
You said you weren't gonna bring that up.
57.141
# SHELDON
57.141
And you said you pressed record.
58.851
59.300
**LOL**
60.812
Anyway, please, sit back, relax
and join us as we take our final lap...
66.359
67.000
**LOL**
67.902
...as indicated by the waving
of this racing flag.
70.196
70.363
Of course, white flags
can also represent surrender...
72.991
73.157
...the Stewards of Gondor,
and the Japanese Minamoto clan.
75.994
76.160
But I'm sure you remember
that from episode 62:
78.663
78.830
"White
80.269
80.269
Who's Waving Them and Why."
81.708
81.800
**LOL**
# AMY
83.334
That was a good one.
84.335
# SHELDON
84.335
That was so good.
85.336
112.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
112.697
You know, I thought cleaning out
a dead professor's office...
115.533
115.700
...was just going to be boring,
but then I found his dentures...
119.120
119.287
...and realized it's also gross.
122.332
122.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
123.958
Doesn't Professor Abbott's family
want any of this stuff?
126.878
# LEONARD
127.045
I don't think he had a family.
128.088
# RAJ
128.088
That's rough.
129.130
# LEONARD
129.297
I know. You can spend
your whole life working...
131.507
131.674
...and, at the end, all that's left
are some papers in a box.
135.136
# HOWARD
135.303
Makes you think.
137.597
138.264
Oh, Well.
140.183
139.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
140.391
Hey, we're supposed to look through
this before we throw it away...
143.561
143.728
...in case it's important.
145.563
# HOWARD
145.563
I did. It's all outdated or disproved.
147.398
# RAJ
147.565
I don't know, this old pen
kind of proves gravity.
150.777
150.943
When I tilt it, her bathing
suit falls right off.
153.696
153.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
155.031
My dad used to have a pen like that.
I dated it all through sixth grade.
159.577
159.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
160.453
It still feels weird
just throwing away his work like this.
163.164
# HOWARD
163.331
Don't feel bad, some day
someone will be throwing out your work too.
167.502
167.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
168.461
That someone was Sheldon
and the day was yesterday.
171.798
171.700
**LOL**
173.174
Hey, look at this.
174.759
175.760
"Dear Roger, to be opened upon
your first great discovery. Love, Mom."
180.390
180.765
Wow, look at the date.
182.725
182.892
He saved this 50 years
and never got to open it.
185.687
# HOWARD
186.938
That's intense.
188.564
# RAJ
188.731
Poor Roger Abbott.
190.692
# HOWARD
191.859
Roger Abbott sounds just like Roger Rabbit.
195.196
195.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
196.864
Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott, Roger Abbott.
199.742
199.700

199.909
Oh, my God, Leonard,
I know he's dead, but try it, it's fun.
203.121
203.900

# PENNY
210.315
Hi.
212.004
212.171
Dan. My boss who didn't want to hire me
and now he's a little hug machine.
216.843
217.200
**LOL**
# DAN
217.009
Look at you. Brand-new
and already the third best sales rep.

Come over to my table.
222.348
# PENNY
222.348
I'll be right there.
223.391

Bernadette's just parking the car.

225.393
Oh, good. Heh. Bernadette.
228.771
227.200

Cute, sweet, vicious little Bernadette.
232.108

**LOL**
# PENNY
233.609
Come on. She's not that bad.
234.902
# DAN
235.069
Oh, yeah? At the company picnic,
she yelled at me and my grandson...
238.239
238.406
...for losing the three-legged race.
240.116
240.600
**LOL**
240.283
He still calls her "that mean kid
with the big boobies."
244.746
245.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
246.164
I know she can be a little intense, but I
swear, she is so sweet once you get past
250.168

# BERNADETTE
250.334
Hey, what are you talking about?
252.419
# PENNY
252.419
About how much we love working with you.
254.505
254.672
Isn't that right, Dan?
257.008
257.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
260.678
Over the years here at Fun With Flags, we've
had an opportunity to learn, laugh, wonder...
266.392
# AMY
266.559
And yes, even shed a tear or two.
269.812
270.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
270.938
Like when you do a two-hour Fourth of July
spectacular and it doesn't get recorded.
276.194
276.100
**LOL**
# AMY
277.487
How many times do I have to say I'm sorry?
279.489
# SHELDON
279.655
How about 4000? One for every domino
I set up to make that American flag.
285.369
281.500
**LOL**
285.800
**LOL**
287.622
Please enjoy these highlights.

Crikey. What flag do we have today?
295.087

**LOL**
# AMY
298.382
Australia, mate.
300.468
302.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
304.096
And now it's time for the speed round
of "Flag or not a Flag."
308.559
309.200
**LOL**
# KRIPKE
308.726
Flag. Flag. Not a flag. Flag.
I'm crushing this.
315.066
315.400
**LOL**
# AMY
320.279
Say, Betsy Ross,
what are you working on?
323.491
# SHELDON
324.075
I have no idea...
326.744
326.600
**LOL**
327.537
...because the story of me
sewing the first American flag...
331.165
331.332
...is unsupported poppycock.
333.835
334.000
**LOL**
# AMY
334.669
Then who did sew it?
336.671
# SHELDON
336.838
Don't ask me.
338.422
338.589
I'm just a simple seamstress
whose descendants
341.884
342.051
Are out to make a quick buck.

Fancy a dip, my dear?
353.813
# AMY
353.980
I do.
355.606
356.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
357.817
Wait. That purple flag indicates that marine
pests, such as jellyfish, are present.
363.030
# AMY
363.197
Wow, that flag is a lifesaver.
366.200
# SHELDON
366.367
No, this is.
370.037
370.400
**LOL**
372.290
Stop looking at my legs.
374.250

Not a flag. Flag. Flag. Not a flag. Flag.
380.256
381.591
Eh, crap.
382.884
383.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
385.595
When stuff like this gets me down,
you know what I like to do?
388.472
# HOWARD
388.639
Sing "Hakuna Matata"
like an 8-year-old girl?
391.309
391.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
392.310
Wrong, smarty-pants.
393.686
393.853
It's "Everything is Awesome"
from The Lego Movie.
396.355
396.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
398.649
Look at these notebooks.
They're full of pages and pages of data.
401.944
402.111
He clearly spent years on this.
403.988
# HOWARD
404.155
It's just columns of random numbers.
Toss it.
406.949
# LEONARD
407.116
But what if this was a potential
breakthrough for him?
409.619
409.785
What if this is the thing that would've
let him open that bottle of champagne?
413.581
# RAJ
413.748
Maybe he didn't know what to pair
champagne with.
416.500
416.667
Strawberries, caviar, oysters,
all good choices.
420.046
420.000
**LOL**
421.505
That look right there is why people eat
before they come to your parties.
424.967
425.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
426.385
This has to mean something.
428.930
# HOWARD
429.305
There's no discernible pattern
that I can see...
432.183
432.350
...but it shouldn't be too hard
to run the numbers and check.
435.186
# LEONARD
435.353
Maybe we can get some time
on the supercomputer.
437.521
# HOWARD
437.688
Sure, we could try multiple regressions...
439.690
439.857
...with varying physical
and experimental constants.
442.276
# LEONARD
442.443
We could run a pattern-matching algorithm
against unsolved physics problems.
446.280
# HOWARD
446.447
Ooh, it might be a substitution cipher.
We could start with basic cryptanalysis.
450.743
# RAJ
450.910
Or we could go talk to this guy
he used to share an office with.
454.205
453.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
456.165
Oh, let's do that.
458.000
457.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
458.960
You don't know how to do
cryptanalysis, do you?
461.337
# HOWARD
461.504
Yeah, I'm not even sure
if it's the right word.
464.048
463.600

# PENNY
472.765
So, Dan, you have a grandson.
How old is he?
475.351

Seven.
476.206
# BERNADETTE
476.206
Oh, yeah.
476.894
477.061
I remember him from the picnic.
479.146
479.689
He was the one crying like a wuss
the whole time.
482.316
482.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
483.609
I heard he was being picked on
by a mean kid, heh.
486.904
# BERNADETTE
487.071
Just builds character.
488.572
488.739
Like my dad said, "Nobody likes a crybaby
except their mommies and Democrats."
492.576
# DAN
494.120
I need another drink.
495.913
495.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
497.748
What's his problem?
498.958
# PENNY
499.125
I don't know, maybe he didn't like the fact
you called his grandson a wuss.
502.628
501.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
502.795
Well, I didn't think you were supposed
to say "sissy" anymore.
505.673
505.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
507.091
Okay, look, I know
what a good person you are...
509.552
509.719
...but sometimes people think
you might come off a little harsh.
512.680
# BERNADETTE
512.847
What? I'm like the sweetest person I know.
516.183
516.300

Look at me, I should be in a tree
baking cookies.
520.396
520.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
521.939
Yes, but once in a while,
people think you're a little mean.
526.736
# BERNADETTE
526.902
Oh, yeah? You one of those people?
529.572
530.400

No, no, no. I think the cookie thing.

Wait. Since you're here, I'd like
to get your opinion on something.
573.949
574.116
In honor of Black History Month,
I portrayed George Washington Carver...
578.245
578.412
...in a loving tribute that my
roommate called "wildly racist."
583.250
583.700
**LOL**
583.751
What do you think?
585.002
585.169

Hi, my name is George.

Oh, hell, no.

No, it's not racist.

Are we sure this is the place?

The doorman said
this is the right building.

I think if you're pulling up your pants,
you're not a doorman.

Can I help you?

# LEONARD
617.639
Hi, we're from the university.
618.744
618.911
We're trying to get some information
about Professor Abbott.
621.705
# HOWARD
621.872
We were cleaning out his office
and found these books full of numbers.
625.084
# LEONARD
625.251
Any chance you know what it is?
626.731
# PROFSHARPE
626.731
He was always working on this.
628.212
# RAJ
628.379
I was thinking it might be
an interstellar coordinate system.
631.215
631.382
Maybe an updated version
of Hubble's law.
633.300
633.467
I keep seeing the number 90 repeating.
635.719
635.886
That could be the angle of perturbation
of a distant galaxy.
638.681
# PROFSHARPE
638.848
It's the number of calories in a yogurt.
That's his food diary.
644.019
641.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
644.186
Really?
645.417
# PROFSHARPE
645.417
Yeah. He wrote down everything he ever ate.
646.647
646.814
He was convinced that calorie restriction
was the key to living forever.
650.484
# RAJ
650.651
Does it work?
652.152
652.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
652.152
Seriously?
653.654

653.821
He could have been hit by a bus.
You don't know.

656.800
**LOL**
# PROFSHARPE
658.492
Sorry it's not more interesting.
659.994
660.161
On the bright side, you didn't have to
listen to his stomach growl for 35 years.
664.081
663.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
664.748
So was there anything Professor Abbott
worked on during his life...
667.835
668.002
...that came close to an accomplishment?
670.045
# PROFSHARPE
670.212
To be honest,
his research never amounted to anything.
673.757
# RAJ
673.924
You were his colleague.
How did yours turn out?
676.343

Great, this is the apartment you get

I'm not a bully.
I mean, maybe I come off a little strong...
693.694
693.800

...but that's because my dad raised me to
be tough and not to take crap from anybody.

# PENNY
697.948
That's fine. There's a difference
between being tough...
700.534
700.400
**LOL**
700.701
...and telling your friend
her new pants look like a saggy diaper.
704.246
705.100
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
706.790
I did say that, didn't I?
708.334
# PENNY
708.500
Yeah, you did. I felt so self-conscious
I had to return them.
712.254
# BERNADETTE
712.880
Where? To Babies "R" Us?
715.174
714.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
715.841
You're doing it again.
717.968
# BERNADETTE
718.135
Sorry. Can we just go?
I feel like everybody hates me.
720.763
# PENNY
720.930
Come on, they don't hate you,
they're just a little intimidated.
723.891
723.200
**LOL**
724.058
All you need to do is show
everyone how sweet you are.
726.727
# BERNADETTE
726.894
I think I'd rather go.
728.166
# PENNY
728.166
No. You're not going anywhere.
729.438
728.800
**LOL**
729.605
All right? I'm here for you
and we're gonna fix this together.
732.608
732.300
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
732.775
Thank you.
734.255
# PENNY
734.255
Even though your dress is ugly.
735.736
736.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
739.573
Well, my little flag-keteers, it looks like the
last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end.
746.038
743.200
**LOL**
746.205
If I could, I would run each and every
one of you viewers up a flagpole...
751.252
751.418
...and salute you.
753.212
753.100
**LOL**
754.463
And if you touched the ground, burn you.
756.966
757.100
**LOL**
758.133
I'd like to take a moment to personally
thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler...
761.720
761.887
...who you may or may not know
is the first woman to co-host...
766.225
766.392
...a flag or banner related
Internet info-tainment show.
770.896
770.500
**LOL**
# AMY
771.897
Take that, glass ceiling.
773.857
773.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
775.484
And if I may get serious for a moment...
778.570
779.989
...hosting this show has been
one crazy ride.
785.244
786.000
**LOL**
786.620
With all its ups and downs,
I wouldn't give it up for the world.
791.959
793.377
Except for now, when I'm giving it up.
796.255
795.500
**LOL**
798.882
Before I sign off, I'd, uh...
801.719
801.885
I'd like to share with you all
one last use for a white
805.889
807.141
It's good for times like this.
809.435
810.200
**LOL**
812.313
Good night.
813.772
# AMY
814.523
Cut.
816.317
817.234
Sheldon.
818.902
820.821
That was beautiful.
822.052
# SHELDON
822.052
If you didn't press record
823.282
# AMY
823.449
I pressed it!
825.242
825.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
830.372
Well, that's it.
That's the end of Roger Abbott.
835.336
836.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
838.047
And we still don't know who framed him.
840.716
841.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
843.260
I still keep thinking about how an entire
life can seemingly amount to nothing.
847.806
# HOWARD
848.057
I guess the sad truth is not everyone
will accomplish something great.
853.187
854.355
Some of us may just have to find meaning
in the little moments that make up life.
860.319
# LEONARD
861.779
That's a nice way of looking at it.
863.405
# HOWARD
864.531
Yeah, for you, not for me.
I went to space, so I'm covered.
867.242
868.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
870.662
You know what? This bottle was
meant to celebrate an achievement.
874.917
875.084
Let's make a pact. When one of us
gets their first big breakthrough...
878.629
878.796
...we'll celebrate by opening this bottle
of champagne and toasting Professor Abbott.
883.550
# HOWARD
883.717
I love that.
884.864
# RAJ
884.864
Me too.
886.011
# LEONARD
886.178
And of course, rubbing our success
in Sheldon's face.
889.139
# RAJ
889.306
That's the best part, really.
890.245
890.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
890.245
Yeah.
891.183
# BERNADETTE
893.435
Dan, could I talk to you for a minute'?
895.687
897.900
**LOL**
# DAN
899.400
Sure, go ahead.
901.193
# BERNADETTE
901.402
I just want you to know I didn't mean
to be rude about your grandson.
905.155
# DAN
905.322
It's okay.
906.407
# BERNADETTE
906.407
No, it's not.
907.491
907.658
Penny told me that everyone's scared of me.
909.868
# DAN
910.035
What?
912.538
912.100
**LOL**
912.704
Why would she say that?
You know she drinks, right?
915.207
915.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
915.374
What?
917.167
# BERNADETTE
917.334
No, she's right.
918.377
918.544
I just want you to know, from now on,
I'm gonna be much more sensitive.
921.839
922.005
I don't want anyone walking
on eggshells around me.
924.675
# DAN
924.842
Well, okay. Then, uh, one thing
I've been meaning to tell you...
928.262
928.429
...is the company is gonna
stop paying for our coffee.
931.265
# BERNADETTE
931.432
No problem. When does that start?
933.100
# DAN
933.100
Five months ago.
934.768
935.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
# DAN
# BERNADETTE
935.477
What? Who's been paying for my coffee?
937.417
# DAN
937.417
Yeah. All of us.
939.356
939.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
939.523
It comes from the swear jar
we put money in when you curse.
942.526
943.500
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
946.196
What else don't I know about?
947.739
# PENNY
947.906
Uh, well, you know your private bathroom?
949.637
# BERNADETTE
949.637
Yeah.
951.368
# PENNY
951.535
That was supposed to be for the whole floor.
953.350
953.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
953.350
You're kidding.
955.164
# DAN
955.330
No, no. It's okay, it really only affected
Wheelchair Kathy...
958.917
959.084
...and she's back in the hospital now,
so it all worked out.
961.920
961.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
963.630
I feel so bad.
965.132
# PENNY
965.299
Then maybe you shouldn't have named her
Wheelchair Kathy.
968.135
968.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
969.845
Oh, my God, I thought everybody liked me,
but I'm just a monster.
974.850
# DAN
975.017
But a cute one, like that eyeball guy
in Monsters, Inc.
978.562
978.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
979.646
No, I'm the worst. I'm a terrible person.
983.066
# DAN
983.233
Come on, don't cry. It's okay.
985.486
# BERNADETTE
985.652
It's not okay.
How can I even work here anymore?
988.489
987.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
988.655
Because this company needs you.
990.657
# DAN
990.657
It's fine, we don't mind paying for the coffee.
992.659
# BERNADETTE
992.826
I can't let you do that.
995.078
# DAN
995.245
Maybe we could get you an
espresso machine for your office.
999.666
# BERNADETTE
999.833
I guess that would be all right.
1003.003
1002.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
1004.338
See? You don't have to be mean
to get what you want.
1007.424
# BERNADETTE
1007.591
You're right. Now, where did we land
on my bathroom?
1011.678

I posted the last episode
of Fun with Flags hours ago...
1024.233
1024.399
...and not a single person
cared enough to comment.
1027.069
1028.100
**LOL**
1029.279
All that effort for nothing.
1031.323
# LEONARD
1031.532
Hmm.
1032.574
1032.741
I know how you feel. I spent the day
throwing out a man's entire career...
1036.119
1036.286
...and all that's left is an old bottle
of champagne...
1038.830
1038.997
...and a naked lady pen Raj took
when he thought no one was looking.
1042.334
1042.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1044.586
It's not the same thing.
I don't think you know how I feel at all.

Sad?

You do get me.
1054.596
1054.800
**LOL**
1057.724
Someone left a comment.
1059.059
# LEONARD
1059.226
Yeah? What did they say?
1060.394
# SHELDON
1060.561
"Too bad your show is done.
I kind of liked it."
1064.147
1064.314
Leonard, did you hear that?
1066.817
1067.818
The people are heartbroken.
1070.654
1070.600

I can't take this away from the world.

I just wanted to hear the pop.

You told me not to call and I didn't know
how else to give you the good news.

At least listen to the premise.

we could talk about German flags.
