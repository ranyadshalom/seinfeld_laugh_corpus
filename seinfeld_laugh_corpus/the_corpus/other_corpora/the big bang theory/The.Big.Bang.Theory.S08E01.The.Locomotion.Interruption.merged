A few things don't go your way...

Forty-five days ago...
59.686
59.852
...um, I embarked
on a railroad journey of healing...
62.730
62.897
...because my university
was making me do string theory...
65.942
66.109
...my favorite comic-book store
burned down...
68.194
68.361
...and when my roommate got engaged,
my girlfriend wanted to move in with me.
72.365
72.532
Which was no doubt a ploy just to see my...
75.076
73.200

# SHELDON

I understand that I'm half-naked...
87.297
87.463
...but there is a reasonable explanation.
While I slept in my sleeper car...
91.718
91.884
...all my possessions were stolen.
93.678
93.845
Now, typically, I wear pajamas...
96.055
96.222
...but I recently adopted
a hobo lifestyle...
100.018
97.600
**LOL**
100.184
...and pajamas are
the sleep-pants of the man.
103.605
106.200
**LOL**
106.107
I'll have you know
Mahatma Gandhi wore no pants...
108.568
108.735
...and a nation rallied behind him!
110.612
111.300
**LOL**
111.738
My good man, now, before you walk away,
I know that I may appear deranged...
115.533
115.700
...but I am, in fact,
a world-renowned physicist.

Ask me the difference between a boson
and a fermion. Go ahead, ask.
122.874

Bosons have integer spin.

223.975
224.142
And my mail. And a really good comeback
for Chicken Legs...
227.770

He was.
285.328

But now that her cast is off, he moved out.

And, honestly, I'm kind of glad.

she calls him Stewie...
311.187
311.354
...and they're all giggly
around each other.
313.523

First of all, no one can

Except, instead of pushing fish tacos
because they'll go bad...
429.472
429.639
...you're pushing our antidepressants...
431.515
431.682
...before the FDA finds out
they may cause rectal bleeding.

I didn't have any place to go,
she likes having me around...
507.133
