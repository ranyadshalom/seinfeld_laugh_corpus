The instructions are very clear.
Don't feed the gremlins after midnight.
14.181
14.400
**LOL**
15.891
Don't get the gremlins wet.
18.561

**LOL**
20.187
How hard is that?
22.440

Hi, guys.

Hi, honey.

26.319
Oh, we're "honey" now, are we?
28.738
28.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
28.904
Yes. Since their relationship
became carnal...
31.282
31.449
...Penny has upgraded
his designated term of endearment...
34.118
34.700
**LOL**
34.285
...distinguishing him
from those she calls "sweetie"...
36.829
36.996
...in an attempt to soften
a thinly veiled insult.
40.249
39.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
40.750
You're boring people, sweetie.
43.628
# SHELDON
44.211
Although sometimes
she omits the veil entirely.
47.632
47.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
48.215
So, what are you guys doing?
49.696
# HOWARD
49.696
Celebrating Columbus Day.
51.177
# LEONARD
51.344
We're watching Goonies, Gremlins
and Young Sherlock Holmes.
54.680
54.847
They're all written by Chris Columbus.
57.224
57.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
58.517
Okay. What do you watch
on Thanksgiving?
61.228
# SHELDON
61.395
The parade.
63.356
63.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
64.857
That reminds me. I usually go back
to Nebraska for Thanksgiving.
67.943
68.110
This year, they're calling it off
on account of my brother's trial.
71.197
# LEONARD
71.364
What's he on trial for?
73.199
# PENNY
73.199
Oh, just a big misunderstanding.
75.034
75.201
You know, you'd like my brother.
He's kind of a chemist.
78.287
79.500
**LOL**
81.290
I was thinking
I'd have Thanksgiving here.
83.292
83.459
And you are all invited.
84.543
# LEONARD
84.543
Oh, I'll be there.
85.628
# SHELDON
85.795
Will you be serving cranberry jelly
or cranberry sauce?
89.799
89.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
90.257
I guess I could serve both.
91.592
# SHELDON
91.759
You guess? You don't seem
to have much of a handle on this.
95.721
95.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
96.764
Yeah, I really wish I could,
Penny, but every year...
99.266
99.433
...my mother has all the relatives over
and cooks up her famous tur-briska-fil.
104.438
104.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
105.106
Tur-briska-fil?
106.607
# HOWARD
106.899
A turkey stuffed with a brisket
stuffed with gefilte fish.
110.069
110.000
**LOL**
112.029
It's not as good as it sounds.
114.657

# PENNY
115.408
Raj, what about you?
116.742
# HOWARD
116.909
Oh, he usually comes
to my house. Right, pal?
118.669
121.600
**LOL**
122.998
Uh, all right. This year,
you don't have to eat the tur-briska-fil.
127.002
126.800
**LOL**
128.504
I don't even chew it.
I swallow it like pills.
130.965

# LEONARD
158.993
So, what's going on with Raj?
160.536
# HOWARD
160.745
Well, the good news
is he has no problem...
163.497
163.664
...with my mother's tur-briska-fil.
165.666
# PENNY
165.833
Hard to believe, but go on.
168.669
168.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
168.836
The bad news
is he says he's getting deported.
171.464
# LEONARD
171.630
What do you mean
he's getting deported?
173.466
# SHELDON
173.632
I believe it means the U.S. government
is going to expel him from the country.
177.511
175.900
**LOL**
177.678
He could return to India, immigrate to
another country willing to accept him...
181.974
182.141
...or wander the high seas
as a stateless pirate.
184.852
185.700
**LOL**
188.189
Personally, I'd choose pirate.
190.316
190.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
191.859
Penny, would you mind stepping outside
so we can speak to him?
194.612
# PENNY
194.779
Ugh. Fine, but the man really needs to work
on his girl issues.
198.866
# SHELDON
199.033
Another reason
to consider a life of piracy.
201.160
201.327
Even today, I understand
that's an all-male profession.
204.205
204.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
206.582
Okay, she's gone.
208.876
# RAJ
212.922
Sorry I lost my cool.

# LEONARD

So, what's going on?
218.427
# RAJ
218.594
Okay, here's the deal.
219.887
220.054
Six months ago, my research
testing the predicted composition...
223.224
223.390
...of trans-Neptunian objects
ran into a dead end.
225.893
# HOWARD
226.060
So?
227.228
# RAJ
227.394
My visa is only good as long
as I'm employed at the university.
230.397
230.564
When they find out I've got squat,
they're gonna cut me off.
233.567
233.734
By the way, when I say "squat,"
I mean "diddlysquat."
236.904
236.300
**LOL**
237.530
I wish I had squat.
240.074
239.800

# LEONARD
240.950
Wait. What have you been doing
for the past six months?
243.744
# RAJ
243.911
You know, checking e-mail...
246.080
246.247
...updating my Facebook status...
248.249
248.415
...messing up Wikipedia entries.
250.918
250.600
**LOL**
252.920
Did you know Netflix lets you
stream movies on your computer now?
256.423
255.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
256.841
You've continued to take the university's
money under false pretenses?
260.302
260.469
Highly unethical for an astrophysicist.
262.930
263.097
Although, practically mandatory
for a pirate.
265.933
266.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
267.768
I don't wanna go back to India.
It's hot and loud.
270.437
270.604
And there's so many people.
273.107
273.500

You have no idea. They're everywhere.

Okay, guys, think.
How do we keep Raj in the country?

Why doesn't he just get another job?
289.582
288.000

**LOL**
308.809
Did you know at the Mumbai McDonald's,
you can't get a Big Mac?
311.687
311.854
All you can get
is a Chicken Maharaja Mac.
313.898
314.100
**LOL**
314.773
And the special sauce?
315.983
316.150
Curry. Which in India,
believe you me, is really not that special.

Don't worry. You'll find another job.
322.906

Forgive me.
I'm not adept at reading facial cues.

You're either sad or nauseated.

I've always been a little confused
about this. Why don't Hindus eat beef?
360.152
# RAJ
360.319
We believe cows are gods.
361.591
361.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON

Not technically.
362.863
363.030
In Hinduism,
cattle are thought to be like God.

Do not tell me about my culture.
I'll take you out, I swear to cow.

376.669
# SHELDON
376.835
Mm, understandable. Your life seems
to be crumbling around you...

410.661
# RAJ
410.828
No, no. It's a very promising area.
412.663

In a perfect world,
I'd spend several more years on it.
415.082
415.249
I couldn't pass up the opportunity
to work with you...

I assumed as much, but never fear.

Like the subordinate male protagonist

...halfway through the second reel,
I have returned to save the day.

Odd. Usually he's met by cheers.

How many reels before the subordinate

If you didn't cheer at my entrance,
it's too late to buy into the premise.

Second, my contributions shall be noted
in published materials.
669.127

Third, you are never allowed to lecture me
on Hinduism or my Indian culture.
674.716

**LOL**
# SHELDON
675.133
I'm impressed, Raj.
676.718
676.885
Those are very cogent
and reasonable conditions.
679.137
# RAJ
679.304
Thank you.
680.514
680.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
680.514
I reject them all.
681.723
# RAJ
682.641
Then you leave me no choice.
684.393
684.559
I accept the job.
686.311

**LOL**
# SHELDON
687.479
I'm sorry.
I believe you've misunderstood.
690.148
690.357
I'm not giving you the job.
691.900
692.067
I'm simply affording you the opportunity
to apply for it.
695.153
696.400
**LOL**
697.906
Have a seat.
We'll get started with the interview.
700.409
# RAJ
700.575
You're kidding.
701.618

Please.
703.662

705.080
All right.
706.915
# SHELDON
708.959
So...
710.836

That's what you wear to an interview?

# RAJ
717.009
Come on, we've been friends for years.
718.844

Oh, pulling strings, are we?
722.097
721.500

# RAJ

Sheldon, for God's sakes,
don't make me beg.

# SHELDON
726.476
Buzzinga.
728.353

728.645
You've fallen victim to another one
of my classic practical jokes.
733.275
732.400

734.609
I'm your boss now.
You may wanna laugh at that.

Ah. This is nice,
having the place to ourselves, isn't it?
744.328
# LEONARD
744.494
Uh-huh.
745.537
745.704
Now that Raj is working for Sheldon,
I don't have to chauffeur him around.
748.790
748.957
Plus, yeah, with them working late
so much, we get some privacy.
751.918
752.085
Mm-hm.
753.295
# PENNY
754.796
Hey.
756.465

Wanna get a little crazy?
758.342
# LEONARD

What are you thinking?
760.135

Let's slide over to Sheldon's spot

Heh.

Am I interrupting?

779.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
779.196
Little bit, yeah.
780.739
# HOWARD
780.906
Guess I should've called.

Yeah, maybe.

You know, whatever.

So, what are we watching?
813.605

# PENNY

Hey, I happen to love this movie.
818.360

Fine. Let's watch it.

Maybe all our periods will synchronize.
823.865
823.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
827.786
We're going to be
designing an experiment...
830.372
830.539
...to look for the annihilation spectrum
resulting from dark-matter collisions.
834.709
# RAJ
834.876
Ooh, dark matter.
We better bring a flashlight, ha, ha.
838.630
838.700
**LOL**
841.216
I was making a joke.
842.384
# SHELDON

I'm the boss. I make the jokes.

**LOL**
# RAJ
847.139
Sorry. Go ahead and make your 'yoke.
849.099
# SHELDON
849.266
This is not the time for joking.
851.393
851.500
**LOL**
851.935
We're doing serious research
which requires complete and utter focus.

Well, usually on Sundays...

937.900
**LOL**
938.396
...but he's still working with Sheldon.
940.232
940.398
So I thought I'd come over here
and make scrambled eggs and salami.

Sure. What's up, homes?

**LOL**
# LEONARD
979.437
Please understand that it's not
that we don't want you around.
982.774

But Penny and I
occasionally need some alone time.
987.529
# HOWARD
989.030
Oh.
990.073

# RAJ
1049.341
No, no. That rate is much too low from
what we'd expect from this collision.
1053.011
1053.345
Do you understand we're talking about
dark matter colliding in outer space?
1057.015
# SHELDON
1057.223
Of course I understand. And who
are you to tell me about outer space?
1060.810
# RAJ
1060.977
Well, I'm the astrophysicist.
"Astro" means "space."
1063.521
# SHELDON
1064.522
"Astro" means "star."
1066.733
1067.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
1067.442
Let me just tell you,
if we were having this argument...
1070.111
1070.278
...in my native language,
I'd be kicking your butt.
1073.323
1073.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1073.740
English is your native language.
1076.826
# RAJ
1077.994
Okay, you got me there.
But you're wrong about this.
1081.331
1080.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1081.498
There's a fine line
between wrong and visionary.
1083.792
1083.958
Unfortunately,
you have to be a visionary to see it.
1086.878
1087.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
1087.045
God, you think that every thought that
comes out of your head is pure gold.
1091.383
1091.549
Let me tell you,
some of those thoughts are pure caca.
1094.302
# SHELDON
1094.469
Caca?
1096.054
1095.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
1096.262
It means "doo-doo."
1097.659
# SHELDON
1097.659
All right.
1099.057
1099.224
First of all, Dr. Koothrappali, when I
first proposed that you work with me
1102.394
# RAJ
1102.560
Aha! So I am working with you?
1104.396
# SHELDON
1104.562
In this context,
"with me" means "for me."
1106.272
# RAJ
1106.439
Oh. Yeah, well, in this
1108.650
1110.026
All right.
1111.653
1110.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1111.820
If I'm wrong, prove it.
1113.530
# RAJ
1113.697
OKEY
1114.739
1114.906
Here's where we derived the mass
of the dark-matter particle.
1118.743
# SHELDON
1118.910
You've misstated the weight.
1119.974
# RAJ
1119.974
Let me finish.
1121.037
# SHELDON
1121.204
You're defacing my work.
1122.622
# RAJ
1122.622
I'm not. I'm fixing it.
1124.040
# SHELDON
1124.207
Give me the eraser.
1125.021
# RAJ
1125.021
No.
1125.834
# SHELDON
1126.000
I said give it to me.
1127.210
# RAJ
1127.669
Come and get it.
1129.587
1129.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON

Fine.

1135.427
Oh, Lord.
1137.554
1137.000
**LOL**
1138.722
Dr. Koothrappali, as your superior,
I forbid you from writing on my board.
1142.600
# RAJ
1142.767
You are not my superior.
1144.102
# SHELDON
1144.102
I am in every way.

# RAJ
1145.603
Oh, yeah? Can you do this?

1194.319
What do you want, Sheldon?
1195.612
# SHELDON
1195.779
I looked over the board,
and it turns out you were right.
1198.990
# RAJ
1199.157
You were wrong?
1199.970
# SHELDON
1199.970
I didn't say that.
1200.784
# RAJ
1200.950
That's the only logical inference.
1202.452
# SHELDON
1202.452
I didn't say it.
1203.953
1203.500
**LOL**
1204.662
Anyway, I would like you to come back
and work for me.
1207.957
# RAJ
1208.249
For you or with you?
1210.001
# SHELDON
1211.002
In this context,
"for me" could mean "with me."
1214.339
# RAJ
1214.506
I have conditions.
1215.423
# SHELDON
1215.423

1223.848
# SHELDON
1224.015
I walked.
1224.766

1224.766
So walk home.
