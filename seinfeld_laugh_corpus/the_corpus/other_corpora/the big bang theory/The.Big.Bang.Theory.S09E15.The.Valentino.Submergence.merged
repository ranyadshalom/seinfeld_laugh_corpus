# RAJ
36.417
lam. lam. I guess I'm still wondering
if Emily and I are right for each other.
40.505
# HOWARD
41.214
Does this have to do with that girl
you had coffee with?
43.758
# RAJ
44.092
You mean the strong, sexy angel
I can't stop thinking about? Who can say?

You've been talking about
breaking up with Emily forever,

Yeah, I think so. Do you have any advice?
104.944
# PENNY
105.445
Well, I have broken up with
my fair share of guys.

I stopped counting at four.

# PENNY
113.202
Great. My advice to you is do it at her
place so you can leave when you need to.
116.497
116.664
Tell the truth, make it quick,
and be prepared for tears.
120.126

191.572
Well, you've become such an integral part
of my life as well as this show,

Well, you turn off the jets,
I'll get a strainer from the kitchen.

Do people like money?
ls that what you're asking?

A lot of attitude from the woman

Now is that a smart thing
to say on a holiday

You two look happy. How do you do it?
425.973
# AMY
426.265
I think it starts with
good communication
427.934

You know what?
That's not a flag question, next caller.

I hope you don't think I'm just saying
this because it's Valentine's Day,

No!

We need to save it.

doubts after breaking up with someone.
559.065
559.648
You really think so?
560.858
# SHELDON
561.025
You know what's not normal?
562.735
562.902
Blubbering about emotions
during a flag show.
565.946
566.700
**LOL**
566.572
Unless that emotion is excitement over
New Zealand changing their flag.
571.035

And good luck you crazy Kiwis,
we're rooting for you.

No, Sheldon's right. Emily did say
I always talk about my feelings too much.
582.254
# SHELDON
583.339
Why, I suppose that could be
a legitimate concern in a relationship.
587.301

How can it be fine? I just got attacked
by a clearly anti-Semitic wild animal.
702.416
702.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
706.629
It's not what we planned,
but this isn't so bad, right?
708.923
# PENNY
709.548
It is freakin' amazing.
711.217
711.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
713.302
Well, I'm glad you're feeling better.
714.845
# PENNY
715.012
I was just hungry and cranky.
716.931
717.431
And I've never been called ma'am before.
719.391
# LEONARD
720.351
Is that a big deal?
721.269
# PENNY
721.269
Kind of.
722.186
722.353
When's the first time
someone's called you sir?
724.193
# LEONARD
724.688
Sixth grade. But I wore a sport coat
and carried a brief case so...
728.275
729.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
730.527
Can you believe when I met you I was 22?
733.072
733.239
I mean, it's crazy.
Where did all that time go?
735.991
# LEONARD
736.742
Hmm, you watched The Bachelor a lot.
739.411
739.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
740.704
Yeah, go ahead and make jokes.
But your 30s are almost over.
743.499
# LEONARD
743.666
No, they're not.
744.708
# PENNY
744.917
You're closer to 40 than you are to 30.
747.002
# LEONARD
747.503
You married an old man.
750.381
750.900
**LOL**
752.007
Tell you what,
let's do something fun tonight.
754.009
# PENNY
754.635
It won't make us any younger.
755.844
# LEONARD
756.011
Well, maybe not,
but someday we actually will be old
758.555
758.722
and we'll look back on this night and
remember what a good time we had.
761.850
# PENNY
762.810
Okay, like what?
764.395
# LEONARD
765.062
I know, food fight!
767.314
768.000
**LOL**
773.821
I'll keep thinking.

# AMY
777.533
Look, I know you both
feel bad about being alone,
780.536
780.703
but sometimes the best thing you can do
is take a little time for yourself,
783.789
783.956
especially when you
just got out of a relationship.
786.333
# SHELDON
786.583
And speaking of ending relationships,
when British Honduras became Belize,
791.880
792.800
**LOL**
793.215
they designed a new flag
with a tree on it.
796.176
796.343
And I would like
to hang myself from that tree.
799.221

# RAJ
805.227
But Amy, when you and Sheldon split up
807.396
807.563
didn't you start dating
someone right away?
809.273
# AMY
810.357
Well, I wouldn't say right away.
812.234
# SHELDON
812.401
And actually, it was three different men.
814.653
815.400
**LOL**
# BARRY
815.571
Three different men?
Damn, girl, way to give the milk away!

# AMY
822.077
Aw, looks like we just lost Kripke.
824.371
# BARRY
824.788
No, actually, I'm still here.
826.228
826.200
**LOL**
# AMY
827.916
Now?
828.834

828.834
Yep.
829.752

829.918
Now?
830.586

830.586
Yep.
831.253

Now?

Aw, looks like we just lost Kripke.

# RAJ
836.925
Before Emily, I was alone for so long.
839.553
839.720
I don't know if I can do that again.
841.305
# SHELDON
841.472
Well, you know, here is something
that might cheer you up.
843.849
844.016
The flag of the Isle of Man is nothing but
847.519
847.686
three legs sharing
a weird pair of underpants.
850.272
850.439
So, you think you got problems...
853.233
853.600
**LOL**
# AMY
854.943
I have an idea.
856.653
857.529
Maybe someone in our audience
would be interested in meeting Rajesh.
861.325
861.492
Ladies, I can attest that he is a kind,
handsome, intelligent
864.953
# RAJ
865.120

Spoiled astrophysicist, who not only--
873.796
874.296
Oh, well, that was quick.

877.216
Hi, you're on Fun with Flags.
879.218
# BARRY
879.385
Hey, I think I got cut off.

# AMY
884.223
Hello, Kripke.
885.474
# BARRY
885.641
I have a flag question.
887.184
887.810
How many men did you have sex with?
889.478
890.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
893.148
Let's see, what's young and fun?
Uh, we could go dancing.
897.486
# LEONARD
897.903
Are you actually gonna dance?
899.071
# LEONARD
899.238
Well, of course.
900.281
# PENNY
900.281
Yeah, no one wants to see that.
901.323
901.900
**LOL**
902.783
Hey, how about skinny-dipping
at the beach?
904.827
# LEONARD
904.993
No, I don't need any fish
nibbling my business.
908.080
908.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
909.998
Oh, there's a screening of Moulin Rouge.
I heard the crowd sings along and stuff.
913.198
# LEONARD
913.293
That sounds fun. When's it start?
914.878
# PENNY
915.045
Midnight.
916.338
# LEONARD
916.922
Midnight, really?
918.257
919.007
You know what? Let's do it.
920.759
# PENNY
920.926
Okay, great!
922.344
923.512
Oh, wait, uh, it's sold out.

934.106
It's not terrific.
Lots of highly unlikely things happen.
936.346
936.483
You saw what's under this robe
and you still married me.
938.683
939.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
940.696
If you're really worried, we'll take him
to a vet and have him tested.
943.074
# HOWARD
943.157
Good, thank you. Okay, there is a test.
946.285
946.452
All they have to do is cut off his head
and check his brain.
950.497
# BERNADETTE
950.664
Oh, cut off his head?
That's where his little nose is.
954.209
955.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
956.462
He's not showing any symptoms.
959.256
959.548
Okay, I guess, I'll just go to
the emergency room to be safe.
962.801
# BERNADETTE
963.844
Howie, this is just your hypochondria.
965.596
# HOWARD
965.762
When I sat on the mute button
and thought I'd gone deaf,
968.015
968.182
that was my hypochondria.
969.892
974.100

# BERNADETTE
978.817
We'll find another time
to tell him I'm pregnant.

988.452
I mean, this is the first time
I've ever broken up with someone.

gonna hurt just this much.

997.085
All right.

**LOL**
1000.631
Nothing about this is fun.
1002.925
1003.926
And no one wants to talk about flags.
1006.428
1006.600

1006.595
But I haven't spoken in over 10 minutes.
1009.264

1024.988
1025.155
You know, you're not being
very sympathetic.
1026.949
1027.115
You know firsthand that breakups are hard.

# SHELDON
1031.036
Fine. If you insist on making me
a part of this, yes,
1034.540
1034.706
I acknowledge how painful they can be.
1036.667
1037.417
However, pain has an evolutionary purpose.
1041.797
1041.964
It provides information
from the environment
1044.132
1044.299
that a behavior isn't good for us.
1047.302
# BARRY
1047.469

that stripper and bought her a Prius.

Raj, now, I'm sorry you're suffering.
1060.774

When Amy and I were broken up,
I also suffered.
1063.777
1063.944
And this may sound surprising,
1066.738
1067.030
but I'm grateful
for having gone through it.

I believe our relationship now
is stronger than ever.
1076.373
# AMY
1078.166
So do I.
1079.376
# SHELDON
1079.668
When we were apart,
I learned how important you are to me.
1083.672
1083.839
And I realized that when two people
are in love, sometimes they
1087.551
1087.718
Happy Valentine's Day!

Interesting, and when
would you use the singular?
