So... couldn't help
but notice none of you RSVP'd
8.389
8.556
to my murder mystery dinner party.
10.767
# LEONARD
10.934
Oh, yeah.
We were meaning to do that.
13.478
# RAJ
13.645
No, you weren't, because it
was a week ago and nobody came!
16.856
16.800
**LOL**
18.233
So if you want to solve the mystery
of who stabbed Koothrappali
20.652
20.735
in the back with the weapon of
indifference, it was all of you.
24.030
23.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
25.114
I don't think that qualifies
as a mystery.
26.754
26.908
We all knew what we were doing.
28.451
28.700
**LOL**
# AMY
30.537
We're sorry, Rajesh.
32.038
# BERNADETTE
32.038
Maybe we can do it next week.
33.540
# HOWARD
33.706
Whoa, we're not that sorry.
35.583

# RAJ
35.750
Don't worry, I can take a hint.
No more murder mystery parties.

39.837
Thank you.
40.484
# HOWARD

even better planned!

Just hear me out.
46.052
46.219
I'm going to make you guys
a scavenger hunt
48.596
48.763
like they have at MIT.
50.056
# HOWARD
51.015
Oh, I loved those.
I did them every year there.
53.935
# LEONARD
54.102
We did them at Princeton, too.
55.123
# HOWARD
55.123
Oh, that's cute.
56.145
56.312
Like it's a real college.
57.605

**LOL**
# SHELDON
59.148
That's amusing. I was going
to say that about MIT,
61.568
61.734
but it works for Princeton, too.
63.444
63.800
**LOL**
# AMY
64.904
Scavenger hunts at Harvard
were really tough.
66.906
67.073
I always got stuck
on the first challenge.
68.908
69.075
Trying to find someone
to be on a team with me.
70.994
71.900

more sad than funny.

and I had them all the time.
80.689
# LEONARD
80.795
Oh, these are a little different.
81.922
82.005
There's a tradition
at elite universities.
84.132
# HOWARD
84.299
And Princeton.
85.675
85.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
87.010
A tradition of hunts full of puzzles
that rely on logic,
90.638
90.805
obscure knowledge, science.
92.515
# PENNY
92.682
Oh, in ours we would just run
around town looking for a store
95.184
95.351
that would sell us beer.
97.270
96.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
98.688
So, who's in?
99.939
# LEONARD

103.526
# SHELDON
103.526
I'm sorry.
104.527
104.694
Are we really doing this
or are we tricking Koothrappali again

You really think he's gonna
send us to a bowling alley?
144.517

145.401
Well, if he does, do you know how
filthy those rental balls are?
148.446
149.400

149.947
They might as well
stand on the corner

Yes, to be fair, do people who went

That's not funny.

Oh, it actually is,
if you get the joke.
237.326
236.800

It's based on the premise that
Princeton isn't a very good school.

# RAJ
246.169
Okay, guys, go ahead and divide
yourselves into teams of two.
249.088
# BERNADETTE
249.255
Should we just do couples?
250.611
# LEONARD
250.611
Couples sounds great.
251.966
252.133
Or we could mix things up.
Maybe pick names out of a hat, whatever.

# PENNY
256.429
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
259.515

Why don't you just admit you don't

I just said, "Couples sound great."

# PENNY
264.687
Mm-hmm, yeah, you don't
think I'm smart enough.
266.527
266.647
You think I'm gonna be a liability.
268.357
268.524
Even though I totally just used
the word "liability" correctly
271.152
271.319
in a sentence.
272.904
274.447
Yeah.

Hurry up and close the door
so they can't hear us.

Would you stop pouting?
So, you picked my name. Get over it.
311.943

Yes, and do you know what
the odds are I'd pick your name?

What are you doing?
You have to start with the edges.

344.725
There's no right way, Sheldon.
I already found a few pieces that fit.
347.437

Faster, faster, faster!
Do you not know that word?

That's where we have to go.
400.281
# SHELDON
400.448
But we haven't finished the puzzle.

You think you know the answer.
But it could be a trick.

What if when the puzzle's complete,
411.208
411.375
there's a sign
in the window that says,
413.127
413.294
"Go to the train store"?

# PENNY
414.962
Okay, it's not gonna say that.
416.797

Because you're in the right lane

I'm sure she finds it charming.
464.303
463.700

No, because I didn't

475.856
# BERNADETTE
476.023
Yeah, I know.
478.067
478.234
It's probably because I grew up
with five brothers and sisters
480.945
481.112
so I had to fight for every

we're involved with.
504.927

724.355
724.521
"To continue on your quest,
leave no stone unturned."
728.067
# SHELDON
728.234
The next clue must be hidden
under one of these rocks.
730.527
# PENNY
730.694
Okay.
732.613
732.780
Sheldon, I've got to ask.
733.989
734.156
How did you figure out
that it was the geology lab?
736.659
# SHELDON
736.825
Oh, simple.
737.618
737.785
The Arrah Arrah in the riddle
meant Jan Arrah,
740.704
740.871
a member of the Legion of
Superheroes known as Element Lad.
743.457
743.624
And then the word "He,"
it wasn't the masculine pronoun,
746.794
746.961
but rather, "H-E,"
the abbreviation for helium.
749.630
749.672
See where I'm going with this?
751.590
# PENNY
753.676
Yes.
755.094
755.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
755.094
Nice try.
756.512
756.679
Now, Element Lad's ability
758.847
759.014
is the power to transmute
chemical elements.
761.016
761.183
Helium has an atomic number of two.
763.602
763.769
If you multiply that by the
atomic number of nitrogen,
767.606
767.773
you get 14, which is
the atomic number of...?
772.069
774.321
I'm just funnin' you, silicon.
And that is the most common element
777.700
776.300
**LOL**
777.866
in the Earth's surface.
So that narrowed it down
779.952
780.119
to the geology lab
or the chemistry lab.
782.037
# PENNY
782.204
Wow.
784.415
784.581
I can drink a beer underwater.
786.834

# SHELDON
788.043
And I'm sure your parents are proud.
789.878
790.500
**LOL**
790.045
Now, finally, the line
"in this room the thing you'll see"
794.383
794.550
was an obvious reference
to Fantastic Four member The Thing,
797.636
797.803
who's made entirely of--
799.680
# PENNY
799.680
Shut up. I solved it!
801.557
# SHELDON
805.853
Those are map coordinates.
808.022
808.188
Got 'em. Let's go.

868.707
# LEONARD
868.874
Why?

She's been known to call you a name
that usually applies to a lady part.

Or a cat.

Or a willow.
