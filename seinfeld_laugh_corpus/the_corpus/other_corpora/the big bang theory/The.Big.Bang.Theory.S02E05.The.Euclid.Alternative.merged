# SHELDON

We have to stop by Pottery Barn...
16.684
16.851
...on the way to work.
I bought these Star Wars sheets.
20.187
20.700
**LOL**
20.354
They turned out to be much too stimulating
to be compatible with a good night's sleep.
24.984
24.300
**LOL**
26.736
I don't like the way
Darth Vader stares at me.

# LEONARD

I'm not going to work.

Just because your career's been stagnant for
a few years, that's no reason to give up.
36.746

# LEONARD
37.204
Sheldon, I was up all night
using the new free-electron laser...
40.541
40.708
...for my x-ray-diffraction experiment.
42.793
# SHELDON
42.960
Did the laser accidentally
burn out your retinas?
45.796
# LEONARD
46.213
No.
47.465
# SHELDON
47.465
Then you can drive. Let's go.
48.716
48.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
51.135
Didn't I tell you I'd be working nights and
you'd have to make other arrangements?
55.264
# SHELDON
55.431
You did.
56.056
# LEONARD
56.056
And?
56.682
# SHELDON
56.849
I didn't.
58.643
58.600
**LOL**
59.560
Let's go.
60.853
# LEONARD
61.896
Good night, Sheldon.
62.938
# SHELDON
63.105
But how am I going to get to work?
64.481
# LEONARD
64.481
Take the bus.
65.858
# SHELDON
66.025
But I can't take the bus.
They don't have seat belts.
68.444
68.611
And they won't let you lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords.
71.947
72.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
72.406
You tried to lash yourself
to the seat with bungee cords?
75.242
# SHELDON
75.409
I didn't try, I succeeded.
77.995
77.700
**LOL**
78.746
But for some reason, it alarmed the other
passengers and I was asked to de-bus.
82.792
82.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
82.958
Oh, you're a big boy. You'll figure it out.
85.628
# SHELDON
85.795
Don't talk to me like I'm a child.
87.630
87.797
Now take me
to return my Star Wars sheets.

No, wait.
107.108
107.316
You have to drive me to work.
108.901
# PENNY
109.443
Yeah, I really don't think I do.
112.113
112.300

# SHELDON
112.613
But I don't drive

You'll be fine as long as
you don't do that bungee thing.

Penny.
119.412
120.621
Didn't you recently state
that you and I are friends?
123.499
# PENNY
124.750
Yes, Sheldon, we are friends.
127.628
# SHELDON
127.795
Then I hereby invoke
what I'm given to understand...
130.423
130.589
...is an integral part
of the implied covenant of friendship.
133.968
133.900

137.805
The favor.

179.263
You know this is my day off, Sheldon?
181.056
# SHELDON
181.223
Oh, good,
I'm not keeping you from anything.
183.684
184.100
**LOL**
187.146
Your check-engine light is on.
188.501
# PENNY
188.501
Mm-hm.
189.857
# SHELDON
190.983
Typically that's an indicator to,
you know, check your engine.
194.612
# PENNY
194.779
It's fine. It's been on for like a month.
197.573
198.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
198.491
Well, actually, that would be all the more
reason to, you know, check your engine.
202.745
203.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
203.579
Sheldon, it's fine.
205.310
# SHELDON
205.310
If it were fine, the light wouldn't be on.
207.041
207.208
That's why the manufacturer installed
that light, to let you know it's not fine.
211.086
211.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
211.253
Maybe the light's broken.
212.963
# SHELDON
214.215
Is there
a check-the-check-engine-light light?
217.218
216.500
**LOL**
218.719
Oh.
219.887
# PENNY
220.304
What?
221.597
# SHELDON
221.764
Studies have shown that performing tasks
such as eating, talking on a phone...
225.392
225.559
...or drinking coffee while driving
reduces one's reaction time...
228.479
228.646
...by the same factor
as an ounce of alcohol.
230.731
# PENNY
230.898
Do you have any alcohol?
232.170
# SHELDON
232.170
Of course not.
233.442
# PENNY
233.609
Too bad.
235.569
235.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
238.072
You're going up Euclid Avenue?
239.657
# PENNY
239.657
Mm-hm.
241.242
# SHELDON
241.408
Leonard takes Los Robles Avenue.
243.077
# PENNY
243.244
Well, good for Leonard.
244.870
# SHELDON
245.037
Euclid Avenue is shorter as the crow flies,
but it has speed bumps...
248.582
248.749
...which increase point-to-point drive
time, making it the less efficient choice.
252.795
254.839
But you have the con.
256.298
256.600
**LOL**
257.800
Oh!
259.260
260.344
If you're not going to slow down for
the speed bumps, I withdraw my objection.
264.765
264.100
**LOL**
266.559
Here's a fun question.
268.102
268.269
Do you know
what the most common street name is?
270.813
# PENNY
270.980
No.
272.252
# SHELDON
272.252
The answer's tricky.
273.524
273.200
**LOL**
274.608
It's Second Street.
275.776
275.943
You'd think it would be First Street.
277.653
277.820
In most towns, First Street eventually
gets renamed to something else.
281.156
281.323
Like Main Street...
282.867
283.033
...Broad Street...
284.368
284.535
...Michigan Avenue.
286.620
286.500
**LOL**
286.787
Leonard and I
often use our commute time...
288.539
288.706
...to exercise our minds
with brain teasers like that.
291.333
291.792
We also play games.
294.128
295.337
Would you like to play one?
296.630
296.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
297.047
No.
298.111
# SHELDON
298.111
Oh, come on, it's fun.
299.174
299.967
Whoo! Another bump.
302.177
301.700
**LOL**
303.637
Okay. Uh, I'll say an element
and, uh, you say an element...
307.141
307.308
...whose name starts with the last
letter of the one I said, okay?
310.811
311.979
I'll start.
313.022
313.700
**LOL**
314.648
"Helium."
316.317
319.653
Now, you could say, "Mercury."
321.822
321.989
That would give me a Y.
323.532
323.699
Ooh, very clever. That's a tough one.
326.327
325.800
**LOL**
326.869
So I go with "ytterbium"...
328.162
328.329
...which gets you back to M.
329.872
330.039
So you go, "Molybdenum."
331.665
331.832
And I say, "Magnesium."
333.834
334.001
And you say, "Manganese."
335.294
335.461
And I say, "Europium."
337.254
# PENNY
337.421
And you're left with "mendelevium."
339.048
339.214
And there are no more M's,
because I believe that meitnerium...
342.176
342.343
...should still be called eka-iridium.
So congratulations, you win.
346.263
345.800
**LOL**
351.018
Do you wanna go again?
352.853
352.200

a little quiet time now?

356.482
All right.

360.600
**LOL**
363.072
I'm sorry.
I'm finding your reckless nonchalance...
365.449
365.616
...regarding the check-engine light
to be very troubling.
368.285
372.414
Get out.
373.958
374.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
375.250
I have to tell you that while I do have
a theoretical understanding...
378.504
378.671
...of an internal-combustion engine...
380.422
380.589
...I'm not sure
I'm capable of performing diagnostics.

Does it say, "I give a damn"?

That's because I don't.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
742.743
Just look.
See, this first question makes no sense.
745.537
745.704
Look, "How many oar lengths should you
leave in front of you when driving?"
749.333
749.499
There's no possible way to answer that.
751.710
751.800

751.877
A car length is not
a standardized unit of measure.

# HOWARD

Sheldon,
why are you arguing with the DMV?
770.979
# SHELDON
771.146
How else are they going to learn?
773.482
773.600
**LOL**
775.150
Look, question
777.110
777.277
"When are roadways most slippery?"
779.529
779.696
There are three answers,
none of which are correct.
782.074
782.240
The correct answer is, "When covered by liquid
sufficient to reduce the coefficient...
786.286
783.500
**LOL**
786.453
...to static friction between the tire
and the road to zero.
789.206
788.100
**LOL**
789.373
But not so deep as to introduce
a new source of friction."

Statistically, red cars...

...are stopped by police
far more often than any other color.

But I am convinced
that the reason I cannot master...

a stopped school bus on a country road.
