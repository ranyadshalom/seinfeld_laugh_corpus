I recently read that during World War ll...
6.382
6.549
...Joseph Stalin had a research program
to create super soldiers...
9.969
10.136
...by having women impregnated by gorillas.
13.681
14.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
14.933
What a sick use of science.
16.768
# RAJ
16.935
Hey, as long as the baby's healthy.
19.395
19.900
**LOL**
# AMY
20.605
I wonder if Stalin considered
any other animals.
23.274
# LEONARD
23.441
Hippos are the deadliest creature.
25.109
25.276
A half-human, half-hippo soldier
would be pretty badass.
28.238
29.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
29.614
Yes, but when they're hungry, hungry,
you can stop them with marbles.
33.284
33.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
34.285
Yeah, the correct animal
for interspecies super soldier is koala.
38.540
38.706
You would wind up with an army so cute,
it couldn't be attacked.
42.877
42.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
43.962
But half-man, half-owl can fly
46.464
# SHELDON
46.631
The answer is cuddly soldiers
with big flat noses. Moving on.
50.385
50.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
51.844
So, Penny, when's the new job start?
53.137
# PENNY
53.137
Next Monday.
54.430
# BERNADETTE
54.597
Did you look over the materials I gave you?
56.808
# PENNY
56.975
Uh, not yet, but I will.
58.539
# BERNADETTE
58.539
Great. When?
60.103
# PENNY
60.770
I said I'll get to it.
62.105
# SHELDON
66.484
I'm sensing awkwardness. Am I right?
69.028
# AMY
69.195
Yes.
70.738
# SHELDON
71.155
Swish.
72.657
72.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
75.243
I don't want to be pushy, but you've
never done pharmaceutical sales before.
78.955
79.122
You could use this time
to get a head start.
81.457
# PENNY
81.624
The first few weeks will be training.
They'll tell me everything I need to know.
85.420
# BERNADETTE
85.587
Imagine how impressed they'd be if you
showed up familiar with the material.
89.132
# PENNY
89.299
So, what, you want me
to be like a teacher's pet?
91.634
# BERNADETTE
91.801
Couldn't hurt.
93.136
93.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
93.303
I don't know. Who here has ever been hurt
because they were the teacher's pet?
97.348
99.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
101.853
It's like the rest of the class
wanted Ms. McDonald to forget the quiz.
105.898

**LOL**
# SHELDON
132.550
Mrs. Davis...
134.010
134.177
...guess who.
135.240
# MRSDAVIS
135.240
Dr. Cooper.
136.304
# SHELDON
136.846
That's right. Good job.
138.389
138.900
**LOL**
140.099
Hello. Uh...
141.893
142.060
You wanted to see me?
143.227
# MRSDAVIS
143.394
Yes, welcome back.
144.645
# SHELDON
144.645
Thank you.
145.897
146.064
I assume you'd like to
reopen our dialogue...
148.524
148.691
...about the university forcing me
to continue with string theory?
151.736
# MRSDAVIS
151.903
You mean the dialogue that went,
"Please. No. Please. No. Please. No."?
156.699
# SHELDON
158.117
That's the one.
159.702
159.400
**LOL**
160.662
I believe you went last, so please?
164.582
164.500
**LOL**
# MRSDAVIS
164.749
Dr. Cooper, while you were away...
166.584
166.751
...we came up with a solution that would
allow you to change your field of study.
170.713
# SHELDON
170.880
Wow.
172.215
172.382
Pouting and running away actually worked.
175.385
175.500
**LOL**
176.052
I must say that may not be a lesson
you want to reinforce with me.
179.597
179.700
**LOL**
180.473
So, um, what is the solution?
183.476
# MRSDAVIS
183.643
Currently, you're being paid under a grant
to specifically research string theory.
187.522
187.689
If we promote you to junior professor,
you'll be able to choose...
190.858
191.025
...whatever field of research you'd like.
193.194
# SHELDON
193.861
But if I'm a professor...
195.947
196.114
...then I'll have to teach a class.
197.636
# MRSDAVIS
197.636
That is correct.
199.158
# SHELDON
200.660
So your solution is to promote me...
203.496
203.663
...and pay me more money...
205.206
205.373
...so that I can impart my knowledge
to the next generation of scientists?
209.252
# MRSDAVIS
209.419
Yes.
210.461
# SHELDON
211.838
You people are sick.

# AMY
220.638
Give me a minute. I'm stimulating
the pleasure cells of this starfish.
223.891
224.058
I need to turn it off.
225.142
# PENNY
225.142
What if you don't?
226.227
# AMY
226.394
I have to sit through lunch knowing this
starfish is having a better day than I am.
230.231
230.100
**LOL**
232.191
Is Bernadette meeting us at the restaurant?
234.652
# PENNY
234.819
No, actually, I didn't invite her.
236.362
# AMY
236.362
How come?
237.905
# PENNY
238.448
Ever since she helped me get this job,
she won't stop bugging me.
241.492
# AMY
241.659
Well, I think she just wants you to do well
and she's worried you won't...
245.163
245.329
...because you were just
a stunningly poor waitress.
249.208
249.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
249.917
That is not true.
251.085

I'm still waiting on my mini corn dogs
from two years ago.
254.881

I told you they'll be right out.
258.217
258.400

# AMY
259.510
Okay, so no Bernadette.
261.512
# PENNY
261.679
Well, you saw her the other night.
Am I wrong?
264.348
# AMY
264.515
No, I just
265.683
265.850
I feel kind of uncomfortable talking
about her like this.
268.561
268.728
Usually when someone's
being talked about behind their back...
271.606
271.773
...it's me and it's right
in front of my face.
274.317
274.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
275.443
I'm sorry. I just need a little break from her.
277.591
# AMY
277.591
I understand.
279.739
279.906
You know...
281.491
281.657
...there is some research that indicates...
283.701
283.868
...that sharing negative attitudes
about a third party...
286.579
286.746
...can be a powerful bonding force
between two friends.
290.666
290.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
291.459
So, what are you saying?
293.399
# AMY
293.399
I'm saying, in the spirit of science...
295.338
295.505
...what is that little skank's problem?

Awful. They're allowing me

331.457
331.624
...but they made me a junior professor

335.545

335.711
I don't understand.
Why is it bad you have to teach?

Wrong.

It is true that many of my heroes

That's rich. Heh-heh.

# BERNADETTE
435.603
Not tonight. I'm a little frustrated with her.
437.188
# AMY
437.355
Because you got her the job, and she
should be working harder to prepare?
440.900

...this could reflect poorly on you.
465.383

Exactly. Does she not realize it?
Or does she not care?
468.552
# AMY
468.719
I don't know.
470.054
470.221
The important thing is,
I am here for you...

Oh, yes.
520.104
520.271
Fig Newtons. I was going to ask them...
522.440
522.606
...which scientist both helped
to develop calculus...
525.276
525.443
...and had a famous cookie named after him.
527.737
527.903
Then after someone said Newton,
I was going to tell them they're wrong.
531.323
532.000
**LOL**
532.658
The cookies are named
after a town in Massachusetts.

# SHELDON
580.581
How would you determine the ground state
of a quantum system with no exact solution?
585.795
# HOWARD
585.961
Guess a wave function and vary its parameters
until I found the lowest energy solution.
590.007
# SHELDON
590.674
Hmm.
592.009
592.400
**LOL**
593.385
Do you know how to integrate X squared times
E to the minus X without looking it up?
597.807
# HOWARD
598.682
I'd use Feynman's trick,
differentiate under the integral sign.
601.769
# SHELDON
601.936
Okay.
603.979
604.300
**LOL**

Uh...
606.524
606.690
What is the correct interpretation
of quantum mechanics?
610.319
# HOWARD
610.486
Every interpretation gives the same answer
to every measurement. They're all correct.
614.490
614.657
You believe in the many worlds
interpretation, so I'll say that.
617.493

Now do you think I'm smart enough?

I'm working on my lesson plan for Wolowitz.
691.025
691.192
He is going to be so lost.
692.776
693.600
**LOL**
694.195
Look at this section over here.
696.030
696.197
Even I don't really understand it.
698.908
698.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
699.867
Sheldon, why are you doing this?
702.244
# SHELDON
702.745
I'm a teacher, Leonard. It's my job.
705.331
705.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
706.624
No, why are you going to so much trouble
to prove that you're smarter than Wolowitz?
710.794
# SHELDON
710.961
Oh, it's no trouble. It's
actually a pleasure.
713.839
713.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
715.299
Wanna know what I think?
716.884
717.051
I think the idea that someone could be
as smart as you or even smarter...
721.096
721.263
...scares the pants off you,
and you can't deal with it.
724.141
# SHELDON
726.393
Interesting point.
727.978
728.520
But you're suggesting that I have emotional
issues below my consciousness...
732.399
732.566
...which drive my behavior.
733.984
734.151
Thus causing me to lash out
at anything or anyone...
736.987
737.154
...that threatens my
intellectual superiority.
739.740
# LEONARD
740.532
Might be something to think about.
742.159
# SHELDON
744.245
Leonard.
745.204
# LEONARD
745.204
Yeah.
746.163
# SHELDON
746.330
Howard's allergic to peanuts.
How can I use that against him?
749.708
749.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
754.672
Hey.
755.881
# SHELDON
756.048
Okay, now that everyone's here,
we can begin.
759.009
759.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
761.553
Before we do, I just talked to Leonard.
763.681
763.847
And, heh, if you're gonna spend
all your time trying to belittle me...
767.518
767.685
...by making this class unnecessarily hard,
then I'm out.
772.398
772.564
If you're interested in making
a sincere effort to be a good teacher...
776.193
773.900
**LOL**
776.360
...then I'm willing to give this a shot.
779.196
# SHELDON
781.907
I suppose that's a fair request.
784.201
784.368
There's no reason we both can't benefit
from this experience.
787.913
# HOWARD
788.539
Okay.
789.790
# SHELDON
789.790
Okay.
791.041
792.084
Well, then, first things first.
794.420
794.586
Are you familiar
with the Brachistochrone Problem?
797.131
# HOWARD
797.298
I am.
797.944
# SHELDON
797.944
Good.
798.590
798.757
And how it relates
to the calculus of variations?
801.051
# HOWARD
801.218
It's an inverted cycloid.
802.240
# SHELDON
802.240
Wonderful.
803.262
803.429
Now what about Euler-Lagrange theorems?
805.347
# HOWARD
805.347
That's where I'm a little fuzzy.
807.266
# SHELDON
807.433
Ha! I knew it. All right. Now.
810.060
809.500
**LOL**
810.477
We have a lot of information
to cover before your first test.
813.731
813.897
Which, by the way, is in eight minutes.
816.650
816.600
**LOL**
816.817
The good news is I'm grading on a curve,
so you're pretty much guaranteed a C.
822.072
821.600

All I do is win, win, win, no matter what

What are you doing?
825.743
825.909
Everybody's hands go up, up
828.120
828.287
And they stay there
829.997

**LOL**
# SHELDON
830.164
What are you doing?
831.603
# HOWARD
831.603
If you're gonna be a crappy teacher...
833.042
833.208
...then I'm gonna be a crappy student.
835.085
835.252
Ungh, ungh, Ludacris going in on the verse

Stop it.
840.341

This is a classroom.
This is not American Bandstand.
844.303
# HOWARD
# SHELDON
844.470
Okay, now where was I?
Let's see. Oh, yes, over here.
849.350
845.100
**LOL**
851.226
What are you doing now?
852.436
# HOWARD
852.603
I'm making a straw.
854.271
854.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
854.438
Why?
856.461
# HOWARD
856.461
So I can shoot you with a spitball.
858.484
858.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
860.110
You're not going to do that,
and I'll tell you why.
862.780
862.946
This is an institution of higher learning.
864.865
865.199
I am your professor, and you're
going to treat me with the prop
868.452
869.500
**LOL**
874.041
You shot your spit in my mouth.
877.002
876.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
878.253
Is that gonna be on the test?
Because I don't think I can do that again.
881.757
881.800
**LOL**
885.636
Hey, girlfriend. Can I get a "what what"?
889.306
# PENNY

**LOL**
# AMY
892.768
Close enough. Um...
894.520
894.686
I was just calling
to see what you were up to.
896.647
896.814
Thought maybe we could hit up Color Me Mine.
Maybe sneak in some pinot Gris? Whatevs.
902.152

# PENNY
902.319
Oh, thanks, but I'm gonna stay in
and go over the stuff Bernadette gave me.

# AMY
906.073
Oh.
907.074
907.241
Oh, I hear you.
Try and get that nag off your back, right?
910.327
910.300

911.120
I mean, you're not a bicycle.
Why she riding you like that?
914.998

916.041
I think she was just trying to help.
Plus, I really want to do well at this job.

# AMY
920.087
Okay, good luck, and call me later.
921.797

she's a bitch or something.

Maybe we sneak in some pinot.
Make it Color Me Wine.

# BERNADETTE
939.565
That sounds fun, but I promised Penny
I'd come by and help her study.
942.818
# AMY
942.985
Oh, well, good luck getting her to do that.
She's probably out getting another manicure.
948.574
947.900
**LOL**
948.740
You remember when she did that?
You remember?
951.869
951.900
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
952.619
I was probably being too hard on her.
We talked. We're good.
955.706
# AMY
955.873
Oh, great. I'm happy for you guys.
958.876
959.042
When the two of you aren't getting along,
it puts me in a really weird position.
963.213

Don't worry. Everything's back to normal.

I told you, you weren't smart enough
to take it.
1013.764
# HOWARD
1013.931
I'm smart enough. Asking me about a topic I'm
not familiar with doesn't prove anything.
1017.976
1018.143
I could do the same to you.
1019.937
