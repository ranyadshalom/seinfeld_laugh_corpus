# LEONARD

I don't know. Tomorrow morning?
7.300
# PENNY

Don't you want to know for sure?

# LEONARD

As soon as she flies
into California airspace...
11.304
11.513
...I'll feel a disturbance in the Force.
14.349

# AMY

It's so nice both of your moms are
coming in to see you guys get an award.
18.728
# SHELDON
19.312
Well, my mother's been there
for every honor I've won...
21.856
22.065
...since I beat out my twin sister
for the "Did It On The Potty" trophy.
25.401
26.300
**LOL**
27.320
How does this look?
28.634
# PENNY
28.634
Aw, it's so nice. She's gonna love it.
29.948
# AMY
30.490
Sure, his morn gets roses.
32.242
32.450
When I want them they're a
"bouquet of severed plant genitals."
36.246

**LOL**
# SHELDON
37.664
You act like I didn't get you
that mushroom log on Valentine's Day.
41.167
41.200
**LOL**
# AMY
41.834
He's right, roses die,
but a moist, rotting log...
44.963
45.171
...will pump out mushrooms
for two or three magical years.
48.758
48.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
48.925
Your mom's never been thrilled
with our relationship.
51.344
51.511
Maybe I should get her something
so she warms up to me.
54.055
# LEONARD
54.222
If you could run out and get a PhD,
that might make her like you.
57.976

Really? It didn't work for you.
59.352

Mm-hm.
60.520
61.563
Think the moms will get along?
63.085
# LEONARD
63.085
They're pretty different.
64.607
# SHELDON
64.774
Maybe they'll be best friends.
66.484
66.693
One of them is brilliant.
One is sweet and simple.
69.404

Sound familiar?

Thank you, Mother.
103.083
# MRSCOOPER
103.083
I tried to read your paper...
104.230
104.397
...but it was very hard
for me to understand.
106.858
# SHELDON
107.066
It's quite straight-forward, actually.
108.860
109.068
It describes a new model of
the universe that conceptualizes it...
112.822
113.031
...as the surface of
an n-dimensional superfluid.
115.283
# MRSCOOPER
115.491
Interesting. You can believe that...
117.243
117.452
...but God filling an Ark with
animals two-by-two is nonsense.
123.291
123.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
124.208
What did they feed the lions, Mother?

The floating bodies
of drowned sinners, of course.

# SHELDON
135.386
Listen, Leonard's mom is a renowned
psychiatrist and woman of science.
141.059
141.267
Can you please keep the Bible babble
to yourself while she's here?
145.229
# MRSCOOPER
145.438
Are you ashamed of me?
147.356
# SHELDON
147.356
Of course not, I love you.
149.275
149.484
I'm just embarrassed by
the things you believe, do and say.

No, we're kind of taking it slow.

I see.

# LEONARD

# DRHOFSTADTER
177.845
You've been on and off
with this woman for seven years...
180.640
180.848
...and engaged for one year.
One has to wonder if there's a problem.
184.811
185.019
Are you having satisfactory intercourse?
188.064
187.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
190.316
Yes, Mother.
192.360
# DRHOFSTADTER
193.945
Only satisfactory, I see.
197.031
197.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
199.033
I change my answer. It's amazing, it's hot.
202.412

We can barely keep
our hands off each other.
205.540

# DRHOFSTADTER
206.290
Seems odd to try and impress
your mother with your sexual prowess.
211.170
210.700
**LOL**
211.671
But then you always did have
that unresolved Oedipal complex.

# LEONARD
216.092
See, this right here, what you're doing...
218.052
218.261
...can you please not do that
around Sheldon's mom?
220.930
# DRHOFSTADTER
221.139
Why, are you attracted to her too?
223.891
224.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
224.559
Of course not. She's just
a very sweet and God-fearing lady...
228.646
228.813
...and you have to be
respectful of her beliefs.
231.023
# DRHOFSTADTER
231.190
Leonard, I'm an adult,
I know how to conduct myself...
233.901
234.110
...around people
from different walks of life.

We just spent two hours in traffic.

that you liked our paper?
260.178
260.200
**LOL**
# DRHOFSTADTER
260.386
Of course I did. But it's a mother's job
to make sure her child's self-esteem...
264.056
264.265
...is not dependent on anyone's approval.
266.309

First thing you have to know
about Shelly is, since he was little...
370.580
370.746
...he was always concerned
with the well-being of others.
374.333
376.000
**LOL**
377.253
And he didn't think that it was fair
for people to pay for electricity...
380.631
380.840
...so he was gonna power
the entire town for free.

When he arranged to
get some yellow cake from Chad...

...I thought he was talking about
Twinkies from one of his friends.
397.356
397.400

Yes, and we'll get back to that.

Even with your mother here...
583.542
583.709
...you're deliberately hogging
all the attention from my morn.
586.545
586.796
You're like those elephant seal pups...

...that steals the milk from two mothers.

# SHELDON

Well, now I have to correct you.
604.313
604.522
As a bit of an elephant seal buff...
607.233
607.483
...the more accurate comparison
would be when two mother seals...
610.945
608.100
**LOL**
611.153
...actively seek to nourish the same pup.
613.322
613.531
So I believe the term you're looking for...

615.741
...is a "double mother suckler."

You're right.
That is the term I'm looking for.

At least the bearded man that I believe in
preaches love and compassion.
689.607
689.815
All yours talks about is
why you hold in your poop...
692.359
692.568
...and wanna crawl back inside your mama.
695.446

It's fascinating. How can someone
as enlightened as Sheldon...
701.869

...come from someone like you?

I know the answer, you're
not gonna like it.

When I was pregnant with Shelly...
711.754
711.962
...l was driving to church,
and I was praying to the Lord...
714.882
715.090
...to give me a son
smarter than his dumb-ass daddy.
718.344
718.700
**LOL**
719.261
And I looked over
and I saw a Jesus bobblehead...
722.514
722.723
...in the Subaru next to me nodding "Yes."

What is that supposed to mean?
734.693
# DRHOFSTADTER

It means I can't believe
we're having this conversation.

Well, do it some more.

Maybe you can knock
some sense into yourself.
743.494

# PENNY
743.702
How about we all stop hitting ourselves...
745.746
745.955
...and talk about
something safe like shoes...
748.207
748.415
...or how cute little Chinese babies are.

Bernadette's not wrong.
She does work hard around here.
777.569
# RAJ
777.778
Yeah, maybe it's a good thing
if she stops babying you so much.
780.698
# HOWARD

She doesn't baby me.

Face it, dude, Bernadette treats you
the same way your mother used to...
795.045
795.254
...and that was not a healthy relationship.
797.423
# HOWARD
800.009
You're right, it's time for me...
803.137
803.345
...to act like an adult in this marriage.
806.432
806.640
Starting with my husbandly duty...
809.268
809.476
...of taking out the trash.
812.521

It's all right, she'll forgive you.
828.120
828.329
She has to or she goes to hell.
831.540
831.400
**LOL**
# DRHOFSTADTER
834.209
I can't help but notice
how her unconditional love for you...
838.047
838.255
...is diametrically opposed
to my own parenting strategies.
841.884
# SHELDON
842.092
Well, you doled out affection
as a reward for achievement...
847.514
847.723
...a proven way to
raise a child or train a rat.
852.061
851.700
**LOL**
# DRHOFSTADTER
852.686
But look how well you turned out.
854.438
# SHELDON
854.646
I'd feign modesty at this point,
but who would believe me?
858.484
858.200
**LOL**
858.901
Still, you need to consider how successful
Leonard's brother and sister are.
863.280
# DRHOFSTADTER
863.489
I suppose.
865.074
# SHELDON
865.282
While my brother and sister
are mouth-breathing idiots.
869.161
868.800
**LOL**
# DRHOFSTADTER
869.703
Do you suppose
you would've flourished more...
871.830
871.997
...in a reward-based environment?
873.665
# SHELDON
874.958
Perhaps. But my morn made me
spaghetti with chopped-up hot dogs...
878.837
879.046
...whenever I wanted, so who cares?
881.799

# LEONARD
884.176
Not once did my mother
ever give me any love or affection...
887.679
887.888
...for just being myself.
I always had to earn it.

# MRSCOOPER
890.391
Oh, Leonard, I'm sure
she loves you very much.
893.227

In her own cold, godless way.
896.855
896.500

# PENNY

Yeah, and you certainly
don't have to earn my love.

# PENNY
902.048
Of course, you already knew that...

903.362
...when you bought me this
princess-cut drill bit.

When your mom gets back,
I need to apologize...
916.583
916.750
...for the way I spoke to her.

# PENNY
918.377
Come on, she did kind of start it.
920.129
# MRSCOOPER
920.337
A good Christian would've
turned the other cheek.
923.048
923.257
On the other hand,
a good Texan would've shot her, so...

I kind of split the difference.

Yes, I cleaned it up all by myself.

Leonard, I always
made you earn my affection...

...but today I realized that there's
more than one way to raise a child.

initiate a new protocol...
