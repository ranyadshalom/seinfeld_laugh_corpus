those pointy hats in the air.

I look sad.

All right.
202.036
# HOWARD
202.245
Step one. Rapidly flip the calibration
switch from the fully up...
205.540
205.748
...to the fully down position
for at least 10 times.
208.751
# SHELDON
209.877
It actually says "at least"?

# HOWARD
211.379
Yeah.
212.880
213.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
213.089
Why would they say "at least"?
214.590
214.799
Is it 10 toggles?
ls it a hundred toggles, you know?
218.094
218.200

Is it a thousand toggles?

Just flip the switch until the lights
on the drone change to solid yellow.
232.608

That seems simple enough.
234.736
234.944
Initiating calibration sequence.

six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
243.536
245.300

246.164
Well, I suppose 10
is technically "at least 10."
249.500

But they're still getting
at least one angry letter.
254.255

Now I rotate it horizontally...
258.843

**LOL**
273.524
What does red and yellow mean?
274.942
# HOWARD
275.109
It means the calibration failed.
We have to start over.

I'm gonna go put on pants just in case.
But I have to say, this is very freeing.

Okay, I think I've narrowed it down

Very impressive.

Sorry. Yeah, maybe it's for the best.
696.280

I hear locomotive smoke
is the second leading cause...

718.677
# HOWARD
718.844
It's not about the money.
720.012
720.179
It's about solving a problem.
It's why I became an engineer.
722.973
723.140
It's what I like to do,
it's what I'm trained to do, it's who I am.

The little engineer that could.

There's two kinds of people in this world.
739.073
739.281
Those who call tech support...
740.658

...and those who make fun of the people
who call tech support.

Members of the faculty, students...
766.517
766.684
...I'm excited to speak to you today.
769.144
769.353
I can't help but remember the last time
I was in this auditorium.
772.356
772.564
Two guys from the lacrosse team
played keep away with my asthma inhaler.
777.152
777.300
**LOL**
777.361
But enough about my 10-year reunion.
780.739
780.800

782.199
I'd also like to take a moment
to thank my beautiful fiancֳ©e...
785.369

...for helping to make this speech possible,
even though weather nearly prevented it.

Nothing, I was just calling to check in,
make sure she's doing okay.
866.367
# DRKOOTHRAPALLI

Well, after talking to you, she seems
to think I'm some sort of playboy.

Really? I don't know where
she'd get an idea like that.

You know Mommy
and her crazy imagination.

It was L. Frank Baum who
901.402
901.652
"No thief, however skillful...
904.154
904.363
mean rob one of knowledge...
906.281
906.490
...and that is why knowledge
is the best and safest treasure..."
911.328
911.537
Wow, I'm boring myself.
914.498
914.800
**LOL**
917.376
Sorry, I can't see any
of your faces right now...
919.670
919.837
...but I bet they look like this...
922.089
922.700
**LOL**
925.384
Uh, heh. You know,
I wrote an entire speech...
929.513
929.721
...to say how high school prepares you...
931.682
931.890
...and what a wonderful place it is...
934.560
934.768
...but I hated it.
937.187
937.396
Maybe high school's great
if you look like this...
940.899
941.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
942.526
But I didn't even feel like I existed
at that school.
946.697
947.281
And now that I think about it...
949.074
949.283
...l bet a lot of you feel the same way.
951.368
951.577
So for the remainder of my speech...
955.372
956.206
...this is for the invisible kids.
958.834
959.001
Uh, maybe you never fit in...
961.795
962.004
...or maybe you're
the smallest kid in school...
964.214
964.381
...or the heaviest or the weirdest.
966.425
966.633
Maybe you're graduating
and still haven't had your first kiss
970.012
970.220
By the way, 19...
972.222
972.389
...and Geraldine Coco,
wherever you are, thank you.
975.476
976.600

977.769
Maybe you don't have any friends.
979.396
979.605
And guess what. That's okay.
982.232
982.441

My point is...
993.035
993.202
...while you're spending
time on your own...
995.329
995.496
...building computers
or practicing your cello...
999.166
999.374
...what you're really doing
is becoming interesting.
1003.086
1003.420
And when people finally do notice you...
1006.006
1006.256
...they're gonna find someone
a lot cooler than they thought.
1009.426
1009.635
And for those of you who were popular
in high school, it's over. Sorry.
