Oh, look, it's the Scientific American
that covered the paper Leonard and I wrote.
20.688
# AMY
20.855
Oh, let me see.
22.524
# SHELDON
22.690
I have mixed feelings
about doing interviews.
25.360
25.527
I like the part where I talk.
27.237
27.403
I do not like the part
where the other man talks.
30.448
30.300
**LOL**
# AMY
32.408
Sheldon, this article
doesn't mention Leonard at all.
35.745
# SHELDON
35.912
Oh, that can't be right.
37.413
# AMY
37.580
It only refers to "Dr. Cooper and his
team." Did you even talk about him?
41.751
# SHELDON
41.918
All I did was answer
a few questions about the theory.
44.420
44.587
Then expressed my gratitude
that Scientific American...
47.090
47.257
...doesn't include
any of those smelly perfume cards.
50.218
50.100
**LOL**
# AMY
51.219
Poor Leonard.
52.762
# SHELDON
52.929
Why? The theory he came up with
just got mentioned in Scientific American.
57.267
57.433
He ought to be thrilled.
58.601
# AMY
58.601
He might not be.
59.769
# SHELDON
59.936
Oh, maybe you're right.
61.771
62.105
He is kind of a lump.
63.982

**LOL**
# AMY
64.732
Think about it. How would you feel if you
were referred to as part of Leonard's team?
68.903
# SHELDON
69.070
Oh, I'd be incensed.

Leonard is as much a part of this paper
as you are, and he was overlooked.
89.465

He's going to feel bad.
91.509
# SHELDON
91.676
But it wasn't my fault.
93.428

I didn't exclude him,

Remember when you didn't get picked

My uncle was a worshipper of Krishna.
158.326

A statue of Shiva.

Is that why you couldn't get rid of

Yes. It reminds me of us eating out...

And your name is on the electric bill
and mine isn't.
217.051

237.029
# LEONARD
237.405
What's going on?
238.448
# SHELDON
239.574
An article was just published
in Scientific American about our theory.
243.870
# LEONARD
244.537
Did they hate it?
246.143
# SHELDON
246.143
No. No, they loved it.
247.749
247.957
They couldn't say enough nice things
about it.
250.168
# LEONARD
250.960
So, what's the problem?
252.545

You should know,
I had nothing to do with that.

# LEONARD
298.633
Uh...

At least they're talking about the theory.

# SHELDON
305.723
You know, you're right.
307.433
307.600
Yeah. You know, it's like when Stan Lee
and Steve Ditko created Spider-Man.
312.063
312.230
Stan Lee may get all the credit...
314.106
314.273
...but Steve Ditko knows
he was just as important.
316.901
317.068
Even though Stan Lee
gets to be in all the Marvel movies.
319.737
320.154
And he's far richer.
321.447
322.281
And he's a household name, you know...
323.991
324.400
**LOL**
324.158
...whereas, you know, you say "Ditko,"
that sounds like a company that makes dits.

# RAJ
404.196
You don't want to do that.
405.531
405.698
Refreezing not only removes moisture,
but it creates ice crystals...
408.409
408.576
...in the fibers of the meat
that can compromise its taste and texture.

Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter
said he's been following my work for a while.
542.877
543.044
The only reason they even mentioned it
is because my name is on it.

# BERNADETTE
669.962
Thanks.
671.109
# HOWARD
671.109
Oh, man.
672.256
672.423
This is the boutonniere
from my high school prom. Heh-heh.
677.344
677.100
**LOL**
677.511
A piece of cake from my Bar Mitzvah.
680.681
681.100
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
681.557
Did she throw anything away?
682.745
# HOWARD
682.745
No.
683.934
684.101
If I find my foreskin,
I'm gonna kill myself.
687.062
687.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
689.106
Okay, so we've got, um, three briskets...
693.360
693.527
...four meat loafs, one lasagna
695.237
# HOWARD
695.404
No, that's noodle kugel.
697.072
# RAJ
697.239
One Jewish lasagna...
698.991
699.800
**LOL**
700.492
...two pound cakes
that are about 8 pounds each...
703.412
703.800
**LOL**
703.579
...and one giant container
of matzo ball soup.
707.166
# HOWARD
707.333
Ma always kept it on
hand in case I got sick.
712.630
713.589
She thought she could cure anything
with her cooking.
718.469
718.636
Even the time I got food poisoning.
722.056
723.432
From her cooking.
725.142
725.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
728.187
You Okay?
729.897
# HOWARD
730.564
Yeah, I'm okay.
731.941
732.650
Let's get started.
733.880
# RAJ
733.880
You got it.
735.110
# HOWARD
740.032
I'm never gonna talk to her again.
742.993
# BERNADETTE
751.460
Should we tell everyone not to come?
753.254
# HOWARD
753.420
No, I wanna do this.
756.340
# BERNADETTE
756.882
Okay. Well, I'll keep
it together if you can.
759.301
# HOWARD
760.427
Okay. Heh.
761.512
# RAJ
762.680
I'm not making any promises.
764.848
764.900
**LOL**
# STUART
768.727
Glad you guys could make it.
769.749
# LEONARD
769.749
Of course.
770.771
# PENNY
770.938
Looks really pretty in here.
772.356
# STUART
772.523
Yeah. Turns out half a dozen menorahs
really sets a mood.
775.651
776.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
778.070
Have you thought about what you'd do
if Howard sells the house?
780.990
# STUART
781.156
And there goes the mood.
783.158
782.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
783.867
Hi. Hello.
785.286
785.703
Oh, and a special hello to Leonard,
who needs to be mentioned by name.
789.957
790.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
791.583
Subtle.
792.709
# SHELDON
792.709
Yeah, but you got it, right?
793.836
794.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
796.130
Hey, guys.
797.235
# ALL
797.235
Hi.
798.340
# HOWARD
798.507
I just want everyone to know, uh,
tonight's not a sad occasion.
802.678
# BERNADETTE
802.845
We just wanna have the kind of dinner
we've all had here so many times before.
806.056
# HOWARD
806.223
Good food, good friends,
and sometime around midnight...
809.059
809.226
...heartburn that makes you pray for death.
811.562
812.100
**LOL**
# AMY
813.355
Need any help in the kitchen?
814.418
# BERNADETTE
814.418
No, we got it.
815.482
815.649
Make yourselves comfortable.
817.192
# PENNY
818.736
All right, hey, you two,
we're here for Howard right now, okay?
821.947
# AMY
822.114
Yes, so please behave yourselves.
823.178
# LEONARD
823.178
Fine.
824.241
# SHELDON
824.408
Of course.
825.701
# STUART
829.621
So I heard you two wrote a paper together.
How's that going?
832.624
833.200
**LOL**
836.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
836.920
This food is amazing.
838.756
# RAJ
838.922
And not a vegetable in sight.
841.258
# HOWARD
841.425
That's not true.
We've got tomatoes right here.
843.927
845.000
**LOL**
# AMY
846.722
All these bright people
sitting around a table by candlelight...
849.975
850.142
...feels like we could be
in an 18th-century French salon.
853.187
# SHELDON
853.354
Indeed.
854.605
855.314
Penny, a salon is a gathering where
intellectuals entertained each other...
859.735
859.902
...with sparkling conversations...
861.528
860.800
**LOL**
861.695
...about issues of the day.
863.051
# PENNY
863.051
Oh, so it's like The View.
864.406
865.500
**LOL**
# AMY
867.284
Sheldon, The View is a daytime talk show
hosted by women.
871.246
871.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
872.289
Oh, I'm aware.
It features Whoopi Goldberg.
874.958
875.125
She played Guinan on Star
876.272
876.272
Next Gen.
877.419
878.100
**LOL**
878.504
Penny, Next Gen refers to Star Trek--
880.005
# PENNY
880.005
Shut up.
881.507
881.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
883.884
I would like to propose a salon topic.
886.678
# AMY
886.845
Ooh, please do, Rajesh.
888.305
# RAJ
888.472
The lead in The Hunger Games is a woman.
890.391
890.557
Marvel has made Thor a female.
892.476
# PENNY
892.851
Wait, who's "Tor"?
894.520
# RAJ
894.978
You know, Thor, the god of thunder.
898.440
898.200
**LOL**
900.150
As I was saying, is this a sign
that our society...
903.320
903.487
...is approaching gender equality?
905.614
# HOWARD
906.490
Certainly a lot more women
are reading comic books now.
909.034
# STUART
909.201
It's true. At the store,
I had to put a seat on the toilet.
913.205
913.500
**LOL**
# AMY
914.456
We won't know if there's equality
until female Thor has a baby...
917.501
917.668
...and the Avengers are cool
with her pumping breast milk at work.
920.754
920.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
922.047
I wonder if only a baby who is worthy
can suckle at the bosom of Thor. Heh.
925.801
926.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
926.927
Okay, new salon topic.
928.262
928.429
dumb thing from a long time ago...
930.597
930.764
...or interesting thing made dumb
by talking about superheroes? Discuss.
934.852
935.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
936.895
I don't believe it matters
what the topic is.
939.022
939.189
What's crucial for a salon
is that we conduct the discussion...
942.401
942.568
...in an elevated and insightful way.
944.903
945.070
It's all about the execution.
946.864
# LEONARD
947.197
Of course you'd focus on that,
rather than the inspiration.
950.492
950.659
Uh, new salon
952.870
952.870
What's more important,
an idea or its execution?
955.080
# BERNADETTE
955.581
Oh, that's fun.
956.665
# SHELDON
956.832
Yeah, good for you, Leonard.
That's a lovely little notion.
959.835
960.002
Kind of like, "I wish I could talk
to my uncle in Chicago."
963.672
963.839
Yeah, now stand back
while I invent the telephone.
966.800
966.967
Hello? Oh, hold on.
968.635
968.802
Leonard, it's your uncle.
He says you just got burned.
972.139
972.400
**LOL**
# AMY
973.640
Sheldon.
974.620
# PENNY
974.620
No, it's okay.
975.601
# LEONARD
975.767
We're all adults trying to have
an intelligent discussion.
978.645
978.812
At least I am. Howard, what do you think?
980.898
# HOWARD
981.190
Well, I guess, as an engineer,
I lean towards execution.
985.527
985.903
I spend my days trying to take ideas
and make them real.
989.573
# SHELDON
989.990
Well said, old chap.
991.742
991.909
I thought eloquence had died,
here it stands before us.
994.620
994.786
Starting today, it will go: Gettysburg Address,
"I have a dream," and what you just said.
999.333
998.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
999.500
Oh, now he's a genius? All you ever do
is make fun of him and engineering.
1003.212
# SHELDON
1003.378
Leonard, please. His mother just died.
1006.215
1006.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1007.132
You're being ridiculous.
1008.237
# SHELDON
1008.237
Yeah, so are you.
1009.343
# PENNY
1009.510
Guys, if I wanted to hear people be bitchy,
I'd go to my real salon.
1012.846
1012.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1013.013
Lots of people could've had that idea.
1014.890
1015.057
But very few people could've worked out
the math the way I did.
1018.143
# LEONARD
1018.310
Lots of people also didn't have that idea.
1020.437
1020.604
Like everyone in the entire
world except for me.
1022.043
1021.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1022.043
Oh.
1023.482
1023.649
Well, apparently Leonard thinks he's better
than everyone in the whole world.
1027.236
1027.569
Including those fighting for our freedom.
1029.613
1029.780
Well, I don't know about you,
but I support our boys overseas.
1032.741
1033.600
**LOL**
# AMY
1035.118
And girls.
1036.349
# SHELDON
1036.349
You already ruined Thor. Give it a rest.
1037.579
1038.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1040.082
So I'm just supposed to be okay
with you hogging all the credit?
1043.377
# SHELDON
1043.544
I didn't hog anything...
1045.170
1045.337
...unlike you and that weird lasagna
with raisins in it.
1048.590
1048.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1049.007
You want some of this? I'll give you some.
1051.009
# BERNADETTE
1051.009
Sheldon, Leonard, living room right now!
1053.011
# SHELDON
1059.226
She said my name first. That must kill you.
1062.145
1062.200
**LOL**
1063.647
I don't know what you're doing, but
this is a very difficult time for my husband!
1067.526
1067.693
We're eating the last food
his mother ever made...
1069.987
1070.153
...and you were gonna throw it
at each other like children?
1072.864
1073.031
Whatever it is you're fighting about,
put it aside...
1075.284
1075.450
...go back in there, be a good friend to Howard
or there's no dessert for either of you!
1079.830
1081.400
**LOL**
1083.584
Look at me when I'm talking to you,
and don't think...
1085.919
# HOWARD
1086.086
You guys ever notice sometimes
Bernadette sounds like my mom?
1090.299

I don't think I've eaten that much
in my entire life.

# HOWARD
1109.067
It's why my people wandered the desert
for 40 years.
1112.154
1112.321
It took that long to walk it off.
1114.698
1114.500

without throwing up.
