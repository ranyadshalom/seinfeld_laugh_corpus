I have a question about Batman.
6.095
6.846
Batman is a man who dresses up like a bat.
9.682
9.849
Yeah.
10.850
11.017
Man-Bat is a part-man, part-bat hybrid.
15.396
15.772
Now, if Man-Bat dressed up as a man
to fight crime,
19.859
20.068
would he be Man-Batman?
22.278
23.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
24.030
No, he'd be Bat-Man-Bat.
26.032
26.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
27.534
But wouldn't Man-Batman just be a Batman
that was bitten by a radioactive man?
32.247
# HOWARD
32.413
But Batman is a man.
34.165
34.374
You're talking about a man
who would have the powers of a man.
37.293
37.460
That's just Man-Man.
39.254
39.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
40.630
Isn't Man-Man just Man?
42.465
# LEONARD
42.674
But what if Man-Man dressed as a bat?
44.217
# RAJ
44.384
Well, that's just Batman.
45.385
# LEONARD
45.552
No, if a man dresses as a bat,
that's Batman,
47.971
48.137
but if Man-Man dresses as a bat,
that's Bat-Man-Man.
50.640
51.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
53.393
So, does that answer your question?
54.793
# SHELDON
55.228
Oh, I haven't asked it yet.
57.063
57.200
**LOL**
58.147
Oh, that's Claire, gotta run.
59.857
# LEONARD
60.149
Thought you were back with Emily?
61.469
# RAJ
61.734
Uh, actually, I'm seeing both of them.
64.320
# LEONARD
64.821
You mean like through their window
from behind a bush?
67.824
68.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
69.492
No, I'm actually dating two women.
72.328
73.621
Later.
74.622
# LEONARD
75.081
Really?
76.541
76.833
The guy who for years
couldn't even talk to women
78.960
79.127
is suddenly going out with two of them?
80.837
81.004
How is that possible?
81.804
# HOWARD
81.804
HOWARD: I know.
82.604
82.755
Scientists have tried to reproduce it
with computational models,
85.258
85.341
but in each case, the world blows up.
88.177
88.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
94.100
Seriously, that guy's dating two women?
95.935
96.400
**LOL**
123.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
126.299
What? Why did you get a party sub?
128.009
# LEONARD
128.593
People are coming over. It looked fun.
130.113
# SHELDON
130.428
Oh, we're only watching Game of Thrones.
132.028
132.180
No, a party sub implies it's a party.
134.515
# LEONARD
135.224
Your attendance implies it's not.
137.602
138.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
139.145
I like a party as much as the next man.
140.772
140.938
As long as the next man
doesn't like a party.
142.815
143.600
**LOL**
144.609
Oh, by the way, don't forget, tomorrow is
our quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.
147.889
# LEONARD
148.154
Sheldon, we don't need a meeting
every three months.
150.531
# SHELDON
150.740
Well, it sounds like the kind of thing
one would bring up
152.450
152.533
at a quarterly Roommate Agreement meeting.
154.213
155.078
Lucky for you it's tomorrow.
157.246
157.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
158.081
Well, you know what? I'm not going.
159.916
# SHELDON
160.750
Well, you have to go.
161.793
161.959
It's Penny's first time leading
the Pledge of Allegiance.
164.545
165.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
166.589
This meeting is a waste of time.
168.174
168.341
Whether we make the switch from
Post Raisin Bran to Kellogg's Raisin Bran
171.344
171.511
should not require
parliamentary procedure.
173.721
174.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
174.931
You realize one of them
has sugar on the raisins.
177.225
177.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
178.768
You're the only one who eats them!
180.645
181.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
181.312
And yet you get to weigh in!
182.522
182.689
Democracy! It's pretty cool, isn't it?
184.399
185.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
185.733
I'm not going. You can't make me.
187.276
# SHELDON
187.443
Well, we'll just see about that.
189.237
# PENNY
189.404
What is the problem?
190.446
# SHELDON
190.613
He says he's not coming to
the Roommate Agreement meeting tomorrow.
192.907
# PENNY
192.990
What?
Why the hell did I memorize the Pledge?
195.535
195.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
197.829
You have fun. I will not be attending.
199.349
# SHELDON
199.497
Well, fine we don't have to have
a Roommate Agreement meeting
201.416
201.499
if you don't want to.
202.188
# LEONARD
202.188
Thank you.
202.876
# SHELDON
202.959
Of course, this will require a vote.
204.399
204.585
Unfortunately, my official gavel
is in my bedroom.
207.296
207.463
But luckily, I have my travel gavel.
209.966
210.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
213.094
You're being ridiculous.
214.470
# SHELDON
214.679
There's a motion on the floor,
"I'm ridiculous."
216.181
216.264
Do we have a second?
217.390
217.682
Mmm? Mmm?
There is no second. The motion is denied.
219.726
219.892
Next time, make sure
you have the votes first.
221.353
221.436
That was embarrassing.
222.996
222.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
225.064
Can you please talk to him?
226.149
# PENNY
226.315
Oh, why are you fighting him on this?
227.525
# LEONARD
227.608
Because I am tired of him
always getting his way.
230.153
230.319
We don't need a stupid meeting,
we don't even need a Roommate Agreement,
232.864
232.947
and I hope that sandwich
does cause a party!
235.074
235.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
236.993
Well, I will still come to your meeting.
238.661
# SHELDON
238.828
You... Well, I should hope so.
Tomorrow's picture day.
240.955
241.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
243.332
Why are you taking his side?
244.667
# PENNY
244.834
Because it's important to him.
245.919
246.002
And when we signed the Roommate Agreement,
we made a deal.
247.879
# SHELDON
247.962
Yeah, you keep talking like that,
you're gonna make color guard.
250.590
251.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
254.927
Man, I'm worn out.
256.262
# HOWARD
256.345
I know.
257.346
257.513
Imagine if we were actually moving.
259.265
259.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
261.225
No, it's just, ever since I started dating
Claire and Emily at the same time,
265.521
265.688
it's exhausting.
267.398
268.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
268.483
You're exhausted?
269.525
269.692
Try folding every five pages
in a pregnancy book,
271.694
271.861
so your wife thinks you read it.
273.529
274.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
275.364
But, dude, you're so lucky.
276.824
276.991
Getting to stay at home at night
with the woman you love.
279.619
# HOWARD
280.369
I guess I am lucky.
281.370
# RAJ
281.370
You are.
282.371
282.538
Because dating two women...
285.166
286.292
I mean, I can't even remember
the last time I slept in my own apartment
290.379
287.000
**LOL**
291.100
**LOL**
291.005
I wake up and I'm like, "Am I at Claire's?
Am I at Emily's?
294.050
294.217
"Is there a third girl
I've forgotten about?
296.636
297.600
**LOL**
298.304
Like, "Where am I?"

# BERNADETTE
304.101
Good. A little tired.
305.228

305.394
I feel you.
I've been dating multiple women.
308.272

309.899
You sure you don't wanna come watch
Game of Thrones with us?
311.943
# BERNADETTE
312.026
You guys have fun.
313.027
313.194
I'm just gonna snuggle up in bed
with a book.
314.954
# RAJ
315.154
Oh, that sounds great. A bed to yourself.
318.074
318.241
Can't even remember what that's like.
320.535
320.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
324.247
Are you up-to-date on Game of Thrones?
326.290

326.457
Mmm. I think so.
327.583
327.750
Dragons, snow zombies,
and all the hot guys are dead.
331.128
332.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
333.381
Oh, I don't know.
334.423
334.590
Theon Greyjoy looks pretty good for a guy
who has genitals cut off.
337.677

341.389
Uh-oh, somebody's still pouting.
343.474
# LEONARD
343.641

344.642
# PENNY
344.809
If it's because you lost a stick,
I know where it went.
347.270
348.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
350.231
Not funny.
351.232
# PENNY
351.440
You know you're gonna make up with him.
Can we just skip to that part?
353.777
# LEONARD
353.860
Oh, of course,
because I'm the only adult around here.
356.028
# PENNY
356.195
Really? "The only adult"?
357.613
# LEONARD
357.780
Yeah, that's right.
359.323
# SHELDON
359.532
Tonight, I'll be watching a show
rated M.A.,
361.252
361.409
and that stands for
"mature audiences," buster.
363.953
364.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
365.788
Yeah, you would think the "only adult"
367.123
367.206
wouldn't let something silly
ruin our entire night.
369.375
# LEONARD
369.584
And I'd think you'd understand
why I'm annoyed.
371.794
# SHELDON
371.961
You... All of this could be avoided
if you'd just come to the meeting.
374.547
# LEONARD
374.630
I don't want to.
375.798
# SHELDON
375.965
Oh, it's just a meeting.
One simple meeting.
378.092

378.301
Stop saying "meeting"!

I brought my famous spinach dip.

No, Amy, just one second.
385.975
390.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
391.230
I'm not sure if I'm hoping
for a boy or a girl.
393.983
394.150
I mean, If it's a boy, I'm gonna have
to teach him to play catch,
397.987
395.900
**LOL**
398.195
which means I'm gonna have to google
how to play catch.
400.355
401.100
**LOL**
402.825
And if it's a girl...
404.535
404.994
I mean, they're so innocent,
and you know how guys are.
408.581
# RAJ
408.831
Totally. Guys are the worst.
410.499
410.917
Look at me.
412.460
412.900
**LOL**
413.753
I let Emily make me a frittata,
416.631
416.797
and I kept the leftovers
in Claire's fridge that night.
419.842
420.009
I'm such a dog.
421.552
422.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
425.181
There you go again.
426.474
# RAJ
426.766
I'm sorry.
Have I been complaining about it too much?
428.768
# HOWARD
428.851
No, actually what you're doing
is pretending to complain,
431.646
430.200
**LOL**
431.812
but really trying to brag.
433.189
# RAJ
433.356
How could you say that?
434.565
# HOWARD
435.107
"Oh, I wish I could enjoy a cup of tea
436.943
436.400
**LOL**
437.026
"without a naked girl
bouncing up and down on me."
440.446
441.100

442.156
I never said that.
443.574
# HOWARD
443.741
"Don't you hate it when you can't remember
445.421
445.534
"whose bra it is
you found wedged in your couch?"
448.829
449.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
451.123
Okay, that I said.
452.166
453.584
But that's a real problem!
455.211
455.378
You give a girl another woman's bra,
457.046
457.213
and you will not
be having sex with her that night.
459.298
459.632
Maybe the other girl, but not her.
461.634
464.600
**LOL**
# AMY
469.016
What's going on with him?
470.393
# PENNY
470.810
Oh, he's all bent out of shape about
having a Roommate Agreement meeting.
473.690
# SHELDON
474.230
Apparently, perfect attendance
isn't cool anymore.
476.941
477.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
478.484
Don't worry, he'll come around.
479.902
# AMY
480.319
Oh, I get why he's annoyed.
481.737
# SHELDON
482.238
Oh, then you don't understand
what's happening.
484.198
485.300
**LOL**
485.366
See, Leonard refused to participate
486.766
486.867
in a mandatory quarterly
Roommate Agreement meeting.
489.328
489.745
This is what a generation raised
on Bart Simpson looks like.

# LEONARD
494.083
You love The Simpsons.

# AMY
500.715
Well, I know how he feels.
502.174
502.341
I never enjoyed
our Relationship Agreement meetings.
504.802
# SHELDON
505.469
Wait. You were pretending?
507.596
# AMY
508.931
Sorry.
509.974
# SHELDON
510.141
No.

542.339
# HOWARD
542.506
No, I'm fine.
543.716
# RAJ
543.883
Really?
Because usually we walk side by side,
545.843
546.010
and I just went up two flights of stairs
staring at your bottom.
549.138
549.800
**LOL**

551.348
Just drop it.
552.641
# RAJ
552.850
Okay, I think I see what's happening here.

555.144
You're jealous of me.
555.978
# HOWARD
555.978
Oh...
556.812
556.979
Please. What could you possibly have
that I would be jealous of?
559.857
# RAJ
560.107
It's not what I have,
it's how many people I'm having it with.
563.152

# PENNY
565.821
Come on, Sheldon.
We'll watch Game of Thrones over here.
568.032
# SHELDON
568.240
Gladly.
569.053
# LEONARD
569.053
Good, go.
569.867
570.034
You know, it'll be nice to watch
an episode without someone saying,
572.412
572.495
"I read the books,
don't get too fond of this character."
575.498
576.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
576.457
It's not always because they die.
578.000
578.167
In one case,
it's because they've become involved
580.003
580.086
with underground tree people
from the dawn of time.
582.171
582.338
Yeah, but I won't say who it is.
583.618
583.756
It's Bran.

587.009
What is going on?

Fine.
I don't want to watch with you, either.

Okay, then you go there!

Don't tell me where to go!

Howard, just come in here.
602.149
# PENNY
602.316
Yeah, come on, Raj.
603.859
# RAJ
604.360
Wait, did Amy make a spinach dip?
605.528
# SHELDON
605.528
She did.
606.695
# HOWARD
606.862
And I'm gonna eat it all!

# HOWARD
617.373
So what the hell happened?
618.413
# LEONARD
618.541
Oh, I just ran out of patience
with Sheldon's nonsense.
621.293
# HOWARD
621.544
Tell me about it.
I've had it with Raj, too.
623.629
# AMY
623.879
You know, like women,
men have a monthly hormone cycle.
626.632
626.799
Dips in testosterone
can cause irritability.
628.926
# HOWARD
629.301
Interesting.
630.302
630.511
Well, maybe my male cycle
synced up with Raj's actual period.
634.306
635.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
636.767
If Sheldon's testosterone dipped,
he'd become a butterfly.
639.854
640.200
**LOL**
641.564
Oh...
642.565
643.399
Maybe someone's here to apologize.

# STUART
652.491
Uh...
653.492
655.786
This not a dress up party?
657.413
658.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
658.956
No.
659.999
# STUART
662.710
Was it ever a dress up party?

**LOL**
# LEONARD
666.463
No.
667.506
# STUART
668.591
Howard, didn't you tell me
it was a dress up party?

Yep.

Thanks.

This thing kept getting caught
in the chain of my bike.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
698.454
Well, I'll catch you up.
699.997
700.247
Uh, Penny is angry at Leonard.
Leonard's angry at me and Penny.
702.917
703.083
I'm angry at Leonard and Amy.
704.627
704.793
Raj is angry at Howard.
706.295
706.462
And I'm angry at George R.R. Martin
708.672
708.839
'cause there are no new books for me
to spoil it for Leonard.
711.239
711.700
**LOL**
# STUART
712.927
So, what happened with you and Howard?
714.970
# RAJ
715.429
He says I was talking too much
about dating Claire and Emily,
718.015
718.182
and I accused him of being jealous.
720.142
# STUART
720.351
I'm jealous.
721.477
721.769
Closest I've come to dating two women
was that time I dated one woman.

# LEONARD
730.319
I don't know how you put up with it.
731.904
732.154
He's impossible.
733.280
733.447
I mean, holding a meeting to decide
what breakfast cereal we should buy.
736.867
# HOWARD
737.117
Yeah. Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries.
Move on.
740.204
740.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
742.289
Anyway, Amy,
thank you for sticking up for me.
744.667
# AMY
745.167
Oh, I honestly couldn't care less.
747.294
747.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
748.629
Sorry?
749.630
# AMY
749.880
Well, I just took your side
'cause sometimes I get annoyed
751.716
751.799
at how close Sheldon and Penny are.
753.676
# LEONARD
755.010
They argue all the time.
They aren't that close.
757.763
# AMY
758.055
Who's always comforting him
when he's upset?
760.015
# LEONARD
760.683
Penny, but
761.684
# AMY
761.850
Who's the only one who can make him
take his medicine when he's sick?
764.270
# LEONARD
764.353
I try to hide it in his peanut butter,
but he spits it out.
767.231
767.700
**LOL**
# AMY
770.067
Okay, and did you know she has him
add things to the Roommate Agreement,
773.529
773.696
so she can get her way,
and not fight with you about it?
776.615
# LEONARD
777.283
Son of a bitch.
778.826
779.000
**LOL**
784.873
Why is that funny?
785.916
# HOWARD
786.125
I don't know. I like the pain of others.
788.168
788.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
790.337
Oh, well, then, you'll enjoy this.
792.381
792.548
Bernadette does the same thing
with you and Koothrappali.
795.217
# HOWARD
795.384
No, she doesn't.
796.385
# LEONARD
796.552
She defends him all the time.
798.053
# HOWARD
798.262
She does not.
799.555
# AMY
799.722
Who told you to stop making
all those Gandhi jokes about him?
802.683
803.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
804.393
Well, she did, and Human Resources.
807.229
808.600
**LOL**

Who do you think told Koothrappali
to go to Human Resources?

You're right. It feels good.

All right, it's almost game time.

840.929
# PENNY
842.598
What's up?
843.599
# LEONARD
843.807
You know, you don't need to use Sheldon
845.184
845.267
to get your way with me
in a dumb Roommate Agreement.
847.353
# PENNY
847.519
Where did you get that from?
848.520
# LEONARD
848.520
From Amy.
849.521
# PENNY
849.688
On, Amy, why did you tell him that?
852.107
# AMY
852.441
Because you were defending Sheldon
like you always do.
854.610
# PENNY
854.777
I don't always defend Sheldon.
856.028
# LEONARD
856.028
Oh, yes, you do.
857.279
857.446
You know you have a weird brother-sister,
Elliott-E.T. relationship with him.
861.575
861.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
862.242
What about your
weird relationship with him?
863.911
# LEONARD
863.994
That's different.
865.037
865.245
I'm like the little girl in Poltergeist
and he's the creepy thing in the TV.
868.499
869.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
870.417
Um, guys,
were there any nuts in that food?
873.962
# LEONARD
874.129
I don't think so, why?
875.297
# HOWARD
875.464
Well, just a feeling.
877.883
878.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
879.843
Oh...
880.844
887.351
It just said "Italian sub."
889.103
889.269
I had no idea mortadella
has pistachios in it.
892.231
# SHELDON
893.315
Interesting fact.
894.358
894.525
In Italian, the "morta" in "mortadella",
means death.

Now it's a fun fact.

Boy, stuff like this
really puts things in perspective.
915.462

Why are you dressed like that?
917.089
# STUART
917.631
Oh, uh...
918.632
918.841
Howard thought it'd be funny
to tell me it was a costume party.
921.969
# BERNADETTE
922.136
That wasn't nice.
923.137
# STUART

No, but he almost died. So we're cool.

You know, if you think about it,
930.352

tonight was kind of like
a real-life Game of Thrones.
933.856
# AMY
934.064
How?
935.107
# RAJ
935.274
Well, Howard eating that pistachio,
was like when King Joffrey got poisoned.
939.153
# PENNY
939.361
Okay, well, that was murder.
This was an accident.
941.780
# RAJ
941.947
Okay.
942.948
943.449
But you using Sheldon
to do your dirty work,
946.785
946.952
is like when Cersei
used the Kingsguard to do her bidding.
950.038
# SHELDON
950.622
Cersei uses her body to manipulate men.
953.125
953.292
Penny just takes me to the Lego store.

**LOL**
# RAJ
957.713
Okay. Oh, how about this.
959.381

Stuart's dressed like a brother of the
Night's Watch, and they don't have sex.
963.719

I'm fine.
972.102

Just a little embarrassed I had to be
carried down the stairs like a baby.

# SHELDON
982.946
Well, the important thing is,
984.106
984.239
I said that big sandwich
would ruin everything,
986.079
986.200
and I was right.
987.576

and then fought crime
disguised as Man-Bat,
1065.821
1065.988
would he be Man-Bat-Man-Bat-Man
