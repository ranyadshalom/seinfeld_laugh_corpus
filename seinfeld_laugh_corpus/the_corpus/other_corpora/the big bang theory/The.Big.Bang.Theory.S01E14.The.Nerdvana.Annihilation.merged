In a proper sandwich,
the cheese is adjacent to the bread...

It was a spur-of-the-moment thing.

In a Venn diagram,

It's actually a tremendous bargain.

Go up to the roof, hop over
to the next building-- There's a gap.
281.657

We're going to need some ground rules.
"No shoes in the time machine."

"No eating in the time machine."

Twice a month.

530.405

You can't. If you were to prevent yourself
from buying it in the past...

643.685
...you would not have it available
to stop yourself from buying it.

What if I knocked you unconscious
right now?

672.172
It won't change the past.
674.341

But it'd make the present so much nicer.

# SHELDON
679.388
Are you upset about something?
681.723
# LEONARD
681.890
What was your first clue?
683.850
683.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
684.518
Well, it was a number of things.
First, the late hour.
687.396
687.562
Then your demeanor
seems very low-energy.
689.439
689.606
Plus your irritability--
690.524
# LEONARD
690.524
Yes, I'm upset.
691.441
# SHELDON
691.608
Oh.
692.651
692.818
I don't usually pick up on those things.
695.612
695.779
Good for me.
697.406
697.300

# LEONARD
700.033
Yeah, good for you.
701.034
# SHELDON
702.119
Oh, wait.
703.287
705.080
Did you wanna talk about
what's bothering you?
707.499
# LEONARD
708.750
I don't know. Maybe.
710.148
# SHELDON
710.148
Wow, I'm on fire tonight.
711.545
712.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
716.967
Well, here's the thing.
718.635
718.802
Girls like Penny never end up with guys
who own time machines.
722.889
# SHELDON
723.307
I disagree.
724.474
724.641
Your inability
to successfully woo Penny...
726.935
727.102
...long predates your acquisition
of the time machine.
730.314
729.800
**LOL**
732.024
That failure clearly stands on its own.
735.068
# LEONARD
736.111
Thanks for pointing it out.
737.654
# SHELDON
737.654
In addition, your premise is flawed.
739.197
739.364
In the original film,
Rod Taylor got Yvette Mimieux...
742.242
742.409
...with that time machine.
743.827
743.994
In Back to the Future,
Marty McFly got to hook up...
746.705
746.872
...with his extremely attractive
young mother.
749.666
749.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
752.210
Those are movies.
753.503
# SHELDON
753.503
Of course they're movies.
754.796
754.963
Are you expecting an example
involving a real-life time machine?
759.468
758.900
**LOL**
761.303
That's absurd.
763.263
762.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
764.765
Come on, guys, push.
766.099

If I push any harder,
I'm gonna give birth to my colon.

Yeah, okay, neat.
But I really gotta get to work.

# PENNY
797.798

What are you doing?
845.846
# LEONARD
846.596
I'm packing up all my collectibles...
848.076
848.223
...and taking them down
to the comic-book store to sell.
850.684
# SHELDON
851.309
Is that really necessary?
853.019
853.186
If you need money,
you can always sell blood.
856.273
857.399
And semen.
859.401
858.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
860.068
It's not about money.
861.278
862.237
We brought food.

Lox and bagels,
the breakfast of time travelers.

# LEONARD
866.908
Terrific. Anyone wanna buy
my share of the time machine?
869.578
# RAJ
869.744
Why?
870.725
# LEONARD
870.725
Because I don't want it anymore.
871.705
# HOWARD
871.872
Why?
873.082
# LEONARD
873.082
Just personal reasons.
874.291
# SHELDON
874.458
My Spidey sense tells me
this has something to do with Penny.
877.502
877.600

# LEONARD
878.044
Look, do you wanna buy me out or not?
880.213
# RAJ
880.380
I'll give you $100, which will make me
half-owner, and we'll put it on my balcony.
884.217
# HOWARD
884.384
Screw his balcony.
I'll give you 120 and put it in my garage.
887.220
# LEONARD
887.387
I paid $200 for my share.
889.118
# RAJ
889.118
Everybody knows a time machine loses...
890.849
891.016
...half its value the minute
you drive it off the lot.
894.102
893.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
894.478
I'll go for 200.
That time machine stays right where it is.
897.189
# RAJ
897.355
Three hundred. And I'll throw in my
original 1979 Mattel Millennium Falcon...
900.942
901.109
...with real light-speed sound effects.
902.986
903.200

# LEONARD
903.153
No. No more toys or action figures
or props or replicas...
907.866
908.033
...or costumes or robots
or Darth Vader voice changers.
911.411
911.578
I'm getting rid of all of it.
913.497
# HOWARD
913.663
You can't do that.
Look what you've created.

It's like Nerdvana.

I called dibs.
932.620
# HOWARD
932.620
You can't.
933.266
# RAJ
933.433
I can and I did.
Look up "dibs" in Wikipedia.
936.311
936.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
937.312
Dibs doesn't apply in a bidding war.
939.022
# LEONARD
939.189
It's not a bidding war. I'm selling it all
to Larry down at the comic-book store.
942.943
# RAJ
943.109
Why Larry? Did Larry call dibs?
944.590
# HOWARD
944.590
Will you forget dibs?
946.071

# LEONARD
946.238
He offered me a fair price
for the whole collection.

What's the number? I'll match it.
950.930
# RAJ

I'll match it, plus 1000 rupees.

None of your business. Take it or leave it.

and two trees in Israel.
