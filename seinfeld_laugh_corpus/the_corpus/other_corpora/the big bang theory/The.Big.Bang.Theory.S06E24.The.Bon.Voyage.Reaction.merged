So anyway, last night
on video chat, I spent,
5.875
5.959
like, 20 minutes just
staring into Lucy's eyes.
8.514
# LEONARD
8.640
That sounds romantic.
9.634
# RAJ
9.718
It was, until I realized
the screen had frozen.
12.226
12.700
**LOL**
13.895
Still one of my top three
dates of all time.
16.231
16.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
16.606
So we ever gonna hang out with this girl?
18.525
# RAJ
18.733
Ahh, I'd love that, but she's not
really comfortable around people.
21.945
# SHELDON
22.153
Yeah, I used to be uncomfortable
around people, but then I learned a trick.
26.783
25.300
**LOL**
26.991
I pretend everyone I meet
is a beloved character from Star Trek.
31.246
32.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
32.580
How's that working for you?
33.873
# SHELDON
34.082
Oh, like a charm,
unnamed crewman in a red shirt.
37.418
37.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
38.753
Leonard, I may have gotten you a job.
41.631
# LEONARD
42.215
I have a job.
44.342
# SHELDON
44.342
Yes, he does. He caters to my every whim.
46.469
46.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
47.095
No, in a couple of weeks, Stephen Hawking's
team is sending an expedition...
51.224
51.432
...to the North Sea to test
hydrodynamic simulations of black holes.
54.561
54.769
One of their experimental physicists
dropped out and I recommended you.
58.815
# LEONARD
59.607
Well, do you really think I have a shot?
61.484
# HOWARD
61.693
Yeah, I've worked with Hawking,
I talked you up. He knows your research.
65.238
65.446
I think this could happen.
66.405
# LEONARD
66.405
He kno--?
67.365
67.574
Wow.
68.616
# SHELDON
68.825
Wait, now, but do you think
that's a good idea?
72.120
72.400
**LOL**
73.454
You know Star Trek.
74.581
74.789
Should a guy with no name
and a red shirt really go on an expedition?
79.043
80.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
80.670
Hey, don't discourage him.
This is a fantastic opportunity.
83.506
# SHELDON
83.715
No one asked you, Uhura.
85.800
88.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
89.637
Would you like to hear a classic
Sheldon Cooper factoid?
93.474
# LEONARD
93.683
What do you think?
94.538
# SHELDON
94.538
Great.
95.393
96.300
**LOL**
96.936
I've been doing some reading
about vehicular safety.
100.273
100.481
Did you know that the highest number
of drowning accidents...
104.444
104.100
**LOL**
104.652
...happen on or around boats?
108.197
107.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
108.656
Interesting that you would bring that up
when I might go work on a boat.
112.493
112.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
112.702
Well, that's the thing about factoids,
they're interesting.
115.663
116.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
117.707
I know what you're doing.
119.709
120.126
You don't want me going on this trip
because you're afraid to be alone.
123.546
# SHELDON
124.005
I'm not afraid to be alone.
125.923
126.132
On land.
127.216
127.700
**LOL**
129.260
On the sea, it would be terrifying.
131.179
131.600
**LOL**
133.514
Because of all the drowning.
135.683
135.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
137.310
Sheldon.
138.478
# SHELDON
138.478
Fine, no more drowning talk.
139.646
139.854
I'll change the subject.
141.689
142.600
**LOL**
142.440
Who do you think would win in a fight...
145.276
145.485
...you or a shark?
148.488
148.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
149.781
Look, I appreciate your signature blend of
concern for me and incredible selfishness...
154.786
155.700
**LOL**
156.037
...but if I get the chance to do this, there's
nothing you can say that's going to stop me.
160.625
# SHELDON
160.833
Very well.
162.251
164.200
**LOL**
164.045
Things between you and Penny
have never been better.
166.422
166.631
I hope four months apart
doesn't change anything.
169.258
171.300
**LOL**
174.764
I should've opened with that, huh?
176.808
203.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
204.001
If you look carefully at Venus...
205.920
206.129
...you should be able to see
the International Space Station pass by.
210.216
# LUCY
210.425
Wow, your friend was actually up there?
213.386
# RAJ
213.594
Yeah, he brought me back
a T-shirt that
216.013
215.100
**LOL**
216.222
"My Friend Went to the Space Station
and All I Got Was This Lousy T-shirt."
220.435
220.400
**LOL**
# LUCY
221.477
Did he take the T-shirt to space?
223.104
# RAJ
223.312
Nope. It's exactly as lousy as advertised.
225.815
225.800
**LOL**
227.608
Speaking of friends,
they have been asking to meet you.
231.028
231.946
I was thinking maybe
we could all hang out sometime?
234.949
# LUCY
235.158
I don't know, how many are there?
236.951
# RAJ
237.368
Let's see. Six.
239.454
239.662
That's pretty cool. I have six friends.
241.956
241.900
**LOL**
244.041
I'm kind of like Sinatra.
246.043
246.000
**LOL**
# LUCY
247.962
Six strangers, that's a lot of pressure.
250.757
250.965
Staring at me, asking me
personal questions like, "What do you do?
255.219
255.678
Where are you from? Why did you
lock yourself in the bathroom?"
259.974
259.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
260.349
Okay, how about you just
dip your toe in and meet one of them?
264.562
# LUCY
266.022
Will you be there?
267.252
# RAJ
267.252
Of course.
268.483
# LUCY
268.691
Well, that's two. Three if you count me.
This is getting out of hand.
271.986
275.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
274.864
So then, during my afternoon shift, I
spilled an entire tray of drinks on myself.
279.368
# LEONARD
279.577
Oh, that's awful.
280.974
# PENNY
280.974
Not really. My shirt was soaking wet.
282.371
282.580
I got, like, the biggest tip of my life.
284.832
285.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
287.502
So listen, do you remember
when I said the similarities...
290.630
290.838
...of the equations of general relativity
and hydrodynamics...
293.633
293.841
...suggest you could find the equivalent of
Unruh radiation in a large body of water?
298.221
# PENNY
299.013
I thought I said that to you.
301.015
301.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
305.561
Anyway, Stephen Hawking's team is looking into
that, and I've been invited to join them.
310.900
# PENNY
311.108
Wow, Hawking. Good for you.
313.569
# LEONARD
313.778
Well, it is,
just, you know, I'd be gone for a while.
316.823
# PENNY
317.031
Well, how long?
318.115
# LEONARD
318.115
Three, four months.
319.200
# PENNY
319.575
Whoa.
321.160
321.369
When would you leave?
322.558
# LEONARD
322.558
Couple of weeks.
323.746
# PENNY
324.831
Wow.
325.873
326.082
Okay, well, I'll just come visit you.
327.625
# LEONARD
327.625
That's the thing, you can't.
329.168
329.377
I'll be on a ship in the North Sea.
331.337
# PENNY
331.546
On a ship? Aren't they afraid
Hawking will just roll overboard?
335.341
335.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
337.802
He's not gonna be there. He's just
sending a team to research his theory.
341.764
# PENNY
341.973
Oh, sure. Like when you send me
to kill spiders in your bathtub.
346.185
346.200
**LOL**
349.272
Oh. Okay. So four months.
352.024
# LEONARD
352.233
Yeah.
353.442
353.651
And I'm a little worried because
things between us have been so great...
357.530
357.738
...and I'd hate to do anything
that screws that up.
360.533
# PENNY
360.741
If you're gonna screw things up...
362.368
362.577
...it's gonna be while you're here,
not while you're away.
365.413
368.700
**LOL**
370.459
I mean, look, you have to go.
It sounds like an amazing opportunity.
373.921
374.130
And I'm just basing that on how much
I didn't understand what you said about it.
377.842
378.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
379.594
Okay. I'll confirm the travel arrangements
in the morning.
383.264
# PENNY
383.806
Okay, good.
384.974
# LEONARD
386.058
I do have to ask you one favor.
387.163
# PENNY
387.163
Sure.
388.269
# LEONARD
388.477
Sheldon's nervous about me leaving,
keep an eye on him while I'm gone.
391.731
# PENNY
391.939
Oh, I don't know. Remember what happened
when I took care of your goldfish?
396.277
396.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
397.612
Well, flush Sheldon down the toilet
and get me a new one.
400.489
403.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
403.618
Really, you guys do not need
to throw me a going away party.
406.329
# HOWARD
406.537
Are you kidding me?
How often can you say Bon voyage...
409.415
409.624
...to somebody when they're
actually going on a voyage?

Hello, Amy. Nice to see you.

425.139
What can I say,
it's funnier with the accent.
427.850
427.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
428.643
There's beer in the fridge. Anyway, you
guys really don't need to make a big deal.
432.438
# SHELDON
432.647
Leonard, you're being selfish.
434.023
434.231
We need to give you a proper send-off
so we'll have closure...
437.276
437.485
...when you die at sea
and crabs eat your face.
439.987
440.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
441.322
Sheldon, sweetie, shut up.
443.407
# BERNADETTE
444.575
One of the things that helped me get through
Howard being in space for so long...
448.287
448.496
...was getting married before he left.
450.456
450.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
453.501
Bernadette, sweetie, shut up.
455.878
455.700

# RAJ
457.254
Okay, I have a request to make.
459.674
# AMY
459.882
And now he can talk.
462.468
462.400
**LOL**
462.885
I want to cut open your brain
and see what the heck's going on in there.
466.514
466.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
467.723
The only person allowed
inside this head is Dr. Phil.
471.102
471.000
**LOL**
472.436
Anyway, I spoke to my new lady friend
about meeting you all.
475.314
475.523
She thought it would be easier
for her to start with just one.
478.317
# SHELDON
478.526
Gee, I don't know,
my schedule is a little busy.
482.363
482.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
482.905
Actually, I was thinking Leonard.
484.699
# LEONARD
485.116
Well, thank you, Raj, I'd be honored.
487.535
# HOWARD
487.743
What the hell?
I thought I was your best friend.
491.163
490.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
491.372
You are, but you've got
kind of a big personality...
494.041
494.250
...with your flashy clothes
and your Woody Allen swagger.
498.421
500.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
501.382
Maybe she'd be more comfortable
meeting a girl first.
503.843
# RAJ
504.051
Good idea. Bernadette?
505.428
# PENNY
505.428
What the hell?
506.804
506.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
507.638
Well, you're very pretty, that could
be intimidating to another woman.
511.017
# PENNY
511.225
Oh, yeah.
512.727
513.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
513.394
Hey, you don't think I'm pretty enough
to scare your girlfriend?
516.939
516.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
517.148
Calm down, Bernie, you're very scary.
520.109
519.900
**LOL**
# AMY
521.819
It should be me.
522.987
# RAJ
523.487
Why? So you can make jokes
about cutting open my brain?
526.574
526.800
**LOL**
# AMY
527.616
A, that was not a joke,
that was a sincere request.
531.120
531.800
**LOL**
532.788
And B, more importantly,
I was the outsider to this group...
535.958
536.167
...and I know how frightening that can be.
538.169
538.377
But you guys took me in
and made me feel loved, like I was family.
543.174
# SHELDON
546.594
Fine, I'll do it.
547.970
548.700
**LOL**
# AMY
551.098
So after I started dating Sheldon,
I met Leonard and then everybody else...
555.603
555.811
...and they've all been so wonderful to me.
557.980
# LUCY
558.189
That's really nice to hear.
559.398
# AMY
559.607
Maybe next week we could all get together.
561.942
# RAJ
562.151
Lucy, you don't have to answer that.
564.153
564.361
Don't put her on the spot,
she hates that. Am I right?
566.947
567.156
Tell her how much you hate being
put on the spot. Go ahead, tell her.
570.493
570.000
**LOL**
# AMY
570.701
He's a little nervous...
571.786
571.994
...because he doesn't think I understand
the severity of your social anxiety.
575.498
# RAJ
575.706
You can't talk about social anxiety
to someone who has social anxiety...
579.376
577.100
**LOL**
579.585
...it makes them socially anxious.
582.046

# AMY
582.671
Excuse me, but I'm a neurobiologist,
I think I'm more qualified than you...
586.258
586.467
...to understand what's not working
in your girlfriend's brain.
589.428
589.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
590.346
Don't call her my girlfriend.
591.722
591.931
We haven't discussed whether
we're girlfriend and boyfriend yet.
594.975
595.810
Now that it's out there...
597.812
598.000
**LOL**
599.980
...are you my girlfriend? By the way,
if you say no, I'll never be happy again.
604.318
605.653
Not to put you on the spot.
607.321
607.400

I think I have to go to the bathroom.
612.368

We might as well go ahead and eat.
She's not coming back any time soon.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
625.548
This is ridiculous.
We're shopping for a party.
627.842
628.050
This store doesn't have a party section.

629.969
Yeah, it does, and here we are.
632.263
632.100

# SHELDON
634.431
I have to say, Penny, I don't
understand why you, of all people...
637.977
638.185
...are encouraging Leonard to do this.
640.020
# PENNY
640.229
Well, I'm his girlfriend,
of course I'm gonna support him.
642.982
641.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
643.190
Well, you're his girlfriend for now.
645.192
645.401
Maybe you're not aware of this, but there
is a rich tradition of men at sea...
649.822
646.500
**LOL**
650.030
...finding comfort in each other's arms
and britches.
653.409

**LOL**
# PENNY
655.744
Honey, this is a big
deal for Leonard, okay?
657.955
658.164
He gets to work with Stephen Hawking, who, by
the way, will not be on the boat, I checked.
662.918
662.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
663.669
It's not that big of an opportunity. I mean,
even if Hawking's theories are correct...
667.631
667.840
...all they prove is
where the universe came from...
670.217
670.426
...why everything exists
and what its ultimate end will be.
674.013
674.300
**LOL**
674.305
Me? I'm interested in the big questions.
677.224
678.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
679.435
Oh, my God,
Sheldon the genius is jealous of Leonard.
682.730
# SHELDON
682.938
I'm not jealous.
684.732
684.940
I'm just very unhappy that good things are
happening for him and not happening for me.
689.987
685.900
**LOL**
689.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
690.654
Sweetie, this is a natural thing to feel.
692.656
692.865
Just because good things
are happening to Leonard...
695.284
695.492
...doesn't take anything away from you.
Let me tell you a story.
698.370
698.579
There was a girl who worked
at the Cheesecake Factory...
700.581
700.664
...and she wasn't good at her job.
701.603
# SHELDON
701.603
It was you.
702.542
# PENNY
702.625
It wasn't me.
704.251
703.900
**LOL**
705.753
But she was also an actress.
707.046
707.254
We were both up for the same part
in a toothpaste commercial. She got it.
710.549
710.000
**LOL**
710.758
I was so jealous, but instead of
ripping out her fake blond hair
714.386
# SHELDON
714.595
You ripped out your own fake blond hair.
716.972
716.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
718.265
I looked her in the eye, smiled and said,
"I'm happy for you."
722.269
722.478
Because that's what friends do.
724.605
# SHELDON
725.397
They lie so they don't look petty.
727.399
727.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
727.608
Yeah.
728.755
# SHELDON
728.755
How?
729.902
# PENNY
730.110
Like this.
731.779
731.987
I am so happy for you.
734.531
735.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
737.660
Wow.
738.994
739.203
No wonder you didn't get
that toothpaste commercial.
742.122
741.700
**LOL**
746.293
Hey.
747.315
# LUCY
747.315
Hey.
748.337
# RAJ
748.837
I want to apologize for Amy last night.
She was completely out of line.
752.883
756.300
**LOL**
759.014
Are you not speaking to me
or did the screen freeze again?
762.518
762.200
**LOL**
# LUCY
763.018
Amy wasn't the problem.
764.812
# RAJ
765.521
Okay, I know, it was me.
768.107
768.315
I pushed too hard. I'm sorry.
770.359
# LUCY
770.567
Thank you.
771.860
# RAJ
773.028
You know, I've been thinking that maybe
meeting somebody one-on-one...
776.740
776.949
...is too intense...
778.117
778.325
...so Friday night,
my friends are having a party.
781.203
# LUCY
781.412
A party?
782.538
# RAJ
782.538
A little one.
783.664
783.200
**LOL**
783.872
It's a farewell for Leonard,
so all the attention will be on him.
788.168
788.377
If you wear something brown and sit on the
couch, they won't even know you're there.
792.339
792.500
**LOL**
# LUCY
794.550
I'm not sure.
795.530
# RAJ
795.530
Please.
796.510
# LUCY
796.719
Raj.
797.783
# RAJ
797.783
Come on, don't make me beg.
798.846
799.054
And I'm from India, so I know how to do it.
801.390
801.100
**LOL**
# LUCY
804.560
Okay.
805.602
# RAJ
805.811
Yeah, thank you. This means a lot to me.
808.355
808.564
My friends are like my family.
810.649
810.858
Unless you don't like them,
in which case, they're dead to me.
813.736
815.500
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
817.114
You ever spent a long time in a boat before?
818.657
# LEONARD
818.657
Yeah.
820.200
# BERNADETTE
820.409
Are you referring to the time we got stuck
on the Small World ride at Disneyland?
824.246
# LEONARD
825.998
Yeah.
827.458
827.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
830.169
I'm proud of you, Leonard.
831.378
831.587
Working out on the North Sea for months?
That's really something.
835.883
# LEONARD
836.091
I know.
837.134
837.343
As far as science goes,
this is the adventure of a lifetime.
840.179
# HOWARD
840.387
Ha, ha. Maybe your
lifetime, I went to space.
843.599
844.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
846.226
It's not a competition.
847.394
# HOWARD
847.603
You're right, you're right.
848.896
849.104
I'm really proud of you,
and I'm gonna miss you when you're gone.
852.941
853.400
And space beats water.
855.611
855.900
**LOL**
# AMY
857.905
Rajesh, I thought Lucy was coming.
860.449
# RAJ
860.657
She is. She's just running a little late.
862.534
862.743
You know how it is, girls, always fussing about
their hair, their makeup, she'll be here.
867.456
867.664
Just give it a rest, okay?
869.124
869.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
871.919
Can I have your attention, everyone?
874.254
876.200
**LOL**
876.924
That's B-flat for those
who don't have perfect pitch.
879.802
880.500
**LOL**
881.637
I would like to propose a toast
to my best friend, Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
886.850
887.351
He has been presented
with a wonderful opportunity...
890.437
890.646
...and I couldn't be happier for him.
894.149
895.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
897.069
Thank you, Sheldon,
that must have been hard for you to say.
899.822
# SHELDON
900.280
Well, I mean it. I'm really happy for you.
903.450
904.535
And that's how you get
a toothpaste commercial. Cheers.
907.162
907.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
# PENNY
908.747
Cheers.
910.457
# HOWARD
912.000
That's really nice of you
to try to be happy for Leonard.
915.671
# SHELDON
915.879
Thank you.
917.526
# HOWARD
917.526
It must've killed you when I went to space.
919.174
919.800
**LOL**
923.679
Oh, no.
925.118
# HOWARD
925.118
Buddy, you okay?
926.557
929.810
Oh, man.
931.145
# BERNADETTE
931.353
What's going on?
932.729
# RAJ
933.814
Go ahead, read it.
935.607
# HOWARD
935.816
"Raj, I can't come to the party.
This is all just too much for me.
940.487
941.405
I don't think we should
see each other anymore. Sorry. Lucy."
946.994
# RAJ
948.704
Excuse me.
949.997
# PENNY
950.205
Raj, I'm so sorry.
951.665
# AMY
951.874
Me too.
953.459
# SHELDON
957.045
It did not kill me when you went to space.
960.048
960.100
**LOL**
963.510
Monkeys went to space.
965.721
965.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
970.392
Well, here we are.
972.060
# LEONARD
972.269
Yep.
973.729
974.900
**LOL**
974.563
I'm really gonna miss you.
976.064
# PENNY
976.273
I'm gonna miss you too.
977.816
# SHELDON
978.025
Penny, we're in the red zone.
980.027
980.700
**LOL**
981.278
The white zone
is for loading and unloading.
983.780
983.989
We're breaking the law.
986.200
986.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
986.408
There's no space in the white zone, so...
988.264
# LEONARD
988.264
Anyway...
990.120
990.746
...we can e-mail and I think
the phone connections are good.
993.540
991.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
993.749
You have to get out of the car now.
I'm not going to jail.
996.543
996.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
996.752
Would you just relax?
998.107
# SHELDON
998.107
Oh, I see a space in the white zone.
999.463
999.671
Quick, circle the airport.
1002.007
1001.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
1003.008
Did you bring enough inhalers?
1004.030
# LEONARD
1004.030
Yeah.
1005.052
# PENNY
1005.260
And extra Dramamine? You remember
what happened on It's a Small World.
1009.473
1009.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1010.432
I'm covered.
1011.245
# PENNY
1011.245
Okay.
1012.059
# SHELDON
1012.267
Dear Lord, a police officer
is glancing in our direction.
1014.895
1015.103
We've been made.
1016.855
1016.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1018.565
Calm down, I'm getting out.
1020.776
1021.276
I have something I want to give you.
1022.569
# PENNY
1022.569
Oh, Leonard.
1023.862
# SHELDON
1024.071
It's a locket with Leonard's face in it.
1025.906
1026.114
He got it at the mall on clearance.
Move, move, move!
1028.575
1028.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
1031.078
I love you.
1032.287
# LEONARD
1033.372
I love you too.
1035.290

**LOL**
# SHELDON
1037.793
Don't worry, officer, they just love
each other, we're not smuggling drugs.

Hey. I'm coming back from the airport.
I wanted to see how you're doing.

That's very nice of you.
Come, come. Come on in.
1063.819
# PENNY
1064.820
I can't stay long. I left Sheldon in
the car with the window cracked open.
1068.615
1069.300
**LOL**
1070.826
He's gonna go through that
activity book in, like, 30 seconds, so...
1074.705
1074.500
**LOL**
1076.456
Are you okay?
1077.541
# RAJ
1079.751
No.
1081.211
# PENNY
1082.838
I'm so sorry.
1084.965
# RAJ
1086.216
It's my fault.
1087.676
1087.884
I finally found someone who's right for me
and I drove her away.
1092.973
# PENNY
1094.182
Raj.
1095.684
# RAJ
1096.852
Penny...
1098.353
1098.645
...I miss her already.
1100.439
# PENNY
1100.981
I know how you feel. I miss Leonard too.
1103.984
# RAJ
1104.234
What's--'?
1105.527
1105.736
What is wrong with me?
Why can't I ever have love?
1109.448
# PENNY
1109.656
You will.
1112.472
# RAJ
1112.472
No, I won't, I'm unlovable.
1115.287
# PENNY
1115.495
That's just the booze talking.
1117.581
# RAJ
1117.789
No, it's not.
I haven't had a drink since last night.
1121.877
1124.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
1131.178
You're talking to me.
1132.971
# RAJ
1133.180
I am.
1134.035
1134.035
Aah!
1134.890
1135.891
And now I'm crying
for a whole different reason.
1138.018
# PENNY
1138.226
Me too.
1139.519
1139.700
**LOL**
1146.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
1146.068
So I guess what I'm saying is,
I get where Lucy's coming from.
1149.363
# PENNY
1149.571
That's great. Do you want some wine?
1150.885
# RAJ
1150.885
No, water is fine.
1152.199
1152.407
Anyhow, I've been thinking about it a lot,
and I totally see why Lucy did what she did.
1157.871
1153.200
**LOL**
1158.080
I pushed too hard, but if I back off
and give her enough space...
1161.333
1161.800
**LOL**
1161.541
...maybe there's still a future for us.
1163.877
1164.086
The funny thing about life
is that sometimes something you think...
1167.255
1166.100
**LOL**
# AMY
1167.464
Does he ever shut up?
1169.383
# RAJ
1169.591
But then it turns good again
and that means it's better...
1172.191
1170.500
**LOL**
1172.386
...than if it had never been bad a while.
1174.221
1174.800
**LOL**
1174.429
And now things aren't good.
They are in fact...
1178.016
1178.642
...very, very bad...
1179.685
1179.900
**LOL**
1179.893
...but at least my heart is starting
to heal. Slowly, but surely.
1184.356
1184.564
How I cried, it was like a
little thunderstorm on my face.
1188.735
1186.500
**LOL**
1188.944
But I'm a man, okay?
So I need to pull myself together...
1191.738
1191.947
...pick up a pen and get it all out
in my journal. I mean...
1194.908
1194.100
**LOL**
1195.117
...it's not all bad. Having my heart broken
has allowed me to speak in front of you...
1199.079
1202.300
**LOL**
