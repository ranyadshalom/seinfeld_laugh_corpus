You're wrong.
4.046
# HOWARD
4.046
No, I'm not.
4.672
# RAJ
4.839
Yes, you are.
5.965
# HOWARD
5.965
No, I'm not.
7.091
7.258
Settle this. Those little animated pictures on
the Internet. Are they called gifs or "jifs"?
11.721
# LEONARD
11.888
Well, the G stands for "graphic,"
so that's a hard G, so I'd say gif.
15.225
# RAJ
15.391
The guy who invented it says it's "jif."
18.520
# HOWARD
18.520
I'm sorry, do you mean the guy or the "juy"?
21.648
21.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
22.941
Well, I'll give you three guesses
why I'm so irritated.
26.986
# HOWARD
27.153
Something happened different
from the way you wanted it.
30.490
# SHELDON
31.866
I guess news travels fast.
33.451
33.700
**LOL**
34.869
It's true. A select group of scientists
was invited to a weekend symposium...
38.414
38.581
...at a former home of Richard Feynman,
and I wasn't included.
41.543
# LEONARD
41.709
Oh. Sheldon, I'm sure it's not because
they don't think you're an elite scientist.
46.172
# HOWARD
46.339
Yeah, I bet you anything
it's just because you're a pain in the ass.
49.676
49.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
50.677
You're just saying that
to make me feel better.
52.845
52.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
54.264
You can spend the rest of the day
being bitter
56.432
# SHELDON
56.599
Agreed.
58.226
# LEONARD
59.143
I was gonna say "or," but why bother?

# BERNADETTE

Hey, Raj.
90.341
# RAJ
90.341
Hey. I got you a little gift.
92.093
# BERNADETTE
92.260
Wow, that's a lot of Girl Scout cookies.
94.512
# RAJ
94.679
You know me. I'm from India.
I can't resist children begging.
98.391
98.200
**LOL**
99.851
How's it going with the title to the house?
101.310
# HOWARD
101.310
Great. It's done.
102.770
102.937
The lawyer tracked down my father,
got him to sign it over.
105.607
105.773
I didn't have to meet him, didn't have to
talk to him. I don't even know where he is.
109.402
# RAJ
109.569
Wow. So you're not curious at all?
111.279
# HOWARD
111.279
Nope.
112.989
# RAJ
113.156
Huh. What if he's in prison?
114.616
115.450
What if he's a spy?
What if he's in a Beatles cover band?
119.078
119.200
**LOL**
120.455
I'm just saying,
if he's got your nose and haircut...
122.874
123.041
...he'd make a killer Ringo.
124.584
127.200
**LOL**
# WILWHEATON
127.462
Thanks for agreeing to do this.
129.359
# PENNY
129.359
It's cool. I've never been on a podcast before.
131.257
# LEONARD
131.424
Well, you picked a good one to start.
Wil's had lots of great guests.
134.552
134.719
Jonathan Frakes, Brent Spiner,
Michael Dorn, Gates McFadden.
138.681
# PENNY
138.848
Those are Star Trek people.
140.308
# LEONARD
140.308
Yes.
141.768
# PENNY
141.934
I only figured that out because I'd
never heard of any of them. Heh.
145.271
144.500
**LOL**
# WIL
146.064
I deserved that.
I invited you on my show and I drove here.
150.026
150.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
150.193
Sorry.
151.277
# WIL
151.444
Okay, so this is basically
just like a little talk show.
154.030
154.197
We're gonna take some calls, talk about what
it was like on the set of Serial Ape-ist 2.
158.409
158.576
It should be really fun.
159.577
# LEONARD
159.577
This is exciting.
160.578
# PENNY
160.745
Yeah. So how many people listen?
162.330
# WIL
162.497
Most people download it later,
but usually a few thousand listen live.
165.667
# PENNY
165.833
What? A few thousand people listen
to you talk about nerd stuff?
170.046
170.100
**LOL**
# WIL
171.964
Again, right in the ears,
straight to the feelings.
175.510
176.000
**LOL**
# AMY
178.763
Can you please pass the salt?
181.015
# SHELDON
181.557
Sure. Not like I was invited
to Richard Feynman's house...
184.894
185.061
...and have anything better to do.
187.397
187.100
**LOL**
# AMY
188.272
Is this how the rest of the night's gonna be?
190.358
# SHELDON
190.358
I don't know the future.
192.443
193.200
**LOL**
194.529
Do you think there's a chance
that an asteroid could hit the Earth...
197.740
197.907
...destroying Feynman's house
and everyone in it?
201.327
201.200
**LOL**
# AMY
202.412
No, Sheldon.
203.496
# SHELDON
203.663
Well, then, buckle up.
You're in for a cranky night.
206.874
206.000
**LOL**
# AMY
207.291
According to the codicil
of the relationship agreement...
209.919
210.086
...which you insisted upon, we're not
allowed to pout or be moody on date night.
213.840
# SHELDON
214.006
You know I just put that in
because of uterus stuff.
218.594
218.800
**LOL**
# AMY
219.929
Well, it applies to you too.
221.472
# SHELDON
222.390
I was afraid you might bring this up...
225.518
225.685
...so I have a work-around.
228.563
232.525
There you go.
234.277
233.800
**LOL**
239.073
As far as you're concerned, I'm smiling.
242.368
242.600
**LOL**
243.578
Though I admit I'm smiling a little
at the moment...
245.955
246.122
...because this loophole is so brilliant.
248.291
250.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
250.460
So, Bernadette, have you thought about
how you're going to redecorate this place?
254.756
# BERNADETTE
254.922
You know, I'm thinking,
ripping up the carpets...
257.759
257.925
...maybe lose the wallpaper,
all new light fixtures.
260.511
# RAJ
260.678
You know, if you knocked out this wall,
it would give you an open floor plan.
264.223
264.390
And then--
It's a little scary but could be fun.
268.352
268.519
Indoor fire pit.
271.105
270.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
273.483
Hey, I grew up in this house, okay?
No one's knocking anything down.
277.904
# BERNADETTE
278.070
Okay, okay.
279.489
279.655
When he's at Comic-Con,
I'm bringing in a wrecking ball.

289.457
# HOWARD
289.624
Yes.
291.000
# GUY
291.167
Um, this is a little weird.
A lawyer was trying to contact my father...
294.629
294.796
...because his name was still on the title
for this house.
297.423
# HOWARD
298.132
Well-- Who's your father?
299.884
# GUY
300.051
Sam Wolowitz.
301.761
# HOWARD
302.303
Oh.
303.513
303.679
Sam Wolowitz is my father.
305.180
# GUY
305.180
I know.
306.682
# HOWARD
308.309
Well, wait. So if we
have the same father...
311.604
312.814
I mean, are you saying
you're my half-brother?
314.899
# GUY
315.483
I think so.

# PENNY

I think I started to suspect
it was a bad movie...
327.161
327.328
...when I looked at the script
and saw the title...
330.998
331.200

...Serial Ape-ist 2:
Monkey See, Monkey Kill.

That voice you just heard belongs
to Leonard, Penny's fiancֳ©.
362.280

Why don't you grab headphones and join us?
363.677

Hello, caller. You are on with Penny
and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.

374.417
WOMAN : [don't have a question. I
just wanna say I'm a big fan of the movie.

time, but the other nine are on you.

Thanks, caller. You know the movie actually
has a little bit of a cult following?
389.432
# PENNY
389.599
Really?
390.913
# WIL
390.913
Yeah. I was at a science-fiction convention...
392.226
392.393
...and I saw a woman dressed
as your half-ape character.
395.229
# LEONARD
395.396
Oh, if she was with an Indian guy
dressed like a banana...
398.566
398.733
...that was just my friends Howard and Raj.
401.402
401.500
**LOL**
# WIL
403.237
It's time for a very special guest caller.
405.197
405.364
A friend of mine you probably know
as the director of such movies as Clerks...
409.118
409.285
...or from podcasts and books where he often
reminds you he's the guy who directed Clerks.
413.748
413.915
Hello, Kevin Smith.

**LOL**
# KEVN
415.291
KEVIN SMITH :
Hey, man, yo. ls everything okay, Wil?
417.835

Because it's been like two minutes and
you haven't even brought up Stand by Me.
422.924

Hey, Kevin, it's really exciting to talk to you.

# KEVIN
427.929
Oh, you guys are very sweet.
So, Penny, listen. I saw your movie.
430.973
# PENNY
431.140
Oh, wow, I wish it was better.
433.142
# WIL
433.309
Oh, don't worry about it.
Have you seen some of Kevin's films?

You're cruising for a beating, Wheaton.

thought you were, like, really great in it.
445.446
# PENNY

Aw.
446.510

Yeah, whatever. Penny...
449.200

450.534
Penny, how come you're not in more stuff?
I'd cast you in a minute.
453.955
# PENNY

Seriously?
454.872
# KEVIN
454.872
Oh, yeah, man.
455.623
455.790
I'm actually in preproduction
on a movie right now...
458.250
458.417
way different than anything I've ever
done before. It's called Clerks 3.
462.463
462.600
**LOL**
464.131
You should come over and read for a part.
466.050
# PENNY
466.050
Oh, my-- I would love that.
467.969
# LEONARD
468.135
You have a new job.
469.553
# PENNY
469.553
Well, maybe I could do both.
470.972

471.389
I don't think you can do both.
473.432

it stops feeling bad to be left out of things?
488.698
# AMY
489.156
Probably not.
490.616
490.783
It's an evolutionary advantage
to be included in group activities.

# SHELDON
495.162
You know what?
I used to be a fan of evolution...

502.086

Being left out is a terrible feeling.
No one understands that better than I do.

I can just picture them all right now
at Feynman's house.
528.446

Probably discussing Schrֳ¶dinger...
530.865
531.032
...and at the same time,
not discussing Schrֳ¶dinger.
533.993

on hilarious jokes like that.

Reminds me of when my stupid brother and

# AMY
551.719
You know, there's nothing I can do
about getting you invited to the symposium.
556.807
556.974
But if you wanted...
559.101
559.268
...we could build a fort.

Isn't that a little juvenile?

No. It means a diversified portfolio

I'm not overly conservative. I'm young. So
my guy said I can afford to take some risks.

...against Penny resuming her acting
career, but now you're all for it.
957.166

1006.715
# AMY
1006.715

...we suspend the date-night parameters
and you stay later?

# AMY
1040.832
Well, as long as we're suspending
the parameters...
1044.211
1045.212
...l could stay really late,
and we could have our first sleepover.

1050.884
That's a big step.
