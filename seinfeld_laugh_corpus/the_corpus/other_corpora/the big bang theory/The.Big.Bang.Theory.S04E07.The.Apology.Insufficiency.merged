Who knows?
676.426
676.593
I haven't watched
any scary movies recently.
679.221

I'm no longer obsessing
over why the predicted mass...
682.015
682.182
...of the quantum vacuum has little
effect on the expansion of the universe.
685.894

that accidental sip of Red Bull.

that's bothering you?

# SHELDON
693.026
Well, I did mention the Mars Rover
incident to that FBI agent...
696.947
697.114
...and probably cost Howard
his security clearance.
699.700
# LEONARD
699.866
What?
701.284
# SHELDON
701.284
Yeah, but why should that keep me up?
702.703
702.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
703.370
Because you feel guilty?
704.871
# SHELDON
705.622
Interesting.
707.124
707.291
So you're saying my insomnia
is caused by a guilty conscience?
711.378
# LEONARD
711.545
Actually, you don't have insomnia.
You're sleeping now.
714.423
# SHELDON
714.631
Excuse me?
716.174
# LEONARD
716.174
You're having a guilt-ridden dream.

# SHELDON
717.884
Do you have any evidence
to support that hypothesis?
720.387

720.595
How about that Gorn
sitting on the couch?
722.889
726.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
726.893
That seems fairly conclusive.
729.563

766.350
...about Howard's many excellent

769.978
770.145
...back in his favor. Ahem.
"Howard Joel Wolowitz.
772.981

H is for 'honesty, '
of which he has much.

I don't understand why you people

796.807
796.963
...when there are much more serious
security threats to pursue.
799.466
799.633
For instance,
when I first met Leonard...
801.635
801.802
...he was on the verge of giving away
rocket secrets to a North Korean spy...
805.514
805.900

I'm quite familiar with Dr. Tyson.

He's responsible for the demotion
of Pluto from planetary status.
836.336
836.503
I liked Pluto...

841.154
# DRTYSON

That was a vote of

If ifs and buts were candy and nuts,

Yes, but before you get upset...
869.578
869.744
...l want you to know I went to the FBI
and retracted my statement.
872.873
# HOWARD
873.415
And they were okay with that?
875.459
# SHELDON
875.667
No. If anything, I made it worse.
877.461
877.800
**LOL**
878.462
In any case,
I have been riddled with guilt...
881.465

Now, you say, "Apology accepted"...

a one-time-only high five.
