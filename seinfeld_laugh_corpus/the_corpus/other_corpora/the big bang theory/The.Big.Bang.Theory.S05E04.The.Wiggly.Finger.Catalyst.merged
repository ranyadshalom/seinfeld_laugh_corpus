The entrance to the dungeon
is a moss-covered door.
6.591
6.758
You manage to open it
only to find yourself face-to-face...
9.969
10.136
...with a hideous,
foul-smelling, moss-covered ogre.
13.765
13.932
What do you do?

# HOWARD
15.850
I say, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?"

Seventeen.
23.316

The ogre is amused by your joke
and allows you to pass.

Great. Spent five hours last night
at Macy's registering for gifts.

I'm finally gonna have that earthenware
asparagus dish I've always wanted, heh.

See, this is the good thing about
having a girlfriend 9000 miles away.
46.506

# HOWARD
49.217
Like playing nerd games with us...
50.927

...and then taking
a suspiciously long shower?

Maybe.

You see a dragon.
64.732
# HOWARD
65.358
Really?
So we're playing Dungeons and Dragons.
67.527
67.694
And we walk into a dungeon
and see a dragon?

Your movies and your TV shows...
109.819

blonde women with big bazongas.

126.356
Unh, I don't know if I wanna play anymore.
128.463
# SHELDON
129.088
Because you don't have a girlfriend?
If that becomes a reason...
132.175
132.383
...not to play Dungeons and Dragons,
this game's in serious trouble.

Yeah, but her husband
is in serious congestive heart failure...

he's in the placebo group.

# SHELDON
233.818
Yes. From here on in...
235.778
235.987
...I've decided to make all trivial
decisions with a throw of the dice.
239.490
239.657
Thus freeing up my mind
to do what it does best...

...I'm going to make a joke
about her being deaf.
382.466
383.300

490.282
...l tried to start a boy band
called Frankie Goes to Bollywood.

495.100
**LOL**
498.249
But I couldn't get any other boys
to join...

500.751
...so my parents asked the servants
to be my backup dancers.
504.422
504.600
**LOL**
504.588
Wait, when you sign servants,
don't sign it like I'm bragging.
507.591
507.758
Sign it in a way that I sound humble,
with just a hint of:
510.636

"That's right, I had servants."

I actually have information about Raj that
would be helpful with this discussion.

# LEONARD
706.874
Could you tell us?
708.459
# SHELDON
709.043
Let's see.
710.961

712.504
Snake eyes. Sorry, bud.

# PENNY

Wait. Hang on. Doubles. Roll again.
718.469
# SHELDON
722.264
Okay, get this.
724.308
724.000
**LOL**
725.392
It doesn't matter
if he's showering her with gifts...
727.478
727.645
...because the Koothrappalis
are vastly wealthy.
730.522
# PENNY
731.649
What do you mean "vastly wealthy"?
733.525
# SHELDON
733.525
Well, "wealthy" means a lot of money.
735.402
735.569
"Vastly" means even more.
I'm not sure what's tripping you up.
738.614
739.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
739.490
I know they have money.
I don't think it's that much.
741.951
# SHELDON
742.117
No, you're wrong.
As you know, a few years ago...
744.828
744.995
...l achieved one of my lesser dreams
and became a notary public.
748.582
748.749
Well, from time to time,
I notarize banking documents for Raj.
753.462
753.629
The Koothrappalis aren't just rich,
they're Richie Rich rich.
758.050
758.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
759.635
Well, so how much is that?
761.387
# SHELDON
761.553
About halfway between Bruce Wayne
and Scrooge McDuck.
765.015
765.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
766.433
The last time we went to the zoo...
768.227
768.394
...that son of a bitch
made me buy him a churro.
771.272
771.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
772.022
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude
but I need to go call Raj's sister...
775.484
775.651
...who I love so much.
777.653
777.820
Ahem, so vastly much.
781.448
781.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
783.867
Okay, so he's got money,
and it's a few gifts, and a car.
787.997
# HOWARD
788.163
And she got him
to pay off all her credit cards.
790.749
# PENNY
790.916
What? He paid off her credit cards?
793.502
793.669
Damn it, I could have dated Raj
for a couple months.
796.380
796.600
**LOL**
798.048
But I wouldn't have because I'm not that
kind of girl. We should really talk to Raj.
802.261
801.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
802.720
He's not gonna listen, he's in love.
805.055
# SHELDON
805.222
Can't figure out what to do?
I remember those days.
808.642
808.500
**LOL**
808.809
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to...
812.271
812.980
...stay right here.
814.982
814.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
818.902
This is a bad idea. We should go.
819.653
# PENNY
819.653
No.
820.404
820.571
I'm the one that introduced him to her.
I've gotta say something.
823.365
# HOWARD
826.910
Wow.
828.412
828.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
829.997
You're engaged to my friend.
831.498
# HOWARD
831.498
Hey, Bernadette doesn't mind...
833.000
833.167
...where I get my motor running,
as long as I park in the right garage.
837.129
837.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
839.340
I can't believe you're engaged
to my friend.
841.967
842.600
**LOL**
844.345
Oh, here she comes.
845.763
# HOWARD
845.929
Smart. Whisper,
so the deaf chick can't hear you.
849.141

Oh, hey. Hi. Nice to see you.
856.440
# PENNY
856.607
Um, can we talk to you about Raj?
859.860
# HOWARD
860.652
She says, "Sure, what about him?"
862.446
# PENNY
862.613
Okay. Um, gosh, how do I start?
864.990
863.400
**LOL**
865.157
Um, see, Raj is kind of naive.
869.036
869.203
He hasn't dated
a whole lot of women.
871.163
871.330
And I'm concerned that,
without meaning to...
874.583
872.300
**LOL**
874.750
...you might be taking advantage
of him.
876.877
877.500
**LOL**
877.044
By letting him buy you
a bunch of expensive things.
879.505
879.671
I-- Howard, focus.
882.800
882.100
**LOL**
883.133
Tell her what I'm saying.
883.947
# HOWARD
883.947
Right.
884.760
884.927
Are you a gold digger or not?
886.387
886.800
**LOL**
889.139
Oh, something, something. Who
the something do you think you are?
892.393
892.559
Mind your own something business
and go something yourself.
896.188
896.200
**LOL**
897.398
Oh, ha, ha, wait, I got this now.
900.025

# RAJ
903.695
I'm so mad at you.
904.613
# PENNY
904.613
Okay, wait.
905.531
# RAJ
905.697
How dare you ambush my girlfriend
at the gym?
907.950
# PENNY
908.158
We didn't mean for it
to be an ambush.
909.910
910.077
It's kind of impossible not to sneak up
on deaf people.
913.455
913.300
**LOL**
914.790
And, hey,
since when are you so chatty?
917.126
# RAJ
917.292
I'm hammered.

# PENNY
918.564
Raj, come here.
919.837
920.379
This girl is trouble.
922.840
923.006
What kind of relationship is it where
you buy her gifts and she gives you sex?
926.969
# RAJ
927.469
The best one I've ever had.
929.680
929.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
931.515
Okay, come on,
you know you can do better.
933.684
# RAJ
934.351
Aha!
936.061
936.228
I see what's going on here.
937.855
938.564
You and I had our crazy night
together.
940.983
941.191
And now you can't stand to see me
with another woman.
943.694
944.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
943.861
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
945.070
# RAJ
945.237
It's okay,
I can't get mad at your feelings.
947.114
# PENNY
947.281
I don't have feelings.
948.449
# RAJ
948.615
Yeah, that's good.
Keep telling yourself that.

He is cuter now that I know he's rich.

I have a surprise for you.
Cover your eyes.
963.213
966.717
Open them.
968.635
970.500
**LOL**
977.144
It's a real ruby.
979.271
979.938
It was a little expensive,
but no one can put a price on love.
985.986
986.153
Although the people at Cartier
took a pretty good shot at it.
989.239
988.800

Oh, Mummy, Daddy,
what a nice surprise.

She told us you're spending all our money
on your new girlfriend.

# RAJ

1011.470

Yeah, yeah. I'm a gynecologist.
I know exactly what she gives you.
1017.392

**LOL**
1018.769
You need to find a nice Indian girl
from a good family.
1021.980
1022.147
If you keep seeing this woman,
you're cut off.
1024.316
# RAJ
1024.483
What? You're gonna make me choose
between the woman I love...
1027.194
1027.361
...and the money
I have very strong feelings for?
1031.073
1031.100

# DRKOOTHRAPPALI
1032.032
It's up to you.

# RAJ
1059.393
My, uh, parents are making me choose
between money and you.
1063.397
1064.523
I choose you.
1066.567
1069.236
No. I think we'll have to return
the car.
1071.822
1073.323
And the necklace. Yeah, that too.
1075.450
1075.617
But none of those things matter
because we have something better.
