This old guy was choking on his food
and I saved his life.
9.349
# LEONARD
9.557
Did you Heimlich him?
10.683
# PENNY
10.892
No, I said,
"I think that old guy's choking."
13.269
13.478
Then one of the busboys Heimlich'd him.
15.688
15.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
17.732
You're a hero.
19.400

# PENNY

Yeah, that was the point of the story.

# LEONARD
23.821
Do you know
if you have Thursday night off?
26.241
# PENNY
26.449
Uh, I think so, why?
27.825
# LEONARD
28.076
Why? It's Valentine's Day.
29.786
# PENNY
29.994
Oh, right.
Yeah, we can do something.

You could be a little more into it.
35.187
# PENNY
35.187
I'm into it, I'm into it.
36.793
37.001
There's pressure to make the night special

# LEONARD
40.338
Well, this time it's gonna be different
because I'm like a romance ninja. Heh.

You don't see it coming and then-- Barn!
Romance! Watch out! Hearts, kisses, love!

# PENNY
52.767
Sometimes I think I've made you
cooler than you used to be...
55.520
55.728
...then you go
and do that.
56.938
59.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
59.691
So in conclusion,
I believe the painful sensation felt...
63.736
63.945
...after passing a meal
of spicy chilies is proof...
66.906
67.115
...that the rectum does possess
the sense of taste.

# AMY

I concur, but you changed the subject.
What are we doing for Valentine's Day?

Bernie's a little cranky since

# STUART
147.070
Not really, other than hiding
all the sharp objects around here...
150.531
150.740
...and white-knuckling it till morning.
153.076
152.900
**LOL**
153.326
What do you got going on?
154.827
# RAJ
155.161
I was gonna spend the night
with my special little lady...
158.373
158.581
...but she got worms
and then I had to take her to the vet.
161.376
162.500
**LOL**
# STUART
165.213
There must be something
we can do.
166.714
# RAJ
166.923
Uh, how about, uh,
you keep the store open late...
170.009
170.218
...and we throw a party for people
who don't have dates?
172.762
173.262
That actually sounds kind of nice.
175.056
# RAJ
175.264
The theme will be that the greatest love
a man can have is love he has with himself.
180.395
180.500
**LOL**
# STUART
183.064
That's good...
184.190

a little less hand-in-the-pants.

I passed up an opportunity to work at

Well, I guess those chaps will have to have
someone else buy their girlfriends presents.

This is...

261.976
I was trying to come up with something
really romantic to give Bernadette...

You can't find a card that says that?

# HOWARD
276.866
Check it out. I used the atomic-force
microscope in the materials-science lab...
280.703
280.953
...and wrote our initials in a heart one
one-thousandth the size of a grain of sand.
286.334
# LEONARD
286.709
Oh, that's cool.
288.669

What are you and Penny doing?
313.194
# LEONARD
313.402
I'm gonna take her
to a nice restaurant for dinner.
315.738
# HOWARD
316.239
That's not bad, but as far as romance goes,
I think my gift hits it right out of the

340.800
**LOL**
# ALEX
341.848
Okay, I think I have some great choices.
343.766
344.225
I went on Amy's Facebook page
and read her interests
346.727
# SHELDON
346.936
See?
I never would've thought to do that.
349.897
350.700
**LOL**
351.274
Clearly I made a good choice
farming this out to you.
353.901
354.110
I'm telling you,
Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot.
356.404
356.612
Anyway...

Well, um, I know
she loves playing the harp...
367.957
368.666
...so I found this beautiful music box
that plays one of her favorite songs.
374.755
# SHELDON
377.758
Now, Amy already has a real harp...
379.802
381.262
...and it can play any song.

396.319
# ALEX
396.527
...so I found this cool map that illustrates
the characters' journey through England.
402.450
402.658
We could put it in a really nice frame.
404.952

# ALEX
423.220
Okay, well, uh, luckily
I saved the best for last.
427.141
427.808
Since Amy's a neuroscientist,
I did some research...
430.478
430.686
...found out that Santiago Ramֳ³n y Cajal,
the father of modern neuroscience...
434.774
434.982
...did lots of hand
drawings of brain cells.
437.485

And I managed to find this signed print.

Did he? No.

I told you Valentine's Day sucks.

This one does, and you're the reason why.

# BERNADETTE

Compared to them,
I'm feeling pretty good about us.

# HOWARD
723.520
Me too. How about we blow off dessert,
go home early? I'll do that laundry.
728.359
725.900
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
728.692
Thank you.
729.735

I love you.

Love you too.

# HOWARD

So where'd you hide it?
735.324
# BERNADETTE
735.324
Where you'd never look.

# HOWARD
737.618
Damn it, it's in the washing machine.

Hello.
749.588
# AMY
750.130
Happy Valentine's Day.
751.673
# SHELDON
751.673
Okay.
753.217
753.200
**LOL**
756.011
Shall we go to dinner?
757.200
# AMY
757.200
Hang on.
758.389
758.597
As you know,
I had planned a traditional evening...
761.100
761.308
...of romance and gifts.
762.810
# SHELDON
763.018
Yes, and as you know,
I planned to pretend to enjoy it.
767.439
767.900
**LOL**
768.399
I've been working
on this facial expression all day.
771.902
772.800
**LOL**
# AMY
774.405
And I appreciate your effort...
776.073
776.282
...but upon contemplation,
I decided I was being selfish.
779.868
780.077
So I canceled our dinner reservations...
782.079
782.288
...and came up with an even better way
to celebrate Valentine's Day.
785.916
# SHELDON
786.125
What is that?
787.272
# AMY
787.272
By doing none of it.
788.419
788.836
No dinner, no romance, no gifts.
791.422
791.672
We stay here, order a pizza...
794.049
794.258
...and watch one
of your beloved Star War Trek things.
798.429
798.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
799.430
Really?
800.931
# AMY
801.140
That's what you'd love, isn't it?
802.850
# SHELDON
803.225
More than anything.
804.476
# AMY
804.852
Well, then, that's what we're gonna do.
808.314
809.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
810.274
Well, I don't know what to say.
813.444
814.069
This is the most thoughtful gift
that anyone's ever given me.
818.073
818.282
And that's including an amazing gift
I gave myself earlier today.
822.619
823.800
**LOL**
# AMY
824.455
I'm your girlfriend, that's my job.
826.498
826.707
I know gift-giving puts pressure on you
so whatever you got me, you can return.
833.172
# SHELDON
835.007
No.
836.508
836.967
After everything you didn't do
for me tonight, I want you to have it.
840.971
841.300
**LOL**
# AMY
842.056
What's this?
843.224
# SHELDON
843.224
Read it.
844.391
# AMY
845.059
"Sheldon Cooper,
Caltech University employee information"?
848.437
# SHELDON
848.645
At the bottom.
849.730
# AMY
850.022
"In case of emergency,
please contact Amy Farrah Fowler."
855.736
855.900

858.197
And there's my phone number.
860.616
860.200

This is the most beautiful gift
you could've ever given me.
867.081

# SHELDON
867.748
I thought if I have a stroke
or a kidney stone...
872.628
872.836
...who would I want to share that with?
875.381
874.800
**LOL**
# AMY
878.717
And you picked me.
881.011
880.900

881.845
It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.
883.930

Oh, Sheldon.

912.167
You know what?
913.210
913.752
That was pretty crappy of you.
915.129
915.337
All I wanted to do
was give you a great night...
917.506
917.714
...and it's like you went out of your way
to destroy it.
920.300
# PENNY
920.551
Yep. I know. I'm a total bitch.
922.198
# LEONARD

I'm not saying that.

Fine, you win, you're a bitch.

Why couldn't we just have a nice time?
931.228
# PENNY
931.728
I don't know.
933.647
933.856
Maybe because things are going so well
between us lately and I've been happy.
938.235
941.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
945.075
Okay, you're gonna have to make
a lot more sense than that.
947.995
948.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
948.620
Obviously,
I have some commitment issues.
951.790
# LEONARD
951.999
Glaringly obvious. Go on.
953.834
953.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
953.834
As long as things keep going great...
955.669
955.878
...you'll keep asking me to marry you.
Eventually, I'll end up saying yes.
959.298
959.506
Then we're gonna be married forever
and the whole thing just freaks me out.
963.510
# LEONARD
965.429
Okay.
967.097
967.764
I know I propose a lot.
970.476
971.000
**LOL**
974.438
So how about this?
976.940
977.608
I promise I will never ask you
to marry me again.
981.028
# PENNY
981.778
What do you mean?
Are you breaking up with me?
984.448
# LEONARD
984.656
No. No, no, no.
986.033
985.400
**LOL**
986.241
But if someday, you decide
you wanna get married...
989.369
989.620
...you have to propose to me.
991.455
# PENNY
992.122
Really?
992.831
# LEONARD
992.831
Yes.
993.540
994.124
It's all on you.
995.834
996.043
But when the time comes,
I want the whole nine yards.
998.754
998.962
I want you down on one knee, flowers.
I wanna be swept off my feet.
1002.466
1002.600

# PENNY
1004.968
Yeah, you got it.
1006.094

And I'm cool with surprises,
but nothing on a Jumbotron.
1009.473
1009.100

1010.766
I don't wanna cry on a
big screen like that.

This might be the wine talking, but I

Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?
1089.386
1087.700

1093.557
We're all here tonight
because we have no one to be with.
1098.061

But that doesn't make us mutants.

1103.233
The only mutants here
are in these comic books.
1105.902

We gotta stop defining our self-worth

You know what I see when I look around?
1117.497
1118.290
I see a room full of great people.
1119.958
1121.835
So let's give ourselves a break.
We are a community.
1126.715

And as long as we have each other,
we're never truly alone.

Sheldon, I'm not driving over there again.
1200.455
1200.664
Because I drove over there yesterday
for a brain tumor...

...that turned out to be
an ice-cream headache.

Yes, I still want to be
your emergency contact.
