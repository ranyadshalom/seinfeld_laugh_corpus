Well, it's very simple.
7.466
7.633
In our ragtag band of scientists
with nothing to lose...
10.636
10.803
...I'm the smart one.
Wolowitz is the funny one.
13.264

Koothrappali is the lovable foreigner...

Don't panic. This is better.

36.037
Oh, no. You didn't trade the food
for magic beans, did you?
39.415
39.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
40.625
Of course not. And, technically,
magic beans would be food.
44.003
44.170
Eating them would be a waste,
since you could plant them...
47.048
47.214
...and have a giant beanstalk which
would provide roughage for a small city.

They were closing up.

230.335
# LEONARD
230.335
Oh.
231.816
# RAJ
231.982
It's even got the Elvish engraving on it.
234.151
# SHELDON
234.318
It's not Elvish.
235.486

It's the language of Mordor

Hold on. Sheldon,
is there ketchup on that table?
263.138
# SHELDON
263.305
Yes, there is. Oh, here's a fun fact.
266.141
266.600
**LOL**
266.308
Ketchup started out as a general term
for sauce...
268.686
268.853
...typically made of mushrooms
or fish brine with herbs and spices.
272.189
272.356
Some popular early main ingredients
included blueberry, anchovy...
275.860
276.026
...oyster, kidney bean and grape.
279.363
279.800

# HOWARD

Listen, I was looking at the ring
and it seemed a little weird.
286.871
287.037
No copyright notice on it.
288.539
288.706
So I took it down to this buddy of mine
who deals with...

291.876
...shall we say, the seedy underbelly

Those are production markings.

Nine rings were made
for use in the movies.
350.893

Three were given to members
of the cast. The rest were destroyed.
354.772

Except one.
356.440

# SHELDON
374.124
Yes, but I found it in the box.
376.085
376.251
And the laws of maritime salvage
clearly state...
378.587

...that the finder of a sunken treasure
is the owner.

We can't sell it. We have to keep it
and love it and polish it.
423.674
423.841
Take it out occasionally
when we go to the park...

438.668
Fine.
