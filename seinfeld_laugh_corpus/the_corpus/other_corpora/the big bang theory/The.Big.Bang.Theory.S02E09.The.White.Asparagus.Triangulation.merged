Hey, Sheldon.
5.590
# SHELDON
6.382
What is shaking?
8.384
8.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
10.595
I'm sorry?
11.637
# SHELDON
11.804
It's colloquial. A conversation opener.
14.098
14.700
**LOL**
15.683
So do you find the weather satisfying?
18.060
18.227
Are you currently sharing in the triumph
of some local sports team?
22.106
# PENNY
22.815
What's wrong with you?
You're freaking me out.
25.610
24.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
25.776
I'm striking up a casual conversation
with you.
28.779
28.946
What's up?
30.781
30.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
35.369
Please don't do that.
37.288
36.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
37.538
But I'm given to understand that when
you have something awkward to discuss...
41.292
41.459
...it's more palatable
to preface it with banal chitchat.
44.211
44.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
45.963
So this wasn't the awkward part?
48.633
48.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
50.593
No.
52.219
51.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
54.013
Oh. All right.
56.223
# SHELDON
56.390
What's up?
58.392
57.900
**LOL**
59.685
Oh, good, I used that right.
62.146
61.800
**LOL**
62.647
Anyway, you're aware that Leonard has
entered into a new romantic relationship...
66.734
66.901
...which includes a sexual component.
69.695
69.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
71.989
Okay, feeling the awkward now.
73.657
# SHELDON
73.657
Wait.
75.326
74.600
**LOL**
75.993
Her name is Dr. Stephanie Barnett.
77.578
77.745
And she's a highly distinguished
surgical resident at Fremont Memorial.
81.082
# PENNY
81.248
Yeah, Leonard told me.
81.868
# SHELDON
81.868
Good.
82.488
82.583
What he may have left out is how
important this relationship is to me.
87.421
87.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
88.964
To you?
89.486
# SHELDON
89.486
Yes.
90.007
90.174
See, of the handful of women
Leonard's been involved with...
93.094
93.260
...she's the only one
I have ever found tolerable.
96.263
96.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
100.935
Well, what about me?
102.603
# SHELDON
103.396
The statement stands for itself.
105.648
105.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
107.900
Well, aren't you sweet?
109.235
# SHELDON
109.402
Anyway, should you have
any interaction with her...
111.737
111.904
...it would be most helpful
that she not see you as a sexual rival.
116.283
116.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
117.618
Yeah, I think she's pretty safe.
119.870
# SHELDON
120.037
You say that now,
but consider the following scenario.
122.998
123.165
You're sitting in your apartment.
It's late. You're alone.
126.127
126.293
Your hypothalamus is swimming in
a soup of estrogen and progesterone...
129.839
129.900
**LOL**
130.005
...and, suddenly, even Leonard
seems like a viable sexual candidate.
135.302
135.200
**LOL**
137.138
Or a hookup,
as it's referred to by today's urban youth.
141.475
140.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
141.642
Really?
142.288
# SHELDON
142.288
Yes.
142.935
143.102
Now, should that happen, I would ask you
to find some way to suppress your libido.
147.940
148.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
150.818
I could think about you.
153.529
153.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
155.781
Fine. Whatever works.
157.908
# PENNY
159.452
Always nice talking to you, Sheldon.
161.829
# SHELDON
161.996
Peace out.
163.748

# LEONARD
201.827
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
203.788
# SHELDON
203.954
And you said there would never
be enough pasta for the three of us.
207.792
207.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
207.958
I stand corrected.
209.627
# SHELDON
209.794
You know,
Italian housewives have a rule of
212.421
212.588
A handful of dry pasta
about an inch in diameter...
215.174
215.341
...is sufficient for each person,
as it doubles in volume when cooked.
220.054
219.800
**LOL**
# STEPH
220.596
That's very interesting.
221.722
# SHELDON
221.889
Thank you.
223.641
# LEONARD
223.641
She doesn't mean it. She's just being nice.
225.392
225.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
227.394
Well, Stephanie, since Leonard seems
to be dropping the conversational ball...
231.023
231.190
...l guess I'll just have to pick it up.
Ahem.
233.651
237.200
**LOL**
241.033
Have you ever witnessed a violent crime?
243.744

# STEPH
246.288
No.
247.101
# SHELDON
247.101
Good.
247.915
248.082
What's your favorite fruit?
249.333
249.333
It, uh
250.584
250.600
**LOL**
# STEPH
251.252
Strawberries.
252.294
# SHELDON
252.461
Mm, technically not a fruit, but all right.
254.547
254.700
**LOL**
256.674
Where did you do
your medical internship?
258.759
# STEPH
258.926
Uh, Lawrence Memorial
in Galveston, Texas.
261.095
# SHELDON
261.262
Really? That's where I was born.
263.264
264.900

# STEPH
265.933
You're kidding.
266.601
# SHELDON
266.601
No.
267.268
267.434
I spent so much of my childhood
at that hospital. It
270.229
270.396
When I was 12,
I got to ride there in a helicopter.
273.440
273.400
**LOL**
# STEPH
274.108
What? What happened?
275.714
# SHELDON
275.714
Radiation burns.
277.319
277.000
**LOL**
277.486
A little mishap
while I was building my own CAT scanner.
280.447
280.800
**LOL**
# STEPH
281.115
I'm sorry, you tried to build
your own CAT scanner?
283.868
# SHELDON
284.034
No, I didn't try, I succeeded.
285.995
286.100
**LOL**
286.161
I was briefly able to see the inside
of my sister's guinea pig, Snowball...
289.790
289.957
...before he caught fire.
291.959
291.200
**LOL**
292.668
It led to an interesting expression
in our
294.962

Not a Snowball's chance
in a CAT scanner.

Uh, Sheldon.
301.719
# SHELDON
302.386
Excuse me.
303.470
304.388
When I come back, just for fun,
the subject will be alternative history.
307.808
307.975
Specifically, how would the Civil War
have gone differently...
310.686
310.853
...if Lincoln had been
a robot sent from the future?
313.439
313.600

318.611
Look at that, there's even pasta left over.
321.822

Do you understand
that this was supposed to be a date?
324.909
# SHELDON
325.075
I do. Do you?
326.619
326.785
Because, frankly, you've been
in a foul mood since I sat down.
329.914
331.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
333.334
Okay, here's my
335.336
335.502
Why did you sit down?
337.671
337.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
338.339
To help.
Look, if you fail at this relationship...
341.508
341.675
...and history suggests you will...
343.469
344.000
**LOL**
345.012
...then we risk losing the medical officer
that our landing party has always needed.
349.600

right in the guy's chest

One of my earrings.

385.427
# STEPH

386.887
387.054
I discreetly slipped off
the other earring...
388.931
389.098
...put it in my pocket,
and then got the hell out of there.

I'm sorry I'm late, but your companion
left the most indecipherable invitation.

403.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
404.029
What invitation?
405.990
# SHELDON

"We're going to the movies."

409.243
What movie? What theater? What time?
411.912
412.100

413.664
If you were trying to make it impossible to
locate you, you couldn't have done better.
417.668
# LEONARD
417.835
Oh, clearly, I could have.
420.587
420.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
421.213
It took 20 minutes to go through...
422.840
423.007
...the browser history on your computer
to see what movie times you looked up.
426.760
426.700
**LOL**
427.761
Wait here, I'll find us seats.
429.346
# STEPH

# LEONARD

"Stephanie Barnett is single."

# SHELDON
523.231
Yeah, furthermore...

...earlier this evening, she threw
a digital sheep at some guy named Mike.

We're losing her.

557.474
...in anything that happens
between me and Stephanie.

It's my understanding
that an unsolicited gift of food...

If I have any hope
of keeping them together, I need data.

More to the point, it's about finding a way
to keep Leonard and Stephanie together.
721.638
# HOWARD
721.805
Oh, I don't think you can.
723.035
# SHELDON
723.035
Why not?
724.266
# HOWARD
724.433
Look at Leonard's record.
Twenty-seven days with Joyce Kim.
727.602
# RAJ
727.769
During which she defected
to North Korea.
730.314
730.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
731.064
Two booty calls with Leslie Winkle.
733.191
# RAJ
733.358
For which she awarded him the nickname
Speed-of-Light Leonard.
736.236
736.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
737.779
And a three-hour dinner with Penny.
739.698
# RAJ
739.865
Which would've been two and a half if they
ordered the souffle when they sat down.
743.660
743.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
743.910
Based on the geometric progression...
745.662
745.829
...his relationship with Stephanie
should have ended after 20 minutes.
749.291
749.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
749.458
Yes, I'm aware of the math.
750.751
750.917
Y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth.
753.128
753.295
The issue remains.
754.880
755.100
**LOL**
755.881
How do we circumvent
his inevitable rejection?
758.467
# RAJ
758.633
Well, if you want to guarantee his appeal
to Stephanie...
760.969
761.136
...your best bet would be
to kill all the other men on the planet.
764.556
764.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
766.475
I'll tell you what you shouldn't do.
That body spray...
769.102
769.269
...where the women undress
when they smell it?
771.355
771.521
That doesn't work at all.

815.649
815.816

crossed some sort of line.
819.027

Where are you in your menstrual cycle?
830.956

**LOL**
# PENNY
833.959
What?
835.273
# SHELDON
835.273
I've been doing some research online...
836.586
836.753
...and, apparently, female primates--
You know, uh, apes, chimpanzees, you.
842.050
841.600
**LOL**
842.551
They find their mate more desirable
when he's courted by another female.
845.887
846.054
Now, this effect is intensified
when the rival female...
848.807
848.974
...is secreting the pheromones
associated with ovulation.
851.601
851.768
Which brings me back to my question.
Where are you in--?
854.813
854.100
**LOL**
857.566
Clearly, I'm 14 days too early.

All I'm saying is, if they can
cure yellow fever and malaria...

about lactose intolerance?

Leonard, you're gonna have to let this go.

When I fail to open this and you succeed,
it will establish you as the alpha male.
925.842
926.009
You see, when a female witnesses
an exhibition of physical domination...
929.846
930.013
...she produces the hormone oxytocin.
931.932
932.098
If the two of you engage in intercourse,
this will create the biochemical reaction...
936.061
936.228
...which laypeople naively interpret
as falling in love.
