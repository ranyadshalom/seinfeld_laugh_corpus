So if you are considering
going into experimental physics...
5.047
5.214
...my door is always open.
7.008
7.174
Again, I'm sorry that the demonstration
didn't quite work out.
10.011

Now we know what happens...

...when you accidentally spill peach
Snapple into a helium-neon laser.

74.659
74.825
Of course, I was 14...

Now, there may be one or two of you
in this room who has what it takes...
87.838
88.005
...to succeed in theoretical physics.
90.132
90.299
It's more likely that you will spend
your careers teaching fifth graders...

I liked your paper on grand unification
using string-network condensates...
243.994
244.161
...and was wondering how you determined
that three-dimensional string nets...
