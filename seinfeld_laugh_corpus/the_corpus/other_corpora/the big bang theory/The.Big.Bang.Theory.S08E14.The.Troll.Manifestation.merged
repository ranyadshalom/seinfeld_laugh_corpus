So tell me about your day.
How's it going with the particle detector?
7.008
# LEONARD
7.175
Wow, you remember that?
8.676
# PENNY
8.885
Yeah, I listen to what you say.
10.303
10.512
You're building a particle detector
using superfluid helium.
14.015
# LEONARD
14.224
You know, when you talk like that I want
to take you right here on this table.
17.894
17.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
18.895
You know from experience
this table cannot support both our weight.
21.981
22.600
**LOL**
23.525
So how's the detector going?
25.652
# LEONARD
25.860
It's tricky working with superfluids.
27.779
27.987
Whatever container you put them in, they creep
up the sides and crawl out on their own.
32.075
# PENNY
32.283
Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.
34.577
34.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
34.786
Exactly. Except you don't have
a lunatic running around
37.705
37.914
"I fed you sugar water.
Why are you biting me?"
40.416
40.600
**LOL**
40.667
Ha.
41.709
42.502
You really want to talk about this?
44.212
# PENNY
44.420
I do. I didn't write "superfluid helium"
on this napkin for nothing.
48.216
48.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
49.300
Okay, well, this is cool. There's a thing
called superfluid vacuum theory...
54.013
54.222
...where empty space is imagined
as a superfluid with all of its
57.850
58.059
Viscosity, density, surface tension...
60.853
# PENNY
62.939
If you're pausing for dramatic effect,
I'd keep it moving.
66.818
66.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
67.485
No, no.
69.279
71.030
People don't talk about surface tension.
72.865
74.075
If you imagine our three-space...
76.411
76.619
...as the surface of an N-dimensional
superfluid bubble...
79.789
79.998
This is exciting.
83.001
83.209
This is really exciting.
I have to go find Sheldon.
86.087
# PENNY
86.296
Okay, well, if you find him,
use the kitchen island.
89.340
87.900
**LOL**
89.549
That coffee table
will not support both of you.
92.176
92.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
94.887
Which means a spherical
multidimensional superfluid...
97.473
97.682
...shows the same
negative energy density as space-time.
99.882
100.059
What do you think? So, what do you think?

# LEONARD

I know this isn't my area,

119.370
119.579
...but could this be something?
121.331
# SHELDON
124.500
Well, you could've set
Newton's gravitational constant to one.
128.296
128.504
And the whole thing reeks of blueberry. You
know I can't stand these scented markers.
133.384
133.000

No one told you to taste them.

# SHELDON

It's good.
143.019

You do? Not messing with me?
147.399
# SHELDON
147.399
Not at all.
148.483
148.691
In fact, I have got something
for just such an occasion.
152.028
152.236
I was starting to think I might never
get a chance to give it to you.
155.448
156.199
Good job.

For a man whose last observation...

210.128
...was our universe may be the surface of
a multidimensional supercooled liquid...
213.881
214.090
..."you're still awake" seems
like quite the sophomore slump.

You worked out all the math.
220.555
# SHELDON
220.763
Oh, I did more than work out all the math.
223.266
223.474
I wrote a paper.

# LEONARD

I wrote a paper on our idea.
231.774
# LEONARD
231.983
When did my idea become our idea?
234.235
# SHELDON
234.444
When I mixed it with Sheldony goodness...
237.113
237.321
...and cooked it
in the Easy-Bake Oven of my mind.
240.074
240.200

Only way we'll know for sure is if we
post it online to the pre-print server.

I have it ready to go,
but I wasn't gonna do it without you.

It's all happening so fast.
266.309

Should we sleep on it?

We could, but we always run the risk
