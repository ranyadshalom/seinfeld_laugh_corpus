Would it help...

Look, it's not just the wig.
93.886

Wait for my mom's heart to explode

It's inappropriate for a single woman

If you insist on talking,

All right, you may talk in the bedroom,
but I want this door to remain open.

527.152
527.319
...the duty of controlling
her base desires...

...falls to the closest male member
of her family, in this case, Raj.
533.867
534.600

534.034
The code also states
that if she disobeys...

...she will be reborn in the womb
of a jackal and tormented by diseases.
543.043
543.000

No, really, I am not upset

Your former boyfriend has replaced you
with a very suitable mate.

Arguably much more suitable than you.

Well, granted, Penny, you're secondary

...but Priya is highly educated,
she's an accomplished professional...
717.718
717.884
...she comes from the culture that wrote
the book on neat ways to have sex.
721.555
721.500
**LOL**
722.723
You, on the other hand,
are a community-college dropout...

# AMY

This is a portable

737.571
737.738
I'm doing research on emotions
and brain activity.
740.115
740.282
When you start crying, I can see
which region of the brain is activated.
744.244
744.000

744.911
Then I'll stimulate the analogous area
in a rhesus monkey and see if he cries.

Uh, she's currently helping set up
a secondary derivative market...
