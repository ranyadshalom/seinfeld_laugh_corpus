On the other hand, some physicists are

I don't think so.
I followed her here from the parking lot.

Excuse me?

# SHELDON
123.499
She's my twin sister.
124.750
124.917
She thinks she's funny, but frankly,
I've never been able to see it.
128.254
# MISSY
128.421
That's because you have
no measurable sense of humor, Shelly.
131.215
# SHELDON
131.382
How exactly would one measure
a sense of humor?
133.884
134.051
A humormometer?
136.178
138.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
138.973
Well, I think you're delightfully droll.
Or as the French
142.351

# MISSY

Okay, so let me see if I got this.

So, Missy, what brings you
all the way from Texas?

Was it perhaps destiny?
I think it was destiny.

# MISSY
216.884
And I had to drop off some papers
for Shelly to sign for my dad's estate.
220.262
# SHELDON
220.429
The papers could've been mailed. Mom
sent you here to spy on me, didn't she?
223.933
# MISSY
224.099
I guess that's why
they call you a genius.
226.393
# SHELDON
226.560
They call me a genius
because I'm a genius.
229.230
229.800

Tell Mom
that I currently weigh 165 pounds...

If the Wedding's not till tomorrow,
why don't you stay with us tonight?
244.161
# MISSY
244.328
Oh, I don't think so.
Shelly doesn't like company.
247.289
247.456
Even as a little boy, he'd send his imaginary
friends home at the end of the day.
251.252
251.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
251.752
They were not friends.
They were imaginary colleagues.

Look, you're here,

Come on, Shelly, she's family.

So what?
I don't issue invitations to your mother.
265.641

# MISSY
266.100
It would be nice not to have to drive
to Anaheim in rush hour.
268.978

And don't ever call me Shelly.

271.355
So it's settled. You'll stay with us.

What just happened?

# MISSY
284.827
So anyway, we're 8 years old...
286.453
286.620
...and Sheldon converts my Easy-Bake Oven
to some kind of high-powered furnace.

That's just classic.

Anyway, I make those little muffins
they give you. There's a big flash.

my eyebrows are gone.

314.565
Not your eyebrows?

Yep, I had to go through
the entire second grade...
319.612
319.778
...with crooked eyebrows

# SHELDON
322.531
Is that what that was? I just assumed...

had rendered you quizzical.

She has the symmetry and low body fat
that Western culture deems desirable.
585.586
585.400
**LOL**
585.752
It's noteworthy that at other points
in history...
588.046

Ugh. It's...

# SHELDON
609.568
Oh. Okay. You know, I don't want

Whatever.
625.542

Because she's your sister.

Yes, we shared a uterus

Okay, consider this.
643.352
643.518
With your father gone,
it is your responsibility...

...to make sure
that Missy chooses a suitable mate.
650.567
# SHELDON

654.655
654.947
We do share DNA.
656.657
# LEONARD
# SHELDON
656.823
So there is the possibility,
however remote...
658.951
659.117
...that resting in her loins
is the potential for another individual...
662.496
662.663
...as remarkable as myself.

of your sister's future offspring.

# SHELDON

You're right. If someone wants
to get at Missy's fallopian tubes...
680.347
680.514
...they'll have to go through me.

I was judo champion at math camp.

# SHELDON

All right.
That's enough juvenile squabbling.
703.578
703.745
You stop it. You stop it, I say.
705.831
706.400
**LOL**
707.124
I'm gonna settle this right now.
709.209
709.376
Neither of you are good enough
for my sister.
711.837
# HOWARD
712.004
Who are you to decide that?
713.588
# LEONARD
713.755
He's the man of his family.
You have to respect his wishes.
716.466
# SHELDON
716.633
You're out too, by the way.
717.926
# LEONARD
717.926
Say what?
719.219

**LOL**
# SHELDON
719.386
Nothing personal.
I'd prefer my niece or nephew...
721.722
721.888
...didn't become flatulent
every time they ate an Eskimo Pie.
725.517

What are you so happy about?

I'm not happy.

It's the medication. I can't stop smiling.
737.821

**LOL**
# SHELDON
744.995
Now that Leonard's made me aware
of how high the genetic stakes are...
748.248
748.415
...we have to face the fact that none
of you are suitable for my sister.
751.752
# HOWARD

Wait a minute,
Leonard made you aware of that?
755.505

We all make mistakes. Let's move on.

Excuse me, but I think you're missing
a big opportunity here.

762.220
How so?

# RAJ
763.304
Everybody knows genetic diversity...

Why not put a little mocha
in the family latte?

**LOL**
# SHELDON
772.731
In principle, you have a point.
774.316
774.483
But as a practical matter, need I remind you
it takes experimental pharmaceuticals...
778.445
778.612
...to simply enable you
to speak to the opposite sex?
782.199
782.407
I think you're focusing
entirely too much on the drugs.
786.119
790.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
791.458
Is it because I'm Jewish?
792.626
792.793
Because I'd kill my rabbi with a pork chop
to be with your sister.
796.296
795.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
802.844
This has nothing to do with religion.
804.596
804.763
This has to do with the fact
that you're a tiny man...
807.224
807.391
...who still lives with his mother.
809.434
809.400

Here. Eat this cheese without farting,
and you can sleep with my sister.

# MISSY
827.828
Shelly, can I speak to you for a minute?
Alone.
830.664
# SHELDON
831.873
Why does everyone
suddenly wanna talk to me alone?
834.167
834.334
Usually nobody wants
to be alone with me.
837.337
837.200

843.051
We all make mistakes. Let's move on.
845.554

# MISSY
847.222
Okay.
848.640
848.807
I'm not even gonna ask
why you're pimping me out for cheese...
852.394
852.700
**LOL**
853.228
...but since when do you care at all
about who I sleep with?
856.481
# SHELDON
856.648
Truthfully,
I've never given it any thought...
858.817
858.984
...but it has been pointed out to me
that you carry DNA of great potential.
862.529
# MISSY
862.696
What on earth are you talking about?
864.072
# SHELDON
864.072
Let me explain.
865.449
865.615
You see,
I'm a superior genetic mutation...
869.035
869.202
...an improvement
on the existing mediocre stock.
872.038
# MISSY
873.832
And what do you mean,
"mediocre stock"?
876.501
# SHELDON
876.668
That would be you.
877.752
878.500
**LOL**
879.337
But residing within you
is the potential for another me.
882.591
882.757
Perhaps even taller, smarter
and less prone to freckling.
885.969
886.136
A Sheldon 2.0, if you will.
889.639
889.600
**LOL**
# MISSY
890.140
Sheldon 2.0?
891.558
# SHELDON
891.558
Exactly.
892.976
893.143
Now, I am not saying that I should be
the sole decider of who you mate with.
896.897
894.100
**LOL**
897.063
If you're not attracted, then the
likelihood of conception will be reduced.
900.609
# MISSY
900.775
You have got to be kidding me.
902.005
# SHELDON
902.005
Not at all.
903.236
903.403
Frequent coitus dramatically increases
the odds of fertilization.
906.698
906.700
**LOL**
# MISSY
907.866
Okay, Shelly, sit down.
910.785
913.288
Now, I've lived my whole life dealing
with the fact that my twin brother is...
916.917
917.083
...as Mom puts it,
one of God's special little people.
921.046
921.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
921.922
I always thought
I was more like a cuckoo bird.
924.257
924.424
A superior creature whose egg is placed
in the nest of ordinary birds.
928.470
928.637
The newly hatched cuckoo
eats all the food...
930.722
930.889
...leaving the ordinary siblings
to starve to death.
933.934
933.300
**LOL**
934.518
Luckily for you,
that's where the metaphor ended.
937.312

938.939
I thought it ended at cuckoo.
941.149
941.900
**LOL**
943.527
Now, you listen to me.
944.819
944.986
If you wanna start acting like a brother
who cares about me, terrific.
948.240
948.615
Bring it on.
950.075
950.242
But you try one time to tell me
who I should be sleeping with...
953.161
953.328
...and you and I are gonna go round the way
we did when we were little. Remember?
958.124
960.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
961.628
I have an alternate proposal.
962.775
# MISSY
962.775
Go on.
963.922
# SHELDON
964.589
You donate eggs.
We will place them in cryogenic storage.
967.634
967.801
I will find an appropriate sperm donor
for your eggs...
970.720
970.887
...have them fertilized
and implanted in you.
973.390
973.557
That way, everybody wins.
974.849
981.000

# SHELDON

Correction.
Missy can date whoever she wants.

Sheldon's sister is hiding at Penny's
because we've all been hitting on her.

She's not hiding. She needed to call her
grandmother, who's apparently very sick.

she has to wash her hair.
