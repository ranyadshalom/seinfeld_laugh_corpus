To this day she doesn't know
we were going out.
231.065

Before an application is released,
they give it a trial run.
251.169
251.335
We could do that.
252.879
253.045
And if we hit a rough spot,
instead of getting mad, we
256.257
256.424
"Hey, we found a bug"
and report it, so it can be fixed.
260.595

You mean like a beta test?
262.680

**LOL**
# LEONARD
264.015
Technically, this would be an alpha test.
265.975

A beta test requires people that

No, you should. Absolutely.
That was me being pedantic.
276.444

And that's our first bug.

Traditional choice with Peking duck
is a sauvignon blanc...
942.025
942.192
...but Siri suggested an off-dry Riesling.
944.862
945.028
I wasn't sure...
946.155
946.321
...but I didn't wanna have an argument
with her in the middle of Trader Joe's.
