Hmm.
6.132
# SHELDON
6.424
The problem appears to be unsolvable.
8.217
# RAJ
8.384
Maybe we could run
some computer simulations.
10.469
# HOWARD
10.636
There are many variables.
It would take forever.
12.888
# LEONARD
13.055
We've gotta be missing something.
15.266
15.433
Okay. Let's start again.
16.684
16.851
The movie is playing here at 7:20,
here at 7:40...
20.313
20.000
**LOL**
20.479
...here at 8:10, and here at 8:45.
22.732
# SHELDON
23.357
All right.
These theaters have to be eliminated.
25.776
# LEONARD
25.943
Why? They're state of the
27.674
27.674
digital projection, surround sound.
29.405
# SHELDON
29.572
Yes, but they have no lcee machines.
32.241
32.200
**LOL**
33.034
Despite my aggressive
letter-writing campaign, I might add.
36.162
36.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
36.871
What about the multiplex here?
The seats are terrific.
39.749
# SHELDON
39.915
They have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines.
No lumbar support can compensate for that.
44.670
44.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
45.671
It's gonna take an hour to eat and I don't
see a Sheldon-approved restaurant...
49.383
49.550
...proximate
to a Sheldon-approved theater.
51.969
51.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
52.136
We could eat after the movie.
53.388
# SHELDON
53.388
Unacceptable.
54.639
54.805
The delay would result in tomorrow
morning's bowel movement at work.
58.309
59.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
59.560
Hang on, hang on.
There's a 7-Eleven here.
62.647
62.813
We smuggle Slurpees, which are
essentially Icees, in under our coats...
66.400
66.567
...after having a pleasant meal
either here, here or here.
70.988
# HOWARD
71.489
Wow.
72.531
72.698
I don't see how we missed that.
73.738
# SHELDON
73.738
Excuse me?
74.778
74.867
In what universe are Slurpees Icees?
78.454
78.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
79.789
That's how we missed it.
81.749
# LEONARD
82.124
Would you be prepared,
on a non-precedential basis...
84.752
84.919
...to create an emergency
ad hoc Slurpee-lcee equivalency?
87.797
# SHELDON
87.963
Oh, Leonard, you know I can't do that.
91.300
91.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
92.593
Okay, I guess we only have one option.
94.679
# RAJ
94.845
Yup, I don't see any way around it.
96.472
# LEONARD
97.598
Bye, Sheldon.

138.743

# PENNY

Is Leonard around?
153.571
# SHELDON
153.571
He went to the movies without me.

155.156
It was the only option.

165.791
I'm sorry, I don't know understand

Could you give me some guidance
how to proceed?
171.380

# PENNY
172.757
The building manager's showing
an apartment downstairs...
175.009
175.176
...and I haven't paid my rent.
176.865
# SHELDON
176.865
Oh, I see.
178.554
178.888
I'm not comfortable harboring
a fugitive...
180.890
181.056
...from the 2311
North Los Robles Corporation.
183.934
182.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
184.351
It's no big deal.
I'm just a little behind on my bills.
186.896
187.062
They out back my hours
at the restaurant and my car broke down.
189.982
# SHELDON
190.149
If you recall...
191.358
191.525
...l pointed out the "check engine" light
to you several months ago.
195.321
194.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
195.738
No, the "check engine" light is fine.
It's still blinking away.
200.201
200.000
**LOL**
200.534
It's the stupid engine
that stopped working.
203.412
203.300
**LOL**
204.163
It cost me, like, $1200 to fix it.
206.373
# SHELDON
207.416
You know, it occurs to me. You could solve
all your problems by obtaining more money.
212.213
212.700

215.341
Yes, it occurs to me too.

232.274
232.650

Wow, you got a lot of money in there.

249.730
# PENNY

Well, yeah, but
250.668
# SHELDON
250.835
This is money I'm not using.
252.211
# PENNY
252.378
But what if you need it?
253.546
# SHELDON
253.712
My expenses account for 46.9 percent
of my after-tax income.
257.550
257.716
The rest is divvied up
between a small savings account...
260.386
260.553
...this deceptive container
of peanut brittle...
262.763

280.239
# SHELDON
280.406
I see no large upcoming expenditures.

It's impossible to pay me back
sooner than you can.

It must be the beret I ordered.
405.906
406.073
A couple of months ago.
It was back-ordered.
408.826
# SHELDON
409.410
Did you know the beret
is an example...
411.328
411.495
...of a piece of women's fashion
adapted from male military uniforms?
415.082
415.249
Another fascinating example
is the epaulet.

It's not like I'm running up and down
the streets buying berets.
428.929
429.096
I bought one a month ago when it was
back-ordered. It finally arrived.
432.349

I've been having leftovers for four days and

It's actually one

Oh, here's something.

If you don't have electricity,

695.821
Just a suggestion.

No, but he will.

Okay, here it is.
Penny's in kind of a financial jam...

...and the money you owe her would
go a long way to solving her problems.
1029.529
# KURT
1029.696
And she sent you to get it from me?
1031.865
# LEONARD
1031.865
No, she's too proud to ask for the money.
1034.034
1034.200
I, on the other hand,
feel you should honor your debt.

Really?
1184.976
