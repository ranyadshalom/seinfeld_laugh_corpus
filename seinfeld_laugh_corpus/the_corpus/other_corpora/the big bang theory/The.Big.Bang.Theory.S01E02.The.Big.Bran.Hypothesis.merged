Does it have peanut oil?

I'm not sure.

Everyone keep an eye on Howard
in case he starts to swell up.

Any chopsticks?

# SHELDON

Don't need chopsticks, this is Thai food.

Here we go.

# SHELDON
20.104
Thailand has had the fork
since the latter half of the 19th century.
23.232
23.399
They don't put the fork in their mouth,
they use it to put the food on a spoon...
27.153
27.320
...which then goes into their mouth.
29.530
# LEONARD
29.697
Ask him for a napkin, I dare you.

No.
41.542

You're not swelling, Howard.
43.169

No, look at my fingers,
they're like Vienna sausages.

So you're coming home from work.
That's great. How was work?

# PENNY
53.387
You know, it's a Cheesecake Factory...
55.139
55.306
...people order cheesecake
and I bring it to them.

# LEONARD
57.808
So you kind of act
as like a carbohydrate delivery system?

63.773
Yeah, call it whatever you want,
I get minimum wage.
66.317
67.400

67.735
Yeah.
68.736

I was wondering
if you could help me out

Yes.
72.052

# PENNY

Oh.
73.115

Okay, great, I'm having
some furniture delivered...

Still not talking to me, huh?
101.560
# SHELDON
101.727
Don't take it personally,
it's his pathology.
103.771
103.938
He can't talk to women.
105.335
# HOWARD
105.335
He can't talk to attractive women.
106.732

Or in your case,
a cheesecake-scented goddess.
109.402
110.000

# LEONARD
109.860
There's gonna be some furniture delivered?
111.195
# PENNY
111.195
Yeah.
112.530
112.697
If it gets here and I'm not here,
could you sign for it and put it in?
116.283
# LEONARD
116.450
Yeah, no problem.
117.618

Um...
125.876
125.900
**LOL**
126.460
If you don't have any other plans...
128.129
128.295
...do you wanna join us for Thai food
and a Superman movie marathon?
131.465
# PENNY
131.632
A marathon? Wow, how many
Superman movies are there?
134.427
# SHELDON
134.844
You're kidding, right?
137.722
136.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
137.888
I do like the one where
Lois Lane falls from the helicopter...
140.599
140.766
...and Superman catches her.
142.059
142.226
Which one was that?
143.435
143.435
One.
144.645
144.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
145.229
You realize that scene was rife
with scientific inaccuracy?
148.649
# PENNY
148.816
Yes, I know, men can't fly.
150.568
# SHELDON
150.735
No, let's assume that they can.
152.236
152.600
**LOL**
154.071
Lois Lane is falling.
155.322
155.489
Accelerating at an initial rate
of 32 feet per second.
157.950
158.600
**LOL**
158.117
Superman swoops down to save her
by reaching out two arms of steel.
161.162
161.328
Miss Lane, who is now traveling...
163.080
163.247
...at approximately
120 miles an hour, hits them...
165.666
165.833
...and is immediately
sliced into three equal pieces.
168.794
168.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
170.129
Unless Superman
matches her speed and decelerates.
173.507
# SHELDON
173.674
In what space, sir? In what space?
175.384
175.551
She's 2 feet above the ground.
176.969
176.200
**LOL**
177.595
If he really loved her,
he'd let her hit the pavement.
180.181
180.347
It would be a more merciful death.
181.515
# LEONARD
181.515
That doesn't
182.683
182.200
**LOL**
182.850
Excuse me, your entire argument
is predicated on the assumption...
186.604
186.771
...that Superman's flight
is a feat of strength.
189.106
# SHELDON
189.273
Are you listening to yourself?
190.691
190.858
Superman's flight is a feat of strength.
193.027
193.194
An extension of his ability
to leap buildings...
195.446
195.613
...an ability he derives
from exposure to sun
197.740
# HOWARD
197.907
How does he fly at night?
199.784
# SHELDON
199.950
A combination
of the moon's solar reflection...
202.077
202.244
...and the energy storage capacity
of Kryptonian skin cells.
205.289
205.300

# PENNY
206.624
I'm just gonna go wash up.

# LEONARD
208.542
I have 2600 comic books in there.
210.377
210.544
I challenge you to find a single reference
to Kryptonian skin cells.
214.131

214.298
Challenge accepted.

Okay.

Her apartment's on the fourth floor,
elevator is broken, you're gonna

253.003
Oh, you're just gonna be done?
Okay, cool, thanks.
255.548

257.007
I guess we'll just bring it up ourselves.
258.884

I hardly think so.

Why not?
262.888
# SHELDON
263.055
Well, we don't have a dolly...
264.640

...or lifting belts,
or any measurable upper-body strength.

# LEONARD
269.144
We don't need strength.
We're physicists.
271.397
271.564
We are the intellectual
descendents of Archimedes.
273.899
274.066
Give me a fulcrum and a lever
and I can move the Earth.
276.610

It's just a matter-- I don't have this!
I do not have this!

Do you have any ideas?

Yes, but they all involve
a Green Lantern and a power ring.

Easy. Easy.
299.049

Okay. Now we've got an inclined plane.
304.889
302.800
**LOL**
305.055
Force required to lift is reduced
by the sine of the angle of the stairs...
308.517
308.684
...call it 30 degrees, so about half.
310.561

310.728
Exactly half.

Okay.
321.864

# SHELDON
348.307
You do understand
that our efforts here...
350.184
350.351
...will in no way increase the odds of you
having sexual congress with this woman?
354.855
354.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
355.356
Men do things for women
without expecting sex.

358.067
Yeah, those would be men
who just had sex.

# LEONARD
361.737
I'm doing this to be a good neighbor.
363.739

In any case, there's no way
it could lower the odds.

Almost there.

This is chaos.

Excuse me.
401.819

Explain to me a system...
403.278
403.445
...where a tray of flatware
on a couch is valid?
406.615
406.300
**LOL**
406.782
I'm just inferring that this is a couch...
408.742

coffee table's having a tiny garage sale.

Did it occur to you that not everyone

When the transvestite lived here,
you didn't care how he kept the place.

I mean, you open that man's closet...
458.333

You can't break into a woman's apartment

567.067
# SHELDON
567.234
I had no choice.
568.235
568.402
I couldn't sleep knowing that just
outside my bedroom was our living room...
571.905
572.072
...and outside our living room
was that hallway...
574.366
574.533
...and immediately adjacent
to that hallway was this.

...there is no reasonable explanation
as to why we're here?

584.418
I just gave you a reasonable explanation.

No, no. You gave me an explanation.

# LEONARD
605.397
What?

# SHELDON
607.024
Evolution has made women sensitive
to high-pitch noises while they sleep...

610.652
...so that they'll be roused
by a crying baby.

If you want to avoid waking her,
speak in a lower register.

I have to say I slept splendidly.

A well-known folk cure for insomnia...
672.005
672.172
...is to break
into your neighbor's apartment and clean.
674.967

Granted, my methods
may have been somewhat unorthodox...

will be a measurable enhancement...
685.102

You've convinced me, maybe we should
sneak in and shampoo her carpet.

You don't think that crosses a line?

Yes.

For God's sake, Sheldon...

**LOL**
# PENNY
753.754
In my apartment? While I was sleeping?

And snoring.
And that's probably just a sinus infection.
759.426
757.700
**LOL**
759.593
But it could be sleep apnea. You might
wanna see an otorhinolaryngologist.
763.180

765.849
The throat doctor.
767.642

And what kind of doctor
removes shoes from asses?

# SHELDON
772.981
Depending on the depth...
774.149
774.800

I think what you're feeling is valid
and maybe later today...
793.377
793.543
...when you're feeling less,
for lack of a better word, violated...
796.755

Penny, Penny, hold on.
803.303
803.470
Just to clarify...
804.805
804.971
...because there will be a discussion
when you leave.
808.850
808.300
**LOL**
809.017
Is your objection solely to our presence
in the apartment while you were sleeping...
812.979
813.146
...or do you also object to the imposition
of a new organizational paradigm?
817.734

Well, that was a little non-responsive.

and then they cleaned it.

915.400
**LOL**
914.956
Okay? And you don't shoot to wound.
916.750

I mean, all right, my sister shot her husband,
but it was an accident, they were drunk.

What was I saying?
923.798
923.965
She's so chatty.

926.760
Maybe my parents were right. Maybe I'd
be better off with an Indian girl.
930.388

We'd have
the same cultural background...

It's obvious they meant well.

...l broke up with my boyfriend
and it's freaking me out.
942.442

**LOL**
# PENNY
947.155
I mean, just because most of the men
I've known happened to be jerks...
950.575
950.742
...doesn't mean I should just assume
Leonard and Sheldon are.
953.745
953.912
Right?

I should probably nod.

Well, she was upset at first...

1016.516
...but probably
because her sister shot somebody.
1020.020
1019.500

in what was...

1084.084
The hallmark
of the great human experiment...

...is the willingness

It is an inefficient design.
1163.246
1163.413
For example,
Penny has a flatscreen TV...
1165.013
1165.165
...which means all this space
behind it is wasted.
