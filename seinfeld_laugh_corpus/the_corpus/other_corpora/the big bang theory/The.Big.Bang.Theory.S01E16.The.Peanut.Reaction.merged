Nice move.
3.067
3.067
I've got it.
3.713
3.879
Take him down.
4.859
4.859
He's got you, Sheldon.
5.840
6.007
Come on.
7.107
7.107
He's completely schooling you.
8.207
8.342
Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses
wanted me to ask you something.
11.429
# LEONARD
11.596
It's Tressling.
12.868
# HOWARD
12.868
It combines the physical strength...
14.140
14.307
...of arm wrestling with the mental agility
of Tetris into the ultimate sport.
18.686
18.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
18.853
That's terrific, but what they wanted me
to ask you is to cut it the hell out.
22.648
22.500
**LOL**
22.815
All right, come on, guys. Come on.
24.567
24.734
WAIT STAFF :
Happy birthday to you
28.654
# SHELDON
28.946
We might as well stop, it's a stalemate.
30.865
31.032
You're beating me in Tetris, but you've got
the upper body strength of a Keebler elf.
34.994
34.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
35.161
Keebler elf?
I got a Keebler elf right here.
37.455
41.700
**LOL**
42.501
Okay, it's a stalemate.
44.378
# PENNY
45.880
Leonard, will we be seeing you on Saturday
for your free birthday cheesecake?
49.634
# SHELDON
49.800
He can't eat cheesecake.
He's lactose intolerant.
52.178
# PENNY
52.345
Okay, he can have carrot cake.
53.804
# SHELDON
53.971
What about the cream-cheese frosting?
55.410
# PENNY
55.410
He can scrape it off.
56.849
56.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
57.975
Forget about the cake.
How did you know my birthday's Saturday?
61.020
# PENNY
61.187
I did your horoscope, remember?
62.647
62.813
I was gonna do everybody's until Sheldon
went on one of his psychotic rants.
66.317
67.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
67.109
For the record, that psychotic rant...
68.986
69.153
...was a concise summation
of the research of Bertram Forer...
72.031
72.198
...who, in 1948, proved conclusively...
74.575
74.742
...through meticulous experiments...
76.577
76.744
...that astrology
is pseudoscientific hokum.
79.080
# PENNY
79.246
Blah, blah, blah. Typical Taurus.
81.082
81.400
**LOL**
82.541
So we gonna see you Saturday?
83.855
# LEONARD
83.855
I don't think so.
85.169
# PENNY
85.336
Why not?
86.295
# LEONARD
86.295
I don't celebrate my birthday.
87.254
# PENNY
87.421
Shut up. Yeah, you do.
88.589
# LEONARD
88.756
It's no big deal.
It's the way I was raised.
90.925
91.092
My parents focused
on celebrating achievements...
93.552
93.719
...and being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them.
97.473
97.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
97.973
That's so silly.
99.558
# SHELDON
99.558
It's actually based on very sound theories.
101.143
101.310
His mother published a paper on it.
102.770
# PENNY
102.770
Well, what was it called?
104.230
104.397
"I Hate My Son
and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?
106.774
107.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
107.900
It was obviously effective.
109.527
109.694
Leonard grew up to be
an experimental physicist.
111.904
112.071
Perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas,
he'd be a little better at it.
115.783
115.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
116.617
Thank you.
118.452
# HOWARD
118.619
Well, I love birthdays. Waking up
to Mom's special French-toast breakfast...
122.456
122.623
...wearing the birthday king crown,
playing laser tag with all my friends.
126.419
# PENNY
126.585
Yeah, see? That's what kids should have.
128.629
# HOWARD
128.796
Actually, that was last year.
131.173
131.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
134.093
So you've really never had
a birthday party?
137.471
# LEONARD
137.638
No, but it was okay.
139.140
139.306
When I was little, I'd think my parents
would change their mind and surprise me.
143.561
143.728
This one birthday,
I came home from my cello lesson...
146.230
146.397
...and I saw strange cars
parked out front.
148.357
148.524
When I got to the door,
I hear whispering...
150.526
150.693
...and I could smell German chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.
154.113
# PENNY
155.030
And?
156.928
# LEONARD
156.928
It turns out my grandfather had died.
158.826
158.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
159.493
Oh, my God, that's terrible.
161.746
# LEONARD
161.912
Well, it was kind of like a birthday party.
164.123
164.500
**LOL**
164.874
I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...
168.461
168.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
169.253
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
170.775
# HOWARD
170.775
You think?
172.298
172.465
Go ahead,
tell her about your senior prom.
174.508
175.000
**LOL**
201.786
Make sure they remember, no peanuts.
203.704
# LEONARD
203.871
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town
knows you can't eat peanuts.
208.000
207.700
**LOL**
208.501
When they see me coming,
they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy."
211.962
212.100
**LOL**
222.932
Hello, Penny, Leonard just left.
224.704
# PENNY
224.704
I know, I wanna talk to you.
226.477
# SHELDON
226.644
What would we talk about?
228.312
228.562
We have no overlapping
areas of interest I'm aware of.
231.065
231.232
As you know, I don't care for chitchat.
232.858
233.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
232.858
Can you just let me in?
234.485
# SHELDON
234.652
Well, all right, but I don't see this
as a promising endeavor.
237.863
237.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
239.114
Okay, here's the deal.
240.157
240.324
We'll throw Leonard a kickass
surprise party for his birthday.
243.244
# SHELDON
243.410
I hardly think so.
244.411
244.578
Leonard made it clear
he doesn't want a party.
246.831
# HOWARD
246.997
Did someone say party?
249.291
249.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
250.543
He just doesn't know he wants one,
because he's never had one.
253.712
# HOWARD
253.879
I suppose that's possible.
255.089
255.256
But for the record, I've never had a
threesome and yet I still know I want one.
258.926
258.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
261.262
Here's the difference.
262.304
262.471
The possibility exists
Leonard could have a birthday party...
265.266
265.432
...before hell freezes over.
267.560
267.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
269.270
Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.
272.106
273.941
I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.
275.609
276.861
Can you bring a friend?
278.737
278.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
280.447
I think a birthday party
is a terrible idea.
282.825
282.992
I envy Leonard for growing up
without that anguish.
285.744
# PENNY
285.911
Anguish?
286.954
# SHELDON
287.121
Year after year,
I had to endure wearing conical hats...
290.207
290.374
...while being forced into the crowded,
sweaty hell of bouncy castles.
293.711
293.878
Not to mention being blindfolded...
295.504
294.500
**LOL**
295.671
...and spun toward
a grotesque tailless donkey...
297.965
298.132
...as the other children mocked
my disorientation.
301.176
300.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
301.969
Okay, sweetie, I understand you have scars
that no non-professional can heal...
306.265
307.000
**LOL**
306.432
...but nevertheless, we're gonna
throw Leonard a birthday party.
309.310
# SHELDON
309.476
I'm extremely uncomfortable
with dancing...
311.520
311.687
...loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity.
314.940
315.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
316.483
Nevertheless--
317.297
# SHELDON
317.297
In addition
318.110
# PENNY
318.277
You either help me
throw Leonard a birthday party...
320.738
320.905
...or I will go into your bedroom...
322.573
322.740
...and unbag all
your mint-condition comic books.
325.284
325.451
And on one of them-- You won't know which.
327.765
327.765
-I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.
330.080
329.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
331.832
You can't do that. If you make a mark
in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.
335.961
# PENNY
336.128
Do you understand
the concept of blackmail?
338.339
# SHELDON
338.505
Well, of course, I-- Oh.
340.341
340.500
**LOL**
342.593
Yeah, I have an idea. Let's throw Leonard
a kickass birthday party.
345.971
346.400
**LOL**
351.800
**LOL**
359.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
365.699
That's not the secret knock.
367.451
367.300
**LOL**
368.786
This is the secret
371.121
373.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
374.541
What difference does it make?
376.043
# SHELDON
376.210
The point of a secret knock
is to establish a nonverbal signal...
379.213
379.380
...to verify the identity
of one's coconspirators.
382.091
# PENNY
382.257
PENNY: ls that Raj and Howard?
383.925
# SHELDON
383.925
Possibly, but unverified.
385.594
385.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
385.761
Would you just let us in?
387.304
# SHELDON
387.471
Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.
390.557
390.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
390.724
So, what'd you get the birthday boy?
392.393
# HOWARD
392.559
Raj got him an awesome
limited-edition Dark Knight sculpture...
395.521
395.688
...based on Alex Ross'
definitive Batman.
397.564
397.731
And I got him this amazing autographed
copy of The Feynman Lectures on Physics.
401.652
401.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
401.819
Nice. I got him a sweater.
405.197
405.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
405.823
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.
409.535
409.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
410.327
Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
412.017
# SHELDON
412.017
That's because I didn't bring one.
413.706
# PENNY
413.872
Why not?
414.436
# HOWARD
414.436
Don't ask.
414.999
# SHELDON
415.165
The entire institution of gift-giving
makes no sense.
418.210
# HOWARD
418.377
Too late.
419.962
# SHELDON
419.962
Let's say I go out and I spend $50 on you.
421.547
421.714
It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need...
424.842
425.009
...where you know what you need.
426.593
426.760
I could simplify things,
just give you the $50 directly...
429.888
430.055
...and then you could give me $50
on my birthday and so on...
432.891
433.058
...until one of us dies,
leaving the other one old and $50 richer.
437.187
437.100
**LOL**
439.231
And I ask you, is it worth it?
441.483
441.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
442.067
Told you not to ask.
443.944
# PENNY
444.111
Well, Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.
447.781
# SHELDON
447.948
I accept your premise,
I reject your conclusion.
450.409
# HOWARD
452.453
Try telling him
it's a non-optional social convention.
456.123
# PENNY
456.498
What?
457.707
# HOWARD
457.707
Just do it.
458.917
# PENNY
461.128
It's a non-optional social convention.
464.381
# SHELDON
465.466
Ah, fair enough.
467.468
467.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
470.721
He came with a manual.
472.639
472.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
473.432
Question, how am I going to get Leonard
a present before the party?
476.477
476.643
I don't drive and the things available
in walking distance...
479.480
479.646
...are a Thai restaurant
and a gas station.
481.482
481.648
I could wrap up an order of mee krob
and a couple of lottery scratchers.
485.819
485.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
485.986
Okay, let's do this.
I will drive Sheldon to get a present.
489.490
489.656
Howard, get rid of Leonard for two hours.
491.075
# HOWARD
491.075
No problem.
492.493
# PENNY
492.659
And then, Raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.
495.996
496.830
What if guests show up?
498.123
# PENNY
498.123
Entertain them.
499.416
# HOWARD
500.667
What if they're women?
502.544
502.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
503.462
Stare at them
and make them feel uncomfortable.
506.090
511.300
**LOL**
515.974
Hey.
517.330
# LEONARD
517.330
Hey.
518.685
# HOWARD
519.061
How's it going?
520.146
# LEONARD
520.146
Fine.
521.230
520.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
521.939
So listen, the Nuart is showing the
revised, definitive cut of Blade Runner.
527.528
# LEONARD
527.694
Seen it.
528.320
# HOWARD
528.320
No.
528.946
529.113
You've seen
the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.
531.824
532.300
**LOL**
531.990
This one has eight seconds
of previously-unseen footage.
535.285
535.452
They say it completely changes
the tone of the film.
538.122
537.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
538.872
Pass.
540.290
# HOWARD
540.457
Come on. Afterwards, there's a Q&A
with Harrison Ford's body double.
545.003
544.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
545.170
Look, I am in the "Halo" battle
of my life here.
547.548
547.714
There's this kid in Copenhagen,
he has no immune system.
550.300
550.467
So all he does is sit in his bubble
and play "Halo" 24/7.
553.554
553.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
554.221
Can't you play him some other time?
555.973
# LEONARD
556.140
Not if you believe his doctors.
558.809
558.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
562.062
Oh, my God, do you smell gas?
564.439
# LEONARD
565.399
No.
566.400
# HOWARD
566.400
Yeah, no.
567.401
570.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
572.030
You know, they have DVDs over there.
573.824
# SHELDON
573.991
Yes, but they have DVD burners
over here.
577.494
577.661
Leonard needs a DVD burner.
580.581
580.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
580.747
Sheldon, a gift shouldn't be
something someone needs.
583.167
583.333
It should be something fun.
584.585
584.751
Something they wouldn't buy for themself.
587.108
# SHELDON
587.108
You mean, like a sweater?
589.464
589.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
591.425
Well, it's a fun sweater.
It's got a bold geometric print.
595.679
# SHELDON
595.846
Is it the geometry that makes it fun?
597.431
# PENNY
597.431
Okay.
599.016
598.500
**LOL**
599.183
The point is, one of the ways
we show we care about people...
601.977
602.144
...is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.
605.772
# SHELDON
605.939
Okay, I see, so not a DVD burner.
607.962
# PENNY
607.962
Exactly.
609.985
# SHELDON
610.152
Something he wouldn't buy for himself,
something fun, something like-- Ah!
614.114
619.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
620.579
Here you go, Copenhagen boy.
622.372
622.539
How about a taste
of Hans Christian hand grenade?
625.209
625.600
**LOL**
629.463
That could not feel good.
631.048
631.100
**LOL**
633.383
Come on, come on. Oh, you clever...
636.803
640.057
Come on, come on.
642.100
642.559
Take that.
644.228
645.354
Uh-oh.
647.356
650.200

# LEONARD
650.901
What's the matter?
