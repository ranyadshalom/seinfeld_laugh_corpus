Well, there's no point dwelling on it.
5.637

As the Vulcans say...
7.388

**LOL**
11.768
Do you know what that means?
12.977
12.977
No.
14.187
14.437
You telling the truth?
15.772
17.400
**LOL**
18.942
Well, this is ridiculous.
19.984
20.276
Being upset about Amy all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.
23.196
23.446
If I wanna resolve this situation,
then I need to take action.
26.074
26.533
What are you gonna do?
27.534
27.784
I'm going to find her
and ask her to marry me.
29.953
30.119
And if she says yes, we can put this
behind us and resume our relationship.
33.581
33.790
If she says no, well, then she can just...

He didn't mean that.

I think it's so adorable
you're making Sheldon breakfast.
70.076
# LEONARD
70.326
Well, he's having a rough time.
71.828
72.078
Amy broke his heart,
73.162
73.496
the DVR cut off the last minute
of Doctor Who.
76.249
77.041
That crow followed him home.
78.918

**LOL**
# PENNY
80.920
Aren't you worried you're making
French toast on oatmeal day?
83.631
# LEONARD
83.923
Oh? Well, what's this? A pot of oatmeal?
86.467
86.718
Or thanks to you, what I will
now call "gloatmeal"?
90.179
89.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
91.055
Oh, I don't want credit for that.
93.057

# SHELDON
95.101
Dr. and Mrs. Hofstadter,
lovely to see you this fine morning.
97.937
# LEONARD
98.354
You're in a good mood.
99.355
# SHELDON
99.355
I am indeed.
100.356
100.773
I have decided, instead of
wallowing in sadness about Amy,
104.152
104.485
it is time that I find myself
a new female companion.
107.030
# PENNY
107.739
Ah, good for you.
108.803
# LEONARD
108.803
What brought this on?
109.866
# SHELDON
110.283
I realized something.
When Amy was in my life,
112.535
112.869
I was hyper-focused on my work
and ignored her.
115.705
# PENNY
115.997
And you don't want to make the same
mistake with the next woman?
118.517
# SHELDON
118.708
No, I need a new woman
in my life to ignore,
120.627
120.877
so I can hyper-focus on my work again.
122.879
122.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
123.796
Hey, I made French toast sticks.
125.173
# SHELDON
125.548
On oatmeal day?
127.008
# LEONARD
127.008
Ah, I also made oatmeal.
128.468
# SHELDON
128.926
Oh, that's a lot of carbohydrates
for a man on the prowl.
132.263
132.500
**LOL**
132.597
You know what? You eat it, you're married.
134.349
134.557
It doesn't matter what you look like.
136.351
136.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
138.102
Don't take advice from a man
who threw his shoe at a crow.
141.439
169.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
169.425
Thank you for coming by, gentlemen.
170.593
# HOWARD
170.593
No problem.
171.761
# RAJ
171.928
So, what's up?
173.346
# SHELDON
173.554
It was the two of you
who found Amy Farrah Fowler for me.
176.307
176.557
Now that I'm looking
for my next girlfriend,
178.518
178.768
it seemed only logical
that I employ your services once again.
181.771
# HOWARD
182.271
You sure you're up for that?
She did hurt you.
184.649
# SHELDON
184.941
Oh, no, it's all right. I think of my time
with Amy as a stick of Fruit Stripe gum.
189.070
189.362
Sweet and enjoyable at first, but
ultimately a flavorless lump of sadness.
194.117
191.100
**LOL**
194.300

# RAJ
196.244
You're not wrong about Fruit Stripe.
I was always a Hubba Bubba man.
200.123
200.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
201.791
Hubba Bubba over Dubble Bubble?
You're crazy.
204.252

# RAJ
205.086
Hey, the jaw wants what it wants.
206.796
# SHELDON
207.130
Gentlemen!
208.464
208.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
209.132
Oh, right. Uh, girlfriend.
210.800
# HOWARD
211.259
What are you looking for?
212.699
# SHELDON
213.010
All I'm looking for is an educated,
intelligent woman who shares my interests,
217.056
217.265
while retaining
her own unique point of view.
219.142
219.434
She should be kind, patient,
and most important,
222.186
222.520
unable to imagine life without me
by 10 o'clock tonight.
225.815
225.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
226.566
Isn't that a little unreasonable?
228.234
# SHELDON
228.901
Ah, fine. She doesn't need her own
point of view. Now, chop chop.
232.780
231.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
234.532
Come on, Amy! Show us the dress!
236.701
# AMY
237.160
Okay, but I'm really stepping outside
of my comfort zone here.
240.538
244.100
**LOL**
247.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
248.129
Uh...
249.130
249.630
I don't think any of your comfort zones
are showing.
252.175
252.300
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
253.926
It's your third date,
maybe you could go more sexy.
255.928
# AMY
256.304
Well, some people think
the sexiest organ is the brain.
259.265
259.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
260.224
No one ever bought me drinks at a bar
261.601
261.684
because my brain just
popped out of my shirt.
263.686
264.300
**LOL**
# AMY
265.313
Do you have any heels higher than this?
He's pretty tall.
268.065
# PENNY
# BERNADETTE
268.733
Ooh, tall! Finally some details
about this mystery man.
271.861
# PENNY
272.028
Yeah, come on. Tell us more.
273.321
# AMY
273.696
Well, I told you his name and that
he's tall. What more do you need?
276.991
# BERNADETTE
277.492
Did you kiss him yet?
279.097
# AMY
279.097
Just a little peck on the lips.
280.703
282.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
284.624
Well, we're your best friends.
285.875
286.083
Give us one more detail
and we promise we'll leave you alone.
288.483
# AMY
288.711
Fine. Um, he's British.
291.839
293.500
**LOL**
294.675
All right, that is a juicy one!
297.303
296.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
297.804
All right, where's
Tall British Dave taking you?
300.139
# BERNADETTE
300.473
Tea and basketball?
301.724
302.200
**LOL**
# AMY
302.892
To that new Italian place on Walnut.
304.352
# BERNADETTE
304.352
Oh, nice.
305.812
# AMY
306.145
I'm gonna go look for other shoes.
307.185
# PENNY
307.185
Oh, good luck.
308.225
308.397
I threw out all my tall ones
when I married Leonard.
311.025
310.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
313.486
Hey, you wanna swing by that place
tonight and get a look at this guy?
316.247
# PENNY
316.948
We don't even know what time
they're gonna be there.
318.825
# BERNADETTE
318.908
I'll just call the restaurant, pretend
I'm Amy and check the reservation.
321.788
# PENNY
321.911
Damn, you're sneaky.
323.746
# BERNADETTE
324.455
Yeah, but I'm little, so it's adorable.
326.040
327.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
329.627
I think the quickest way
to find you a new girlfriend
331.754
332.046
is just to get you on
every dating website out there.
335.508
# SHELDON
336.050
Are you sure?
I've heard that on those sites,
338.427
338.636
often when you think
you're corresponding with someone,
340.796
340.888
it's actually a computer program
pretending to be a real person.
343.891
# RAJ
344.183
And you're afraid
it'll do a better job than you?
347.019
347.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
348.604
Excuse me, no one does a better job
pretending to be a person than I do.
352.233
353.000
**LOL**
353.776
Siri comes close, but I know more jokes.
356.612
356.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
357.655
Well, if you don't want to use
dating websites, what do you suggest?
360.449
# SHELDON
360.783
Off the top of my head?
361.993
362.285
Prospective women
weed themselves out in a battle of wits
365.246
365.413
until only one champion remains,
367.039
367.415
she shows up at my door
flush with the thrill of victory,
369.917
370.209
and then sits quietly by my side
while I watch Daredevil.
373.462
373.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
375.298
You seriously think women
would fight for you?
377.383
# SHELDON
377.967
People compete for jobs and trophies,
why not me?
380.595
# HOWARD
382.138
He's right. He knows a lot of jokes.
383.806
384.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
386.142
No, but it is basic human nature.
388.853
389.061
If we present him as a prize,
maybe they would.
391.439
# HOWARD
392.189
Well, he's smart,
he's a respected scientist.
394.984
# SHELDON
395.610
And I have the soulful eyes of a cow.
398.696
399.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
400.197

402.012
402.012
I don't know if I'd say you... Oh.
403.826
404.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
406.245
I have an idea. What if we put
a post on Craigslist that says,
409.707
410.082
"World-class Caltech physicist
seeking girlfriend.
412.877
413.210
"If interested, solve the following
puzzles for a chance to meet him."
417.423
# SHELDON
417.798
Oh, we'll make the puzzles
extremely challenging
419.634
419.717
to eliminate unworthy candidates.
421.385
# RAJ
421.761
Oh, we can set it up like a scavenger hunt
423.471
423.638
where the last puzzle gives the winner
Sheldon's contact information.
426.849
# HOWARD
427.391
This is actually
an interesting social experiment.
429.351
# RAJ
429.727
I'm a little jealous of the people
who get to do it.
431.767
# HOWARD
431.854
Me, too, and we've seen the prize!
433.689
433.800

# LEONARD
438.611
I don't understand why we're leaving
so early for the movie?
440.947
# PENNY
441.030
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
we're gonna meet up with Bernadette
443.157
443.240
to spy on Amy and her date.
444.784
445.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
445.117
What? I don't wanna do that.
446.911
# PENNY
447.244
And you think I wanna see a documentary
about aluminum can recycling?
450.539
450.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
451.207
This is the movie that Big Soda
doesn't want you to see.
454.543
455.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
455.544
Yeah, it's the movie
your wife doesn't want you to see.
458.089
458.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
459.715
So, you're actually okay with invading
your friend's privacy?
462.843
# PENNY
463.386
You're not curious who she's outwith?
464.846
# LEONARD
464.846
Not really.
466.305
# PENNY
466.722
But you're curious about aluminum cans.
468.849
469.500

471.268
You're a weird little guy.
472.937

Congratulations.

This is exciting.

# SHELDON
483.447
Right now, somewhere,
484.573
484.740
a woman is dividing the atomic weight
of the best noble gas
487.994
488.160
by the number of colors
in the oldest national flag still in use
491.205
492.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
491.414
Then using that number as
the average speed to calculate
493.499
493.582
the travel time from Mordor to the Shire.
495.752
496.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
495.835
And taking her first step towards
a lifetime of laughter,
498.921
499.088
love and best of all, rules.
501.757
501.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
502.758
I hope we didn't make
the puzzles too hard.
505.136
# HOWARD
505.678
Well, if she can solve them,
it'll prove she's intelligent,
508.723
508.931
tenacious and so socially awkward,
510.975
511.225
she has nothing better to do
on a Saturday night.
513.019
513.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
515.521
Golly, she sounds too good to be true.
517.440
517.500

This is fun.
I haven't dated much since my divorce.

# AMY
523.904
Well, I'm having a good time, too.
525.823

If you don't mind me asking,
why did you and your wife split up?
529.035
# DAVE
529.410
Oh, you know how it is,
we wanted different things.
531.620
531.871
I wanted children, and she wanted
a pastry chef named "Jean-Philippe".
535.541
535.900
**LOL**
# AMY
537.209
Oh, I'm so sorry.
537.939
# DAVE
537.939
It's fine.
538.669
538.961
It's why I left England.
It reminded me too much of her.
542.131
542.631
Cold, gloomy, and easily accessed by
a Frenchman through a tunnel.
546.802
546.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
549.138
Hey. So, where are they?
551.035
# BERNADETTE
551.035
Across the street, in the left window.
552.933
# PENNY
554.351
Oh, damn it,
we should have brought binoculars.
556.191
# BERNADETTE
556.604
Right here.
557.980

**LOL**
# LEONARD
559.273
You just happen to have those in the car?
561.108
# BERNADETTE
561.567
Kind of. Before I met Howie, I liked to
keep close tabs on my boyfriends.
565.029
# LEONARD
565.321
By stalking them?
566.822
# BERNADETTE
567.114
No, stalkers are creepy.
568.616
569.408
I'm just a harmless little girl
with military grade spy equipment.
572.995

Oh, there he is.
575.747

577.124
Yeah.

# LEONARD
578.501
Can I see?
579.627
# PENNY
579.877
What? Now you're interested?
You didn't even want to come.
582.213
# LEONARD
582.463
I know, but you guys make
being a crappy friend look fun.
585.508

Fine.
587.426
# LEONARD
588.928
Yeah, okay, I see him.
590.513
590.846
It looks like they're having a nice time.
I wish I could hear what they're saying.
593.933
# BERNADETTE
594.016
Yeah, I should have brought
my parabolic microphone.

Nothing. Not important.

# DAVE
599.688
So, you've never been married?
600.888
# AMY
601.190
No. To be completely honest, I've only
been in one long-term relationship.
606.153
# DAVE
606.737
What happened with that?
607.842
# AMY
607.842
That's a good question.
608.948
611.800
**LOL**
613.661
After five years, it was just feeling like
more work than it should be.
617.039
# DAVE
617.331
That's too bad.
Was he a neurobiologist like you?
619.583
# AMY
619.834
No, he's a theoretical physicist
at CalTech.
623.045
623.800
**LOL**
# DAVE
625.798
I love teaching math,
but that would be my dream job.
628.300
628.509
What's his focus?
629.844
# AMY
630.094
Um, it used to be string theory,
now it's dark matter.
633.347
633.639
But let's not discuss Sheldon,
let's get back to you.
636.559
# DAVE
637.226
Wait, you're not talking about
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?
640.187
640.500

# AMY
642.231
I'm trying not to.
643.732
645.484
Do you know him?

646.944
No, but I've followed his work for years.
He's a rock star.

650.489
You've got to tell me about him.
What's he like?
653.075
653.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
656.287
He really seems into her.
658.539
659.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
660.291
I took a video.
I forgot how much fun this is.
663.919
664.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
665.671
Okay, we saw them.
Can we go catch the movie?
667.965
# BERNADETTE
669.383
Why'd you bring him?
670.676
# PENNY
670.676
I had to, we're married now.
671.969
# BERNADETTE
673.470
Ah, I hear that.
674.555
675.300

# DAVE
681.270
I'm sorry,
just one more question about Sheldon.
683.150
# AMY
683.397
Sure, why not?
684.440
685.400
**LOL**
# DAVE
685.858
It's more of a four-part question, really.
687.735
689.528
When he wrote his paper on supersingular
prime numbers, how long did it take?
693.282
# AMY
694.283
Um, about an hour and a half.
696.243
# DAVE
696.452
Wow!
697.453
698.500
**LOL**
699.663
I mean... Wow!
And you were there to see it?
702.750
# AMY
703.292
Yes. Yeah, we were on a date.
705.294
707.338
Very much like this one.
708.672
709.100
**LOL**
# DAVE
710.424
I doubt it was like this one.
I mean, he's a genius.
713.302
713.636
And I wasn't even smart enough
714.970
715.304
to figure out why
my wife always smelled of croissants.
718.307
717.700
**LOL**
# AMY
719.183
What was the rest of your question?
720.851
# DAVE
721.143
Do you think you can introduce me to him?
722.374
# AMY
722.374
Really?
723.604
723.979
You want me to introduce you
to my ex-boyfriend?
726.273
# DAVE
726.774
You're right, it's weird.
728.525
728.734
No, wait. Do it.
729.818
730.300
**LOL**
731.487
No, I changed my mind, I'd be too nervous.
734.323
735.241
Oh! I don't know what to do!
736.992
736.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
739.328
Are we gonna be much longer?
I really have to go to the bathroom.
741.888
# BERNADETTE
741.997
Right here!
743.165

**LOL**
# RAJ
748.295
37 minutes left until the deadline.
751.048
# SHELDON
751.382
Someone will show.
753.008
# HOWARD
753.175
And no matter what happens,
this was still a fun experiment.
756.178
# RAJ
756.512
Not as fun as the night
we blew up grapes in the microwave.
759.515
760.000
**LOL**
760.766
We really have led full lives.
762.977
763.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
764.770
Someone will show.
766.188
# RAJ
766.438
Maybe you don't want someone
exactly like you.
768.315
768.524
You know what they say, opposites attract.
770.567
# SHELDON
771.068
By that logic, I should be with someone
short, dull, and needy.
775.030
776.000
**LOL**
775.864
Not to cast dispersions, but I can't shake
a stick around here without hitting that.
780.411
783.100
**LOL**
# DAVE
786.000
You know, I once drove 500 miles
to hear him speak at Stanford.
789.086
790.000
**LOL**
# AMY
791.714
I have a DVD of that lecture.
793.445
# DAVE
793.445
Really? Wasn't it great?
795.175
# AMY
796.051
Not as a Valentine's present, no.
799.054
798.400
**LOL**
# DAVE
799.930
Well, the next time you watch it,
801.390
801.724
I'm the bloke who asked the question
that he said was stupid and obvious.
805.853
805.200
**LOL**
806.145
It was the nicest thing
he said to anyone there.
808.856
808.500
**LOL**
# AMY
809.732
That's, um, terrific. Listen, um,
I'm kind of tired. Can we call it a night?
813.527
# DAVE
814.111
Oh, gosh. Sorry, I just spent the whole
night talking about your ex-boyfriend.
818.115
818.324
I'm such an idiot.
819.534
# AMY
819.534
No, you're not.
820.743
# DAVE
821.160
Well, maybe not an idiot.
822.453
822.745
But certainly not as smart as...
Someone we won't mention.
825.956
826.200
**LOL**
# AMY
826.915
Thank you.
827.916
# DAVE
828.334
That you said you might introduce me to.
I'm free on Thursday.

What? Here, gimme, gimme.
834.631
836.759
Oh, my God, oh, my God.
They're coming right towards us.
839.386
# BERNADETTE
839.595
We gotta get out of here.
840.721
# PENNY
840.721
Wait, what about Leonard?
841.847
# BERNADETTE
842.181
He and his tiny bladder can take the bus.
844.767
844.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
849.730
Oh, no!
850.731

Hi, Ames! What're you doing here?

Aren't you Leonard Hofstadter?
869.541
# LEONARD
869.541
Yeah?
870.834
# DAVE
871.001
I saw you speak at Stanford
with Sheldon Cooper.
873.462
873.796
Amy, can you believe it?
It's Dr. Leonard Hofstadter!
877.216
876.800

No, pinch me!
879.968

It's an absolute pleasure to meet you.
Can I shake your hand?
883.077
# LEONARD
883.764
I don't know if you want to do that,
I was just... Okay, never mind.
886.517

888.018
Amy, I'm never washing this hand again.

Oh, I've been telling women that
for 20 years.

903.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
905.327
45.
906.579
# SHELDON
906.579
45 seconds is plenty of time
907.830
908.038
for a woman to walk through that door
and fall in love with me.
911.291
911.667
And probably half that
if I break out the old cow eyes.
914.420
915.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
915.796
30 seconds.
916.880
# SHELDON
917.339
Uh-oh.
918.340
918.674
What if it's Jennifer Lawrence?
920.342
# HOWARD
920.342
What?
922.010
921.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
922.386
Oh, that last Hunger Games
was not my cup of tea.
924.680
# HOWARD
925.514
You thought she was great in X-Men.
927.391
# SHELDON
927.641
Fine, I won't shut my heart
to the love of Jennifer Lawrence.
930.352
931.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
932.020
Guys, 15 seconds.
934.022
# HOWARD
934.189
Maybe she's waiting to show up
at the last possible moment.
936.525
# SHELDON
936.859
Ugh. Sounds like a drama queen. Oh, no.
It is Jennifer Lawrence.
940.696

Five, four, three, two, one.
949.204
954.460
That's too bad.
955.878
# HOWARD
956.211
Maybe we did make the test too difficult.
958.297
# RAJ
958.589
I don't think it matters.
Look, Sheldon,
960.757
960.966
I believe when the time is right
for you to meet someone,
963.206
963.510
it'll just happen, okay?
964.928
965.179
Not because of a test or a website,
but because
967.222
969.725
We are the dreamers of dreams!
972.144
971.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
978.567
It's an actual girl
and she's really pretty!

Answer it!
982.279

983.113
All right.
984.448

Can I help you?
991.705
# GIRL
992.247
Um, are you the physicist
that placed the ad on Craigslist?

Yes.

# GIRL
996.793
Hi, I'm Vanessa Bennett.
998.170
998.587
Sorry it took a while for me to get here.
I was stuck in this boring symposium
1001.424
1001.507
on atomic spectroscopy
when I came across your ad.
1004.259
1004.468
And it saved my night.
1005.761
1005.844
The puzzles were really fun.
1007.471
1007.763
I've never had to translate Klingon
into ancient Sanskrit before.
1011.975
1012.300

# SHELDON
1014.686
Careful, it's addictive.

**LOL**
# VANESSA
1024.238
Or as they say in Sanskrit,
1025.948
# SHELDON
1031.119
And just like that,
you're a Klingon-Sanskrit junkie.
1033.455
1034.200
**LOL**
# VANESSA
1034.957
Anyway, I just knew
I had to meet the person responsible
1037.334
1037.709
for such a brilliant idea.
1039.169
1039.461
And I don't need to tell you there aren't
a lot of men who love physics,
1042.006
1042.089
archaic languages and flags of the world.
1044.883
# SHELDON
1046.134
lam a bit of a unicorn.

**LOL**
1049.388
Well, you certainly seem
like a special lady,
1051.890
1052.140
uh, but as you know,
you missed the deadline,
1053.934
1054.101
so thanks for playing.

# SHELDON
1065.112
She was late.
1066.822
1067.400
**LOL**
1068.031
And she found atomic spectroscopy boring.
I wouldn't coitus her with your genitals.
