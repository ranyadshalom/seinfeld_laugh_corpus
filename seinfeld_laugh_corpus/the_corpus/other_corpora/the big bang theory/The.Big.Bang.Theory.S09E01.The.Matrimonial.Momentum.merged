# SHELDON
286.250
Your friends.
Well, I think you mean my friends.
288.628
288.836
And why wasn't I invited to this?
290.505
# AMY
290.671
Maybe because the two of us being there
would make them feel awkward.
294.383
# SHELDON
295.301
We make everyone feel awkward.
That's our thing!

329.669
# LEONARD
329.752
You're right. I'm sorry.

We have the rest of our lives to dredge up
stuff from the past and fight about it.
335.341

338.427
So what do you think?
Should we run next door and grab a bite?

it would make everyone feel uncomfortable.

that I don't have to go to the bathroom.

I don't need any more time to think.
We're broken up.

# SHELDON
631.887
...take this man to be your husband?
633.639
633.722
Will someone take me home?
635.224
# RAJ
635.224
Yeah. Come on, I'll give you a ride.
636.725
637.226
...symbolizes your eternal love.
639.186
639.520
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
642.398

We did it!

I'm so glad you guys could watch.

We'll say it was beautiful
in the comments section.

# LEONARD
661.458
Hang on.
662.459
662.626
I believe I'm supposed to carry you
across the threshold.
665.045
# PENNY
665.546
Can you?
666.589
666.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
668.340
Who do you think carries Sheldon to bed
when he falls asleep in front of the TV?
671.635
671.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
672.511
Okay, let's do it.
673.762
677.500
**LOL**
683.772
You gonna make it?
684.586
# LEONARD
684.586
I'm okay.
685.399

**LOL**
# PENNY
688.110
Nicely done.
689.278
# LEONARD
689.737
Thank you.
690.779
690.946
Finally there's a Mrs. Hofstadter
who isn't disappointed in me.
693.782

695.117
Oh, the night is still young.

Everything all right?

Yeah, I guess.
714.678
# LEONARD
715.471
Just tell me.
716.805
# PENNY
718.307
It's just, when we were kissing,
719.600
719.767
I couldn't help
but picture you with that other girl.
721.852
# LEONARD
722.019
Oh, no, no. Come on.
723.896
724.313
I have a friend in you, you said so.
725.981
726.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
727.858
You're right. Just forget it.
730.152
# LEONARD
735.199
Okay, listen.
736.492
737.451
If you're imagining that
it was sexy, it wasn't.
740.746
740.913
We were both drunk,
and she smelled like an ashtray.
743.791
743.958
The boat was moving a lot
so I chipped her tooth.
746.126
747.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
747.836
Did you feel guilty?
749.129
# LEONARD
749.630
No, she had dental insurance.
751.215
751.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
753.676
Did you feel guilty after kissing her?
756.220
# LEONARD
756.804
Yes, I felt guilty as soon as it happened.
I feel guilty every time I see her.
761.100
# PENNY
762.935
What do you mean every time you see her?
764.770
# LEONARD
765.562
What
766.563
766.730
do I mean? Boy, that's a toughy.
768.482
769.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
770.859
You still see her?
771.610
# LEONARD
771.610
Well
772.361
773.153
No, not socially.
But you know, just at work.
775.698
# PENNY
776.115
You work with her?
777.741
778.117
How could you not tell me that?
779.389
# LEONARD
779.389
I wanted to tell you in the car,
780.661
780.744
but you told me to stop talking!
782.475
# PENNY
782.475
Okay, so you're saying this is my fault?
784.206
# LEONARD
784.373
No, of course not. Okay, look.
786.875
787.543
Instead of fighting, why don't we
dim the lights, get naked and make a baby?
793.590
797.400
**LOL**
801.849
I was trying to lighten the mood.
803.726
804.560
It's not easy, you try it.
806.228
806.400
**LOL**
809.106
Hello, Mother.
810.566
# MRSCOOPER
810.566
Shelly, how's my baby doing?
812.026
# SHELDON
812.526
I just wanted to let you know you can
remove Amy from your nightly prayers.
816.739
817.114
Unless you're open to praying for
a beehive to fall on her head.
819.908
820.600
**LOL**
# MRSCOOPER
821.035
Oh, what's going on?
822.870
# SHELDON
823.329
She broke up with me.
824.621
# MRSCOOPER
824.621
Oh, Shelly.
825.914
# SHELDON
826.123
I'll be okay, but I think that I'd like
to send the ring back to you.
830.544
# MRSCOOPER
830.919
Well, let's not be hasty.
Are you sure it's over for good?
833.964
# SHELDON
834.214
It's over for me. I'm done with women.
836.592
836.925
Like when I swore off Pop Rocks.
They both hurt you on purpose.
840.054
841.200
**LOL**
# MRSCOOPER
841.805
You wanna tell me what happened?
843.891
# SHELDON
844.266
Are you going to say
it's all part of God's plan?
846.185
# MRSCOOPER
846.268
Good chance.
847.102
# SHELDON
847.102
Then no thank you.
847.936
849.000
**LOL**
# MRSCOOPER
849.480
Well, honey, don't send it back yet.
851.315
851.482
Your sister's married, and I'm not letting
your brother give my grandmother's ring
854.610
854.693
to that whore he's dating.
856.111
856.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
858.572
Wasn't Mary Magdalene
a woman of ill repute?
860.741
# MRSCOOPER
860.991
When your idiot brother redeems mankind
863.285
863.702
he can date whoever he wants.
865.579

Any man would be lucky to have you.

That's true.
881.553
# AMY
882.179
I just hope I did the right thing.
883.806
# STUART
884.098
I'm sure you did.
885.349
885.808
Maybe that's the problem.
You always do the right thing.
888.227
888.936
Maybe it's time to do the wrong thing?
891.146

Exactly.

**LOL**
# LEONARD
910.416
I asked you over and over
if you were okay.
912.334
912.501
Why would you go through with
the wedding if you weren't?
914.628
# PENNY
914.711
I thought I was okay,
but it turns out I'm not!
917.172
# LEONARD
917.923
Okay, listen.
I may not have been entirely faithful,
920.384
920.551
but you, you are not easy to lift.
922.428
923.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
927.349
Wow!
928.350
928.684
Well, marriage must agree with you.
You are just glowing.
932.813
936.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
937.693
I'm not glowing, I'm upset.
939.945

Well, whatever it is, it agrees with you.

Knock, knock, knock, Penny.

# PENNY
961.425
What's this?
962.426
# SHELDON
962.593
Leonard told me what happened.
963.927
964.094
So I took it upon myself
to make you a hot beverage.
966.597
# PENNY
966.889
Oh, that's so sweet of you.
968.015
# SHELDON
968.015
Yeah, I know.
969.141
970.100
**LOL**
971.268
But turns out being sweet isn't enough
to keep a girl these days.
974.938
975.230
I blame Madonna.
976.356
977.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
978.108
I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.
979.693
# SHELDON
980.277
I'm sorry about Leonard.
981.695
981.862
I thought I raised him better than that.
983.462
983.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
984.948
You know, it's bad enough what happened,
986.617
986.783
but then he tried to hide the fact that
988.327
988.600
**LOL**
988.410
he sees her all the time
at the university.
990.746
# SHELDON
991.205
He does? Who is it?
992.831
# PENNY
993.081
Ugh. Some girl named Mandy.
995.125
# SHELDON
996.543
Mandy Chow?
997.398
# PENNY
997.398
Yeah.
998.253
# SHELDON
998.754
Oh, you don't need to worry about her.
1000.274
1000.422
She's brilliant and attractive.
She can do way better than Leonard.
1003.133
1004.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
1009.431
That's great.
1010.724
# SHELDON
1011.600
Wait a minute,
I know this may sound far-fetched,
1014.645
1014.811
but I'm on the market now.
1016.605
1016.855
You know, if I dated Mandy, that would
teach both Leonard and Amy a lesson.
1020.984
# PENNY
1021.777
That's ridiculous.
1023.028
# SHELDON
1023.237
Oh, you're right.
I could never be with a woman
1025.197
1025.364
whose self-esteem was so low
she'd be with Leonard.
1027.616
1027.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
1029.701
I'm with Leonard.
1030.702
# SHELDON
1031.078
Yeah, I know. Forever.
1032.412
1033.200
**LOL**
1035.499
Who would have believed
these things would happen to us?
1038.085
# PENNY
1038.293
Right?
1039.461
1040.420
You know, I can't believe
Amy actually went through with it.
1042.780
# SHELDON
1044.216
Hang on.
1045.300
1045.801
You knew that she was
going to end it with me?
1047.678
1048.136
Did you try and stop her?
1049.471
# PENNY
1050.347
Well, I told her to be true to herself
and do what makes her happy.
1053.475
# SHELDON
1053.684
Do what makes her happy?
1055.060
1055.477
She plays the harp and her car is
paid for. How much happier can she be?
1058.814
1059.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
1060.983
Okay. Look, it's not my fault that
she thought you were a bad boyfriend.
1064.570
# SHELDON
1066.989
I see.
1068.115
1068.282
Well...
1069.283
1074.913
I think I'll be going.
1076.206

# PENNY

Sheldon.
1078.166

1078.166
No, no, no. We are done here.
1079.167
1082.700
**LOL**
1084.631
Would you mind opening the door and
then angrily slamming it behind me?
1088.594
1089.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
1091.388
Sure.
1092.014
# SHELDON
1092.014
Thank you.
1092.639
1094.349
And slam it hard
because I am pretty steamed.
1096.393
1097.300

1100.022
All right, Leonard, hang in there.
Talk to you tomorrow.

I don't know, it's a mess.
They had a huge fight in Vegas.

Sure, let's make it an even hundred.
1136.058
1136.900

1137.851
You would never kiss me and make me
say I love you and then break up with me.
1141.355

1141.938
I wouldn't.
1143.065
1143.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1145.692
Yeah, and you know why?
Because you're a man.

I'm the one that screwed up on this one.

Yeah, well, and you admit it, like a man.
1159.331
1160.300

All you hear women say is,
"I'll just have a salad," you know.

1165.045
"Where's my lip gloss?"

You know what?
She was kind of an honorary man.
1178.600

She had a penis made of science.
