All right, Raj has played
his Phantom Warlord card...
7.967
8.134
...and I am going to back him up
with my Strangling Vines.
12.972
13.973
Choke on that, sucker.

# LEONARD
16.726
Okay. Well, then I'll just cut your vines
with my Ruby Sword.
21.480
21.647
That's right, I did it. I cut them.

Um...
27.403
28.571
I have a question.
30.239
30.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
31.198
Warlord beats troll, troll beats elf,
elf beats water sprite...
34.660
34.827
...and basically everything beats
Enchanted Bunny.
38.789
37.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
38.998
Unless you have the Carrot of Power.
40.875
# PENNY
41.792
Okay, I've got another question.
44.003
44.170
When does this get fun?
46.047
46.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
46.964
Are we gonna talk or are we gonna play
Mystic Warlords of Ka-ah?
50.968
50.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
51.135
Just play a potion card.
53.262
# PENNY
53.429
Which one?
54.680
# SHELDON
54.847
It doesn't matter,
you can't possibly win.
57.892
57.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
58.100
Don't ruin the game.
59.289
# PENNY
59.289
How could he ruin the game?
60.478
# SHELDON
60.645
Given the cards already played, Penny can
only be holding Necromancer Potions...
64.482
64.649
...which are only effective against
wraiths and daywalkers...
67.568
67.735
...and there are no more left.
The cards remaining in the stack
71.030
71.197
Four fire weapons, a troll,
two ogres and the Jewel of Osiris.
74.700
73.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD

See? Ruined.

Sheldon, that is incredible.
79.872
# SHELDON
80.247
From your vantage point,
it certainly must seem so.
83.084
82.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
83.751
Sheldon has kind of
a photographic memory.
86.295
# SHELDON
86.462
"Photographic" is a misnomer.
88.130
88.297
I have an eidetic memory,
as I've told you many times.
91.092
91.258
Most recently last year during lunch
on the afternoon of May 7th.
95.221

107.191
Okay, I gotta go.
108.067
# LEONARD
108.067
Why?
108.943
# PENNY
109.110
Because last time I didn't go,
I ended up playing Mystic Warlords of Ka.
113.531

Not "Ka." Ka-ah.

What?
131.194
# HOWARD
131.194
You and I made a pact...
132.216
132.383
...that if either of us
ever got a hot girlfriend...
134.885
135.052
...that person
would have his girlfriend...
137.096
137.263
...hook the other guy up
with one of her girlfriends.
139.807
# LEONARD
140.015
Yeah, I don't remember that.
140.953
# SHELDON
140.953
Wha--?
141.892
142.059
June 30th, 2004.
144.270
144.000
**LOL**
144.854
Opening day of Spider-Man 2
at the AMC Pasadena.
147.606
147.773
They only had red ICEES, no blue.
151.485
150.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
151.694
Oh, yeah.
152.737
# HOWARD
152.903
Yeah, you've been with Penny
for like a month and a half.
155.614
155.781
Where's my shorty, Morty?
157.992
157.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
158.159
Howard, you can't hold me to that.
160.619
# HOWARD
160.786
Why not?
161.725
# LEONARD
161.725
When I made that agreement...
162.663
162.830
...l didn't think I'd ever have a girlfriend,
and I was positive you never would.
167.126
166.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
167.793
How come I wasn't part of this deal?
169.629
# SHELDON
169.629
You had left the refreshment stand...
171.464
171.630
...in order to indulge in your customary
preemptive pre-show urination.
176.051
175.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
176.469
So that's how it works? I have a teeny
bladder and I don't get a hot girlfriend?
181.015

181.182

I'm sorry, no.

# LEONARD
218.677
But you have a whole bunch of them.
220.471

220.638
Yes, I've moved
to a four-napkin system.
224.016
223.900

224.183
Lap, hands, face
and personal emergency.
227.645

**LOL**
228.854
If you like, starting tomorrow
I'll add a guest napkin...
231.982
232.149
...but I'm afraid
there's nothing I can do for you today.
235.444
235.100

Good luck. That's the face napkin.

# HOWARD

No, I haven't.

246.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
246.247
Why not?
247.269
# LEONARD
247.269
Because I've been busy.
248.290
248.457
Because I haven't figured out a way
to bring it up.
250.918
251.085
And mostly,
and I can't stress how key this is...
253.420
253.587
...because I don't want to.
255.881
255.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
256.048
A pact is a pact.
You have to get Penny to fix me up.
258.884
# LEONARD
259.051
It's not that simple.
What am I supposed to say?
261.345
261.512
"Penny, you have any friends
you'd like to never hear from again?"
264.890
264.100
**LOL**

Come on. I'm smart, I have a good job.
And I have only 3 percent body fat.

I'd imagine you heard
any number of things today.
293.836
294.200
**LOL**
294.003
When you arrived at work,
you undoubtedly
296.297
296.463
"Hello. How are you, Raj?"
297.715
297.900
**LOL**
297.882
You're wearing a new sweater vest,
you may have
300.467
300.634
"New sweater vest?" And possibly,
though less likely, "Nice sweater vest."
304.430
303.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
305.180
Why don't I just tell you
what I heard today?

Okay, I don't know
where you're going with this...

417.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
418.502
No, no, nothing like that.
421.005

No, the deal was that
if either of us ever got a girlfriend...
424.508
424.675
...we'd have her fix the other one up
with one of her friends.
427.678
# PENNY
427.845
You thought a good time to bring this up
would be right after sex?

Well, I sure as hell wasn't gonna
bring it up before sex.
436.020
