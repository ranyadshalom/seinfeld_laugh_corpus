Hey, you guys ready to order?

# SHELDON
5.506
Since we come in
every Tuesday night at 6:08...
8.342
8.509
...and order the same exact thing,
and it's now 6:08...
11.929
12.096
...l believe your question
not only answers itself...
14.599
14.765
...but also stands alongside
such other nonsensical queries as:
18.185
18.352
"Who let the dogs out?"
19.687
19.854
And, uh, "How are they hanging?"
22.690
22.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
23.983
Okay, so the usual with extra spit
on Sheldon's hamburger.
27.653
28.200
**LOL**
# AMY
28.654
Penny, a moment.
Do you have plans this weekend?
31.907
# PENNY
32.074
Oh, gee, Amy, sorry,
I'm pretty busy this weekend.
34.452
# SHELDON
34.619
Probably serving food
that was ordered today.
37.038
37.200
**LOL**
# AMY
38.289
Too bad.
I was hoping you could be my plus one...
40.374
40.541
...at the Institute
of Interdisciplinary Studies symposium...
42.941
43.085
...on the impact of scientific research
on societal interactions.
46.088
# PENNY
47.840
The what?
48.924
49.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
50.301
It's an annual science conference.
51.969
52.136
We've all been invited to speak.
53.346
# PENNY
53.346
Oh, okay.
54.555
54.722
Well, you know, like I said,
I have plans.
56.807
# AMY
56.974
Shame. Since you're my best friend,
it would be a bonding opportunity.
60.645
60.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
62.021
I'm your best friend?
63.397
# AMY
63.564
Don't you read my blog?
65.107
65.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
66.025
Oh, don't feel bad. I never read Leonard's,
and I used to sleep with him.
69.362
69.800
**LOL**
# AMY
72.990
Know anybody who would appreciate
an all-expense-paid spa weekend...
76.118
76.285
...at a resort in Big Sur?
77.662
# PENNY
77.828
No, I-- I'm sorry, free what?
Sorry, what--? What?
80.539
79.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
80.706
I think her weekend just opened up.
82.667
83.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
83.209
Wait, wait. Just to be clear,
when you guys say spa...
85.795
85.961
...does that mean the same thing
as when regular people say it?
89.006
88.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
89.173
Pretty much, except we keep
our shirts on in the sauna.
93.052
93.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
93.219
You know, it is going to be difficult,
but I'm gonna cancel my plans...
96.889
97.056
...so I can do this for my bestie.
98.661
# AMY
98.661
Please don't touch my breasts.
100.267
100.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
101.602
I wasn't going to.
103.020
# AMY
103.187
All right.
I just want to establish boundaries.
105.731
105.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
106.065
This is great.
I haven't had a vacation in ages.
108.484
# SHELDON
108.651
In order to take a vacation,
one first has to work.
111.737
111.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
112.488
For a smart guy, you seem to have
a hard time grasping the
115.825
115.991
"Don't piss off the people
who handle the things you eat."
119.328
118.800
**LOL**
# AMY
120.287
That does seem to be a valid principle.
122.331
122.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
122.998
I trust Penny will adhere to the
Official California Restaurant Workers'...
126.419
126.585
...Solemn Oath of Ethics
and Cleanliness.
128.754
# AMY
129.338
I don't believe there's any such thing.
131.924
# SHELDON
132.800
You lied to me?
134.802

**LOL**
# SHELDON
160.411
Good morning. If I could have
everyone's attention, please.
163.622
163.831
I know we're all eager
to get on the road to Big Sur...
166.625
166.834
...so if we focus, we can get through
this orientation in under a half an hour.
170.838
171.600
**LOL**
172.214
Then it's just Q&A, quiz, safety drills...
174.467
174.633
...pose for commemorative group photo,
and we're off.
177.636
177.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
179.013
Don't worry, just sit next to me during
the quiz and you can copy my answers.

# SHELDON
183.142
Raj, what are you doing?
184.977
186.061
I don't think so.
187.480
188.189
You've had your allotted 6 ounces.
190.441
190.600
**LOL**
190.608
The first bathroom break isn't until
the Denny's located near Bakersfield...
196.030
194.900
**LOL**
196.447
...which is approximately
two and a half hours away.
199.116
199.283
Remember, people, we're only as strong
as our weakest bladder.
203.120

Nobody cares about
your Kegel exercises.

# SHELDON
208.918
All right,
we have seven people and two cars.
212.797
212.963
In the lead car, driven by Leonard...
215.800
215.966
...will be myself...
219.220
217.000
**LOL**
219.386

in the middle of nowhere...
234.985
235.152
...your Nebraska backwoods skills
and brawny hands...
237.863
238.030
...will give us the best chance
to survive in the wild.
241.033

Brawny?

# SHELDON
263.096
It's 11:15.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
269.937
Copy that, Red Five.
272.022

Radio contact is sufficient.
No need to extend your middle finger.
276.318
277.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
279.071
So, Amy, I've been wondering,
are you and Sheldon...
281.448
281.615
...gonna be sharing a room?
283.492
# AMY
283.951
No, we discussed it.
285.244
285.452
We didn't wanna jeopardize
our relationship...
287.621
287.788
...by getting to know each other
too well.
290.165
290.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
290.708
Indeed. Nothing sours a friendship more
than over-familiarity...
294.044
294.211
...with someone's toilet routine.

Don't worry, Penny. You're my plus one.
You'll bunk with me.

straight to the room and take a nap.

to you and me...

Well, honey, if you're that tired, why
don't you just take a nap here in the car?

357.524
Hang on. It's Leonard. Hi, Leonard.
360.027
360.194
LEONARD : Yeah, hi.
Listen, I just got a text from Raj.
363.114

We were all exhausted
and he was threatening to filibuster.
420.337

It's not technically road trip god.
It's travel supervisor.

Although "road trip god"
does have a certain ring to it.

**LOL**
# PENNY
428.137
I don't understand why you people
let him bully you like this.
431.140

Someone should stand up to him.
What's he gonna do?
434.351

436.478
I can't believe you let him

603.562
...if you had sex with that guy,
I mean, there's nothing I can do here...

Sorry, I never figured that a guy like me
going outwith a girl like you...

No. No.
I'm saying exactly the opposite.
