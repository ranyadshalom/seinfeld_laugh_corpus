Could be anything.

Last time he was like this,
he figured out
11.935
12.018
electron transport in graphene.
13.811
13.978
The time before that,
he was making a list of who's allowed

for synthesizing a new stable

Of course. I'd be happy

is to hoist me on your shoulders

and carry me around the cafeteria,
please refrain.

I don't care for heights,
motion sickness

306.270
at the Hubei Institute
for Nuclear Physics
308.022

were extremely promising.

since the Communist party.

You have one arrow in your quiver,

367.000
**LOL**
367.790
Fortunately, another pathway
to a man's heart

is through his stomach.
373.296

**LOL**
# PENNY
373.462
I don't know if I want to cook
for him; he's kind of a picky eater.
375.882
375.965
I mean, "It's too salty.
It's too dry.
378.593
378.759
It's too burnt and frozen
at the same time."

Wait, come on, what else

Well, I've always had this fantasy
that involves dancing.
388.895
389.061
The sexual chemistry between
my partner and me is electric.
393.858
394.025
But boy, oh, boy,
does my father not approve
396.319
396.485
until he sees us
in the big dance competition.
399.280

Okay, that's just the plot
for Dirty Dancing.

Oh, oh. You could
stand outside his window

with a boom box in the air.

Look, Penny,
424.889
425.056
if you truly want to be romantic,
it needs to come from you.

# PENNY
428.351
I get that, but why is this so hard?
430.394
# RAJ
430.561
Well, you've probably never had
to do this stuff 'cause you're young
433.147
433.230
and beautiful and men have
always thrown themselves at you.
435.550

I don't think the Smithsonian's

Ooh! Guess who's getting an article
465.805

written about him in Physics Today?
467.473
467.640
I'll give you a hint.

You measured the diameter
of his suspicious mole yesterday.

Well, you should be. My discovery
is spreading like wildfire.

Unlike my mole, which is holding
steady at the size of a navy bean.

What's next?

This is the very copy
487.743
487.910
of The Handbook

And what?
496.398

# AMY

What are you talking about?
506.508
# SHELDON
506.595
This table,
it's in square centimeters.
509.557
509.724
I read it as square meters.
511.267
511.434
You know what that means?
512.643
# AMY
512.810
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?
515.062

**LOL**
# SHELDON
517.773
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.
520.693
# AMY
521.569
But the Chinese team
found the element.
523.404
# SHELDON
523.571
They shouldn't have.
My calculations were wrong.
526.407
526.574
There must be some resonance between
the elements I didn't know about.
529.335
# AMY
529.452
So YOU just got lucky?

You and me both, brother.
537.710
537.900
**LOL**
539.462
It doesn't matter.
The element was found because of you,
541.662
541.797
and that's groundbreaking.
543.049
# SHELDON
543.215
What matters is
the greatest scientific achievement
545.760
545.926
of my life is based on a blunder.
548.054
548.220
I'm not a genius, I'm a fraud.
550.681
# AMY
552.183
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,
553.476
553.559
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain
555.811
555.978
that we thought was someplace else.
557.146

but it was a happy mistake.
573.037
# SHELDON
573.204

every science classroom, every

590.679
590.846
This mistake
will be staring back at me

Like that time you let Koothrappali
wax your eyebrows.

and you're right,
you don't deserve any credit.

All you did was misread
some numbers on a table.
