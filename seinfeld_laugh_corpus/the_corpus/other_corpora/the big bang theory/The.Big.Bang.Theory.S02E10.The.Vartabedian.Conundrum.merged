I don't see anything at all, Sheldon.

Ugh.
8.259
8.968
You're the doctor, but I'm constantly
hearing this annoying sound.
12.388
# LEONARD
13.556
Me too.
15.266
15.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
16.350
Is it a high-frequency whistle?
17.893
# LEONARD
18.060
No, it's more of a relentless,
narcissistic drone.
22.565
22.100
**LOL**
# STEPH
23.274
Yeah, there's no inflammation at all,
Sheldon.
25.526
# SHELDON
25.693
Then it must be a tumor.
27.945
27.500
**LOL**
# STEPH
29.238
I seriously doubt it.
30.865
# LEONARD
31.032
Maybe it's a lingering bacterial infection
from all those childhood toilet swirlies.
35.578
36.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
37.079
Is that possible?
I used to get those all the time.
40.458
40.625
Even in church.
42.877
42.500
**LOL**
# STEPH
43.252
Well, you know, if it is from a swirly,
there's something I can do, okay. Ahem.
47.923
48.090
Circle, circle, dot, dot,
now you have a cootie shot.
52.845
52.200
**LOL**
54.722
I'm going to bed.
55.264
# LEONARD
55.264
Okay.
55.806
55.973
I'll be right in.
57.120
57.120
Okay.
58.267
# SHELDON
58.559
It's not enough she mocks me...
60.061
60.227
...but that isn't even the correct
procedure for a cootie shot.
63.439
63.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
63.856
Do you understand that Stephanie's
not here to treat your imaginary ailments?
68.277
# SHELDON
68.444
How is it imaginary that
I keep hearing an octave above middle C?
71.572
74.116
Is that imaginary?
75.159
76.200
**LOL**
76.786
I don't think so.
78.746

# LEONARD
82.541
Good night.
83.584
83.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
83.584
Leonard, there's one more thing.
84.627
84.794
Article One, Section Three
of our roommate agreement.
87.254
87.421
I'm calling an emergency meeting.
88.631
# LEONARD
88.631
No, you're not.
89.840
# SHELDON
90.007
Leonard moves the meeting not occur.
Second? None heard, the motion fails.
93.636
93.800
**LOL**
94.929
I'd like to begin the meeting
by congratulating you on the progress...
98.140
98.307
...in your relationship with Dr. Stephanie.
100.309
# LEONARD
101.060
Thank you.
101.852
# SHELDON
101.852
And that being said...
102.645
102.812
...we have to discuss the implementation
of the cohabitation rider...
106.232
106.399
...which has been activated
now that you're living together.
109.151
# LEONARD
109.318
We're not living together.
111.112
# SHELDON
111.112
I beg to disagree. Ahem.
112.905
113.072
"A girlfriend shall be deemed, quote,
living with, unquote, Leonard...
116.325
116.492
...when she has stayed over,
A, 10 consecutive nights...
119.078
119.245
...or B, more than nine nights
in a three-week period, or C...
122.164
122.331
...all the weekends of a given month
plus three weeknights."
125.751
125.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
128.629
That's absurd.
129.630
# SHELDON
129.630
No.
130.631
130.798
You initialed it. See? "L.H., L.H., L.H."
134.009
133.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
134.176
Okay, wait. I only initialed it
because I never thought it would happen.
137.888
138.600
**LOL**
139.181
I initialed another clause naming you
my sidekick in case I get superpowers.
144.186
143.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
144.895
Hm. Yes, you did.
146.856
147.000
**LOL**
148.149
Now to review, the following provisions
are hereby activated.
150.943
151.110
In the refrigerator, as opposed to two
separate shelves and one communal shelf...
154.947
155.114
...the three of us now get individual
shelves and the door becomes communal.
158.743
159.300
**LOL**
158.909
Next, apartment vacuuming shall be
increased from two to three times a week...
162.538
162.705
...to accommodate the increased
accumulation of dead skin cells.
165.666
166.100
**LOL**
165.833
The bathroom schedule.
I'm given to understand...
168.169
168.335
...women have different needs,
so we'll have to discuss that.
172.131
171.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
174.675
I'm going to bed.
175.947
176.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
175.947
But, yeah, but
177.219
177.386
At least take this with you.
178.679
178.846
Look, and have Stephanie
initial here, here, here, here...
182.975
181.700
**LOL**
183.350
...and here.
186.228
186.400
**LOL**
186.395
This states that she does not now...
188.063
188.230
...nor does she intend to play a percussive
or brass instrument.

191.300

202.400

Sure sounds like a tumor...
209.043
209.210
...pressing on the auditory nerve.
211.420
# LEONARD
235.778
No, absolutely not.
237.550
# SHELDON
237.550
It's not a big deal.
239.323
239.490
We have latex gloves.
242.034
241.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
242.201
I don't care what the symptoms are.
243.828
243.994
My girlfriend is not gonna give you
a prostate exam.

Hi, Sheldon.
250.647
# SHELDON
250.647
Good morning, Dr. Stephanie.
252.127
252.294
I trust Leonard satisfied you
sexually last night?
254.588
# LEONARD
254.755
Oh, good God.
257.049
255.800
**LOL**
257.842
Sheldon, we don't ask questions like that.
260.135
# SHELDON
260.302
I heard you ask it over and over.
263.597
263.200
**LOL**
263.764
How is it inappropriate for me
to ask it once?
266.433
# STEPH
266.892
He did very nicely.
268.435
# SHELDON
268.435
But see? She's not offended.
269.979
270.145
And now you finally have an answer.
271.939
272.400
**LOL**
273.774
Out of coffee. Need coffee.

# STEPH
280.155
Mm-hm. And--? And you are?
282.491
# PENNY
282.658
I'm Penny. I live across the hall.
284.618
283.300
**LOL**
285.661
Heard a lot about you.
286.787

# STEPH
289.644
I haven't heard a thing about you.
291.208
294.600
**LOL**
298.966
Leonard? Why haven't I heard a thing about
this woman who lives across the hall...
303.721
303.888
...and comes into your apartment
in the morning in her underwear?
308.517
308.700
**LOL**
312.897
Um. Uh
314.481
# LEONARD
314.648
She's heard about you
because we're, you know, involved...
318.277
318.444
...and you haven't heard about her
because...
322.114
322.948
I never slept with her, I swear.
324.909
325.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
325.868
In Leonard's defense,
it wasn't for lack of trying.

...Penny is one of our many neighbors,
you know.
340.299
340.800
**LOL**
340.466
And in our building,
neighbors come and go.
343.135
343.302
Well, it's very casual. No dress code or...
345.888
346.300
**LOL**
346.472
Some mornings, I'll mosey down
to the third floor in my pajamas...
349.516
349.683
...and have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
352.186
352.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
352.353
Really? I've never once been invited
to have cereal with Mrs. Vartabedian.
356.774
# LEONARD
356.941
She doesn't like you.
358.400
358.600
**LOL**
359.401
Well, you have a gall bladder to remove.
360.611
360.611
Yeah.
361.820
361.987
And I have to get in the shower
and Penny has clothes to put on, so...
365.449
366.000
**LOL**
# STEPH
366.784
Well, it was very nice meeting you.
368.473
# PENNY

# PENNY
386.929
So that's Stephanie, huh?
389.932

You know, she seems very nice.
402.278
# SHELDON
402.278
Oh, she is. She's terrific.
403.946
404.113
And she's proving to be
a valuable roommate.
406.323
# PENNY
406.782
Roommate? You guys are living together?
408.805

Like hippies.

We're not living together.
417.126

418.752
How could I not be sure?
420.212
# PENNY
420.379
Well, let's find out.
422.673
# LEONARD
422.840
Don't you think if a woman was living
with me, I'd be the first one to know?
426.427
# PENNY
426.593
Oh, sweetie, you'd be the last one
to know about it.
429.888
431.300

433.017
Hmm.
434.351

Actually, I think
it's more of a wool-fire ant blend.

The girlfriend's buying clothes
for you, huh? Sounds serious.

It is, actually.
In fact, I gave it a lot of thought...
528.654

...and I decided it was time
for us to live together.

# HOWARD
533.575
Oh, Leonard, huge mistake.
535.828

There's a whole buffet of women out there
and you're just standing in the corner...
539.873
538.300

...eating the same deviled egg,
over and over again.

130/80. That's a little high.

We can attribute that to the stress

Where did you get the stethoscope
and pressure cuff?

605.856
My Aunt Marion gave them to me
for my 12th birthday.
608.609
609.200

She thought if I failed at theoretical physics
that I should have a trade to fall back on.
614.489
614.200

And by the way, the blood pressure cuff
is called a sphygmomanometer.

629.379
Ha. A cardiac stress test,
a full-body MRI, an electromyogram...
633.675
633.842
...a CBC, baseline glucose, upper GI?
635.969
# SHELDON
636.136
Oh, and exploratory laparoscopy.
The last time I had hiccups...

at a pace you both are comfortable with.

like that to her.

Of course. Why don't you tell me
what you're feeling?

# PENNY
920.921
So you told her you wanted
to slow things down?

Not specifically. But, urn, I did
tell her that I had feelings.
928.053
# PENNY

Good. Good.
930.388
930.555
And then what?

got changed somehow.

**LOL**
984.609
Okay, here's the thing.
987.571
987.737
I'm afraid that if I ask her to move out,
she'll just dump me.
991.491
# PENNY
991.658
Well, that's a chance you have to take.
993.910
994.077
I mean, look, if it's
meant to be, it'll be.

1004.212
# PENNY
1004.838
I don't know.
What have women said to you...
1006.840
1007.007
...when they wanted
to slow a relationship down?
1009.676

# LEONARD
1046.296
What speech?
1047.922
# STEPH
1048.632
I really like you but maybe we should spend
a little less time together...
1053.345
1053.511
...because I need my space,
but I'll call you on Tuesday.
1056.931
1057.098
And then you never call me, so I call you,
but you don't call me back.
1060.560
1060.727
And then when I run into you
at the coffee shop...
1063.021
1063.188
...you pretend you have problems
with voice mail...
1065.565
1065.732
...and I know that you're lying
but I pretend like I don't care...
1069.194

but I'm sure if I did I wouldn't want one.
