Put it on the back burner.
11.554
12.513
Anyway, it occurs to me,
if I ever did perfect a time machine...
15.725
15.891
...I'd go into the past
and give it to myself.
18.019
18.185
Thus eliminating the need for me
to invent it in the first place.

Interesting.

It's time travel, Leonard.
I will have done that.

no original research in 25 years...

By the time we come to a stop...
400.401

...we'll be occupying the same space
as that Buick.

An impossibility that nature will quickly
resolve into death, mutilation and

449.450

The thing about tomatoes,
and I think you'll enjoy this...
452.453

but they're technically a fruit.

can only absorb so much.

Are you sure? There are a lot
of advantages to buying in bulk.
505.297

It doesn't spoil...

...and you're going to be needing them
for at least the next 30 years.

This is a natural human process and we're
talking about significant savings.

535.160
Now, if you assume 15 tampons per cycle
in a 28-day cycle
538.872
539.039
Are you fairly regular?
540.833
541.200

You called my mother?

# MRSCOOPER
670.754
Oh, you got yourself a loom. How nice.
674.174
# SHELDON
674.675
Thank you.
676.427
# MRSCOOPER
676.427
Honey, why did you get a loom?
678.178
678.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
679.012
I was working with luminous fish
and I thought, "Hey...
683.767
684.268
...loom."
686.353
685.600
**LOL**
687.854
Mom, what are you doing here?
690.023
# MRSCOOPER
690.190
Leonard called me.
691.608
# SHELDON
691.775
I know, but why?
693.902
# LEONARD
694.069
Because one of the great minds
of the 21st century...
696.530
696.697
...is raising glow-in-the-dark fish
and weaving serapes.
699.908
700.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
700.617
This is not a serape. This is a poncho.
702.869
703.036
A serape is open at the sides,
a poncho is closed. This is a poncho.
706.206
706.373
And neither is a reason
to call someone's mother.
710.502
709.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
711.044
Really?
When was the last time you left the house?
713.338
# SHELDON
714.131
I went to the market with Penny.
715.590
# LEONARD
715.757
Yeah, that was three weeks ago.
717.509
717.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
717.676
Well, then, buckle up.
718.719
718.885
In the next four to eight days,
she's going to get very crabby.
722.973
722.800
**LOL**
# MRSCOOPER
724.725
Sweetheart,
your little friend is concerned about you.
727.352
# SHELDON
727.519
Yes, well, I'm not a child.
728.812
728.979
I'm a grown man
capable of living my life as I see fit.
732.065
732.232
And I certainly don't need someone
telling on me to my mother.
735.402
735.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
736.862
Wait, where are you going?
738.113
# SHELDON
738.280
To my room and no one's allowed in.
741.325
740.700
**LOL**
# MRSCOOPER
742.951
He gets his temper from his daddy.
744.182
# LEONARD
744.182
Ah.
745.412
# MRSCOOPER
745.579
He's got my eyes.
746.767
# LEONARD
746.767
I see.
747.956
# MRSCOOPER
748.457
All that science stuff,
that comes from Jesus.
751.668
751.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
755.005
Sheldon, your mom made dinner.
756.506
756.673
I'm not hungry.
757.716
# MRSCOOPER
757.883
Oh. Leonard, don't trouble yourself.
He's stubborn.
760.802
760.969
He may stay in there till the rapture.
763.055
763.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
764.639
Are we so sure that's a bad thing?
766.892
766.700

# MRSCOOPER
767.059
I love the boy to death...
768.518
768.685
...but he has been difficult
since he fell out of me at the Kmart.
772.773
773.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
774.775
Excuse me for being so bold...
776.151
776.318
...but I now see where Sheldon gets
his smoldering good looks.
780.155
780.700
**LOL**
# MRSCOOPER
780.322
Oh. Honey, that ain't gonna work,
but you keep trying.
784.368
784.700
**LOL**
785.535
I made chicken.
786.953
787.537
I hope that isn't one of the animals
that you people think is magic.
792.125
792.400
**LOL**
797.506
You know, we have an Indian gentleman
at our church.
800.133
800.300
A Dr. Patel. It's a beautiful story.
802.552
802.719
The Lord spoke to him and moved him
to give us all 20 percent off on LASEK.
807.099
807.265
You know, those that needed it.
809.184
809.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
809.851
That is a lovely story.
811.645
811.812
Are we gonna do anything
about Sheldon?
813.563
# MRSCOOPER
813.730
Oh, we will.
You have to take your time with Sheldon.
816.274
816.441
His father, God rest his soul, used to
818.610
818.777
"Mary, you have to take your time
with Sheldon."
821.988
822.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
822.823
Sounds like a wise man.
824.241
# MRSCOOPER
824.241
Oh, not so wise.
825.659
825.826
He once tried to fight a bobcat
for some licorice.
828.912
829.400
**LOL**
829.788
So everybody grab a plate
and a pretty placemat that Shelly wove.
835.335
835.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
835.502
Has Shelly ever freaked out
like this before?
837.838
# MRSCOOPER
838.004
Oh, all the time.
839.047
839.214
I remember one summer
when he was 13...
841.425
841.591
...he built a small nuclear reactor
in the shed...
844.719
845.400
**LOL**
844.886
...and told everybody he was gonna provide
electricity for the town.
848.014
848.181
Well, the only problem was, he had no,
what you call, fissionable materials.
852.602
852.800
**LOL**
853.520
Anyway, when he went on the Internet
to get some...
856.273
856.440
...a man from the government came by
and sat him down real gentle...
860.902
857.200
**LOL**
861.069
...and told him it's against the law
to have yellow cake uranium in a shed.
864.865
865.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
866.199
Well, what happened?
867.304
# MRSCOOPER
867.304
Well, poor boy had a fit.
868.410
868.577
Locked himself in his room
and built a sonic death ray.
871.746
872.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
872.706
A death ray?
873.874
# MRSCOOPER
873.874
Well, that's what he called it.
875.041
875.208
Didn't even slow down the neighbor kids.
Heh.
877.377
879.300
**LOL**
878.920
It pissed our dog off to no end.
880.881
882.966
You know, you two make a cute couple.
885.218
# LEONARD
886.720
I-- No, no.
No, we're not a couple. We're singles.
889.514
889.681
Two singles. Like those individually
wrapped slices of cheese that...
894.728
894.400
**LOL**
895.979
Or friends.
898.106
# MRSCOOPER
898.648
Did I pluck a nerve there?
899.524
# HOWARD
899.524
Oh, yeah.
900.400
# MRSCOOPER
900.567
Okay.
All right, everybody, it's time to eat.
903.195
901.400
**LOL**
904.613
Oh, Lord, we thank you for this meal
and for all your bounty.
909.409
907.600
**LOL**
909.576
And we pray that you help Sheldon
get back on his rocker.
914.080
914.247
Now, after a moment of silent meditation,
I'm gonna end with "in Jesus' name"...
918.502
918.668
...but you two
don't feel any obligation to join in.
921.421
922.000
**LOL**
922.964
Unless, of course,
the Holy Spirit moves you.

Oh, my God,
this is the best cobbler I've ever had.

You know what the secret ingredient is?

You're a physicist. You belong at the
university doing research, not in your room.

Well, that looks awful fancy.
What is that?

It's my idea of what DNA would look like
in a silicon-based life form.
1002.419
1001.900

But intelligently designed
by a creator, right?

You know how your daddy used to say
that you can only fish for so long...
1014.723

...before you gotta throw
a stick of dynamite in the water?

1023.753
# SHELDON
1023.753
What for?
1024.691
# MRSCOOPER
1024.858
Because you're gonna go
to your office...
1026.735
1026.901
...apologize to your boss
and get your job back.

No.

# MRSCOOPER
1030.322
I'm sorry.

Did I start that sentence with the words
"if it please Your Highness"?
1035.327
1035.500

# SHELDON
1037.037
I'm not going to.
I didn't say anything that wasn't true.

# MRSCOOPER

Now, you listen here.
1041.291
1041.458
I have been telling you since you were 4.
1043.960
1044.127
It's okay to be smarter than everybody,
but you can't go around pointing it out.
1048.089
# SHELDON
1048.256
Why not?
1049.653
# MRSCOOPER
1049.653
Because people don't like it.

from the neighbor kids?

Now, let's get cracking.

Wouldn't have been any ass-kickings
if that stupid death ray had worked.

1115.782
...we may have gotten off
on the wrong foot...

1118.159
...when I called you an idiot.
