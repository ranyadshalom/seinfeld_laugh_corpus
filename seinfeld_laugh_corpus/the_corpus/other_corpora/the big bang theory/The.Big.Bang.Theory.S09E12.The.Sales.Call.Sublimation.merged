I'm glad to see you made it safely.

How's your hotel?
6.888
8.097
It's not the best
Best Western I've been to,
10.266
10.433
but I'd say
11.768
12.435
it's the third-best
Best Western I've been to.
14.521

**LOL**
# SHELDON
15.813
I know how you feel.
16.981
17.148
The Best Buy by my house
is only the third-best Best Buy.
20.652
21.400
**LOL**
21.945
They have the best buys,
but having the best buys
24.447
24.614
isn't the only thing
that makes a Best Buy the best Best Buy.
27.283
28.100
**LOL**
# AMY
29.994
What makes a best Best Buy
the best Best Buy?
32.956
# SHELDON
33.122
Hmm. That's a great question.
34.958
35.166
I like when they're next to a Chipotle.

# AMY

Okay, well, I should unpack.

All right.
Enjoy the neurobiology conference.

# AMY
43.925
I Will.
44.926

I wish you were here.

# SHELDON

At a neurobiology conference?
What a mean thing to say.

# AMY
53.268
Okay, I'm glad you're not here?

Oh! Good news, gentlemen.
66.030
66.197
Amy's at a conference this weekend,
67.991
68.157
which means I'm available
to be entertained.
70.952
71.494
As today's youth might put it,
who wants to get their Sheld-on?

# HOWARD
77.083
Bernie and I are getting the house ready
for the remodel.

We could always use
an extra pair of hands.

That sounds awful. Raj?

Uh, I've got time booked
in the telescope room all weekend
86.467
86.634
scanning for rogue planets.
87.885
88.052
You're more than welcome to join me.

That's the one to beat. Leonard?

I'm trying to get my Sheld-off.

Well, then, it looks like
we have a winner. Congratulations.

Well, I should warn you,
it's just looking at data

Hi. How was your day?
134.766
# PENNY
134.932
Uh, not good.
Still couldn't get in to see Dr. Gallo.
137.810
# SHELDON
138.353
A doctor?
139.604
140.600
**LOL**
141.397
Well, I hope you're not contagious.
142.797
142.940
I've got a weekend in the telescope room
144.484
144.567
I've been excited about
for almost three minutes.
146.487
146.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
148.738
I'm not sick. It's for work.
149.947
150.114
There's this doctor
who refuses to see any sales reps.
152.575
152.742
I've been trying to get in for months.
154.035
# LEONARD
154.118
Well, did you try wearing the shirt
I said was inappropriate for work?
157.080
157.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
157.372
Well, the doctor's a woman,
159.499
160.249
but yes, because you never know.
161.876
162.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
163.336
What kind of doctor is she?
164.416
# PENNY
164.545
Um. A psychiatrist. Why?
166.339
# HOWARD
166.589
Well, what if you make
an appointment as a patient?
168.883
169.050
Then you'll get to talk to her.
170.301
# PENNY
170.635
Yeah, they already know
I'm a pharmaceutical sales rep.
172.795
# RAJ
172.929
Oh, what if Leonard made an appointment
and tried to lay some groundwork for you?
176.391
# PENNY
176.933
That's interesting.
177.975
# LEONARD
178.434
Well, I'm not gonna make
a fake appointment with a psychiatrist.
180.978
181.145
What would I say is wrong with me?
182.480
# RAJ
182.563
Low self-esteem.
183.210
# HOWARD
183.210
Social anxiety.
183.857
# SHELDON
183.940
Sexual insecurity.

**LOL**
# LEONARD
187.652
None of that is true.
188.778

the list goes on and on.

# LEONARD
192.323
This is crazy.
193.366
193.533
How would my going in there even help you?
195.118
# PENNY
195.201
I don't know. You could talk to her,
and maybe if it comes up,
197.495
197.578
you could ask if she's heard
about the drug.
198.788
# LEONARD
198.871
What if I get caught?
200.071

200.206

226.232
I know.

# SHELDON
330.628
Well, I can be helpful.
Give me something to do.
333.047
333.214
You know, my father took me to work once,
334.882
335.049
and in ten minutes I figured out
336.342
336.509
who'd been stealing
from the cash register.
338.178
338.261
It was my father.
339.303
339.900
**LOL**
341.138
Yeah, Dad lost his job,
342.306
342.473
but Mr. Hinckley gave me a Fudgsicle.

345.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
346.435
Fine, you want something to do?
347.937
348.354
There's about six months of data
on this hard drive.
350.898
351.065
Why don't you go through it
and see if you can spot
352.859
352.942
any patterns or anomalies?
354.235
# SHELDON
354.402
Yep, I'm on it. Hey, look at that!
356.445
356.612
An Indian guy outsourcing a computer job
to a white fella.
359.615

# RAJ
362.410
Yeah, okay, whatever it takes
to keep you busy for a few hours.
365.079
# SHELDON
366.163
Found one.
367.248
367.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
368.165
No, you didn't.
369.208
369.792
There are millions of data points there.
371.794
# SHELDON
371.961
But, look, an optical transient.
374.297
# RAJ
375.423
Yeah, maybe that is something.
376.623
376.716
How did you find that?
377.654
# SHELDON
377.654
It wasn't difficult.
378.593
378.759
You know how when you see
prime numbers, they appear red,
381.554
381.721
but when they're twin primes,
382.930
383.097
they're pink and smell like gasoline?
385.016
387.100
**LOL**

387.184
No.
388.227
# SHELDON

I guess I'm a special boy.

**LOL**
392.440

394.067
394.150
he gets a Fudgsicle.

Well, I'm not so sure about that.

But I can tell you I do not agree
with her theories on child rearing at all.
424.347
# LEONARD
425.056
Really?
426.307
426.891
Any chance you find them
cold, cruel, and unsuitable

for innocent little boys
who just want to be happy?

a lot of that stuff. I'm better now.

446.327
# LEONARD
446.494
Do you know she never let me
celebrate my birthday
448.621
448.788
because being born
was her achievement, not mine?
450.873
451.300
**LOL**
# DRGALLO
452.541
That's heartbreaking.
453.584

when you asked me to move in

I'd still be here two years later?

we'll know what it is that we found.

Ooh, perhaps
it's a heliosheath scintillation.
546.969

Yeah, it could be
a trans-Neptunian object.

# SHELDON
549.305
Maybe it's a new planet.

Unlikely, but it could be a dwarf planet.

579.293
Yeah, me, too. I was stuck for a metaphor.
580.973
581.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
581.921
Come on, a medium-sized asteroid
is still an interesting discovery.
586.092
# SHELDON
586.467
I suppose it could end up
587.510
587.676
on a collision course with Earth
and destroy life as we know it.
590.679
# RAJ
592.306
You dream different than me.
593.724
594.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
596.393
It is kind of cute.
598.020
# RAJ
598.187
Yeah, it is.
And you know we get to name it.
600.022
# SHELDON
600.189
We better choose a name
no one can make fun of.
603.109
603.275
Sir Friedrich William Herschel
didn't do Uranus any favors.
606.195
606.900

# LEONARD
611.158
Hi.
612.221
# PENNY
612.221
Hey, how'd it go?
613.285
# LEONARD
613.452
Great. Dr. Gallo is terrific.
616.330
616.497
You know, I've always been insecure
618.290
618.457
that no one cares about what I have
to say, but she made me see
620.793
# PENNY
620.876
Yeah, no one cares.
Did you help me out or not?
622.716
622.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
623.504
Okay, now, what I'm hearing
625.714
625.881
is that you feel that I sometimes
take too long to express myself,
628.884
629.051
and you wish I'd be more succinct.
630.761
# PENNY
630.928
You're only hearing that
because I cannot roll my eyes any louder.
633.806
634.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
634.723
All right, well, after we talked about
my issues with my mother,
637.643
637.810
nothing too deep,
just how she ruined my life,
639.812
640.500
**LOL**
640.771
I told her about you and your drug.
She said she'd be happy to meet you.
643.608
# PENNY
643.691
Really?
Oh! You're the best husband ever!
647.194
# LEONARD
647.570
So, you'll go to the Doctor Who convention
with me next week?
650.614
651.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
651.991
I guess.
652.950
# LEONARD
653.117
Oh, I actually did hear
your eyes roll that time.
655.995
656.400
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
660.791
Boy, when was the last time
Stuart cleaned this place?
663.210
# HOWARD
663.377
No kidding.
664.378
664.545
Oh. Okay, I'm about to suck something up.
666.185
666.338
What do you think this object sounds like?
668.048
# BERNADETTE
668.257
Howie, I don't want to play
Lego, Toenail or Pill anymore.
671.093
671.800
**LOL**
673.512
So, what do you think
we should do with this room?
675.639
# HOWARD
675.806
Well, I was thinking
a home theater or a gaming room,
678.225
678.392
you know, like a man cave.
680.186
# BERNADETTE
680.352
Why can't it be a woman cave?
681.729
# HOWARD
681.896
As long as it has a home
theater, a video game system
683.815
683.898
and you're not allowed in it,
684.982
685.065
you can call it whatever you want.
686.425
686.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
687.943
I'm being serious.
689.236
# HOWARD
689.486
Well, what do you think we should do?
691.488
# BERNADETTE
691.655
I don't know, maybe a home office or...
694.617
694.992
on...
696.452
696.994
Look.
698.120
698.704
The teddy bear Stuart won
the night we took him to the fair.
701.064
702.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
703.083
He was so excited.
704.793
# BERNADETTE
705.419
Yeah.
706.420
706.629
You know, no matter how hard they tried,
708.131
708.214
they could not guess his age.
709.798
710.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
711.425
I'll give it to him next time I see him.
713.636
# BERNADETTE
714.303
Have you heard from him since he left?
715.325
# HOWARD
715.325
No.
716.347
716.639
You'd think he would've called
once he got settled in.
719.475
# BERNADETTE
720.100
Maybe he's busy.
721.122
# HOWARD
721.122
Too busy to call?
722.144
722.311
He wasn't too busy to binge-watch
Hot in Cleveland with my Hulu password.
725.648
726.300
**LOL**
728.984
What is happening?
730.110
730.736
Are we missing him?
732.488
# BERNADETTE
732.947
No, that's not what this feeling is.
735.491
736.533
Is it?
737.701
738.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
738.744
Of course not. He drove us crazy.
740.788
740.996
Like when you were gonna make that pie
743.374
743.540
and Stuart ate all the blueberries. God!
746.085
# BERNADETTE
746.252
And he tried to deny it,
but his teeth were all purple.
749.046
749.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
751.340
That was pretty cute.
753.175
# BERNADETTE
753.634
Yeah.
754.718
755.636
Ew, we are missing him!
757.012
757.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
761.016
So I was thinking,
maybe we can come up with a name
763.394
763.560
for the asteroid by combining our names.
765.854
# SHELDON
766.021
That's a great idea.
767.356
767.690
I've got it.
768.732
768.899
We'll call it Cooper.
770.734
772.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
773.821
How is that both our names?
775.281
# SHELDON
775.781
"Koo" from Koothrappali
and "per" from Cooper.
778.534
779.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
779.952
Yeah, so it's, like, Kooper with a "K"?
781.870
# SHELDON
782.371
Nah, you're right, that's dumb.
783.611
784.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
785.374
Hey.
786.396
# SHELDON
786.396
Leonard, great news.
787.418
787.584
We discovered
a medium-sized asteroid together.
790.879
# LEONARD
791.046
Wow! That's amazing!
792.548
792.715
I'm in a pretty great mood today myself.
794.633
# SHELDON
794.800
Okay. Guess we're gonna
talk about you now.
796.844
797.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
797.803
Well, we are,
because Dr. Gallo made me realize
800.597
800.764
that I'm a worthwhile person
and that my feelings matter.
803.392
# RAJ
803.726
I learned that for free
from a cat poster, but good for you.
806.478
807.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
809.606
Okay, back to me.
810.607
810.774
I discovered an asteroid,
and now I get to name it.
813.485
# RAJ
813.652
Wait, what happened to us?
815.112
# SHELDON
815.362
Now, this isn't about us,
816.405
816.572
this is about what's best
for the asteroid.
818.407
818.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
820.868
What are you thinking of naming it?
822.161
# SHELDON
822.244
I haven't settled on anything yet.
823.871
# RAJ
824.038
We haven't settled on anything yet.
825.622
# SHELDON
825.831
All right, way to go, Cat Poster.
You hang in there.
827.871
828.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
830.210
You know what'd be nice?
Name it after your girlfriends.
832.171
832.254
Show them how much you care.
833.374
# RAJ
834.882
That is a great idea.
835.903
# SHELDON
835.903
It's perfect.
836.925
837.092
It appears romantic, but it's really just
839.261
839.428
a rock in space that gets me
out of Valentine's Day forever.
842.056
842.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
844.600
So, uh, what were you thinking?
Combine their names?
846.894
# SHELDON
847.061
Mmm. I like it.
848.187
848.354
Yeah, we'll take the "A-M" from Amy
851.273
851.440
and the "Y" from Emily.
852.941
854.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
855.444
That's just Amy.
856.653
# SHELDON
856.820
Exactly. See how well we work together?
858.572
861.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
861.450
And in double-blind studies,
862.785
862.951
Placinex proved
extremely effective in treating
865.079
865.245
all kinds of anxiety.
866.789
866.955
Actually, funny story, the boys in the lab
868.999
869.166
were worried about getting
FDA approval for Placinex.
871.835
872.002
They started taking it, stopped worrying.
873.879
874.500
**LOL**
874.046
So...
875.047
# DRGALLO
875.631
Got it.
876.799
# PENNY
876.965
Do you have any questions?
878.133
# DRGALLO
878.300
Just one.
878.926
# PENNY
878.926
Mmm-hmm.
879.551
# DRGALLO
880.677
When you made your husband
pretend to be a patient
882.555
882.638
so you could get access to me,
what were you thinking there?
886.642
# PENNY
888.685
I just meant a question about the drug.
891.397
892.100
**LOL**
# DRGALLO
893.315
Yeah, I know what you meant.
894.400
894.483
Let's put that aside for a minute
and talk about why you married Leonard.
898.570
# PENNY
899.655
I don't wanna.
900.823
901.500
**LOL**
# DRGALLO
903.075
Here is a man
raised by an overbearing woman
905.285
905.452
who completely dominated
every aspect of his formative years.
908.831
909.415
Do you think
910.707
910.874
he's perpetuating that relationship
by seeking out a partner like you?
915.170
# PENNY
916.922
You know, I used to wear tank tops a lot.
920.092
920.259
That was a big selling point.
921.844
922.600
**LOL**
925.305
Hi, Sheldon. What's up?
926.515
# SHELDON
927.141
Good news. You're an asteroid.
929.393
930.200
**LOL**
# AMY
932.604
Uh. Please tell me what to say next.
935.357
935.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
937.025
Perhaps I should explain.
938.277
938.444
While working with Koothrappali,
939.862
940.028
we discovered an asteroid,
and I named it after you.
943.323
# AMY
943.991
On.
945.325
945.909
Sheldon, thank you. That's so romantic.
949.455
949.621
But what about Rajesh?
950.998
951.165
He was okay with you choosing the name?
953.041
# SHELDON
953.250
Well, it took a little negotiating,
but I wore him down.
955.961
956.128
We get the asteroid,
957.379
957.546
and if you and I have children,
959.256
959.423
they all have to be named Rajesh.
961.300
962.500
**LOL**
# AMY
964.011
All of them?
965.053
# SHELDON
965.220
Even the girls.
966.305
966.500
**LOL**
# AMY
969.183
Okay, I think I know what to say now.
971.059
973.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
973.812
How can I not sound like his mother
975.189
975.272
when our entire bedroom
is filled with Star Wars toys?
977.399
977.566
I mean, have you ever had sex
with a stuffed Wookiee watching you?
980.402
980.600
**LOL**
# DRGALLO
981.820
I went to college in the '70s.
It was a hairier time.
984.364
984.531
I'm gonna say yes.
985.741
986.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
987.242
You know, if anything,
he's turning me into his mother.
989.536
989.703
Before I did pharmaceutical sales,
I was an actress.
991.914
992.247
You know, I was pretty good.
993.624
993.790
You know, girl-next-door type, but hot.
996.251
996.502
Doable.
997.628
997.900
**LOL**
# DRGALLO
998.545
Hmm.
999.546
# PENNY
999.755
And not only am I Leonard's mother,
1001.298
1001.465
but we have this man-child
living with us named Sheldon.
1004.092
# DRGALLO
1004.510
Oh, Leonard talked a lot about him.
1007.012
1007.471
I wasn't sure if he was real.
1008.931
1010.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
1011.099
Yeah, he's as real as the fine I get
1012.768
1012.935
when I use too much toilet paper.
1014.686
1015.100
**LOL**
# DRGALLO
1016.522
Wow. You really do have
a lot on your plate.
1019.441
# PENNY
1019.608
I do.
1021.193
1022.361
You know, Leonard's right.
1024.404
1024.571
Talking to you is really helping.
1026.114
# DRGALLO
1026.281
Oh, I'm glad.
1027.783
1027.950
You know, you might also benefit
from a prescription for anxiety.
1031.787
# PENNY
1032.120
Okay, if you think it'll help.
1033.622
1033.789
Oh! Just don't make it Placinex.
1035.374
1035.541
I do not need
sudden fits of homicidal rage.
1037.751
1038.400
