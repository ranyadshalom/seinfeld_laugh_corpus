Twelve years ago...
15.652
15.808
...my cousin Irene
and her entire family died...
17.936
18.102
...in a horrific carbon-monoxide accident
the night before her wedding.

remain unused...
29.239
29.405
...and available to us for free.
31.616
32.400
**LOL**
32.951

Why?
731.982
# LEONARD
732.149
Her feelings got hurt because
you went dress shopping without her.
735.527
# BERNADETTE
735.694
I told you that would happen.
737.154
# PENNY
737.321
This is her first time being a bridesmaid,
and she's getting a little crazy with it.
741.492
# BERNADETTE
741.659
She keeps on telling us stories about
bridesmaid traditions in other cultures...
745.663
745.829
...and they're all about getting naked
and washing each other.
749.375
753.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
756.882
She keeps trying to figure out
if our cycles have synced up...
759.885
760.094
...so we can call ourselves
"The Three Menstra-teers."
763.097
763.500
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
765.015
We thought it would be easier
to look at dresses one time without her.
768.352
768.519
I feel terrible.
770.041
# PENNY
770.041
I know, me too. We'll talk to her.
771.563
771.730
Hey, wait, how did she find out?
773.357
# HOWARD
774.608
Raj did it. Ugh.
776.735
777.300
**LOL**
779.405
And he says he would do it again.
782.199
781.900
**LOL**
785.369
Okay, I'm sorry.
786.412
786.620
You sent me the picture.
I wasn't thinking.
788.872
# BERNADETTE
789.039
Oh, Howie.
790.478
# HOWARD
790.478
I'm usually pretty good at not blabbing.
791.917
792.126
You tell me tons of stuff
about these guys, and I never repeat it.
796.380
796.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
799.049
What do you tell him?
800.404
# BERNADETTE
800.404
Oh, you know, just pillow talk.
801.760
801.927
You guys have nothing to worry about.
804.388
# LEONARD
804.555
Did you talk about us
when we were dating?
806.932
# PENNY
807.141
No. All your little secrets are fine.
809.935
809.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
813.897
Yes, absolutely fine.
816.525
816.400
**LOL**
818.569
Ha-ha-ha. I'll tell you later.

Come on, tumor.

Mama needs
an aggressive little glioblastoma.
832.041
831.700
**LOL**
832.916
Yay, brain tumor.
835.544
836.086
Probably not the same reaction you had
when you got the news.
839.465

# AMY
843.761
What are you doing here?
845.220
# PENNY
845.387
Well, uh, we just wanted to apologize...
847.306
847.473
...for not bringing you with us
the other day.
849.641
# AMY
849.808
That's not necessary.
It's like Sesame Street
852.436
852.603
"One of these things
is not like the others.
854.730
854.897
One of these things should die alone."
857.316
857.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
858.484
No, come on, Amy,
let us make it up to you.
860.569
860.736
We'll have a girls' night.
We'll do whatever you want.
863.280
# BERNADETTE
863.447
We can go down to the Korean baths
and do that thing...
866.116
866.283
...where we wash each other.
868.452
868.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
869.787
With loofah mitts, no hands.
872.790
872.600
**LOL**
# AMY
874.249
It's okay. I'm glad this happened.
876.126
876.293
I can stop pretending
that some beautiful girl...
878.629
878.796
...and her cute-in-the-right-light friend
wanna hang outwith me.
882.216
881.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
882.841
Amy, we're really sorry.
884.468
# PENNY
884.468
Yeah, we feel awful.
886.095
# AMY
886.261
Don't. I'll be okay.
887.471
887.638
You're not the first girls I thought
were friends who ended up shunning me.
891.266
891.433
It's like elementary school, junior high,
high school, undergrad, grad school...
895.270
895.437
...and that semester abroad in Norway
all over again.
898.107
898.100

902.986
Look at this brain.
904.029

905.155
I don't really want to.

**LOL**
# AMY
907.866
This is us.
909.159
909.326
Bernadette, you are the analytical,
scientific left hemisphere.
912.830
912.996
Penny, you're the creative,
spontaneous right hemisphere.
915.999
916.166
And where's Amy?
918.043
918.752
She's right here.
919.878
920.045
The sad little tumor
no one wants to go dress shopping with.
923.298
923.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
926.552
Amy, you're not a tumor.

Did you know
that when Alexander Graham Bell...
943.360
943.527
...invented the telephone,
he proposed answering it with "ahoy"?
948.907
949.700
Ahoy.
951.535
951.300
**LOL**
953.287
I like it.
955.038
955.706
Amy? ls that you?
958.709
958.876
Have you been drinking?
961.003
961.170
I'm sorry, I bet my sweet what?

What's going on?
969.428
# SHELDON
969.595
Well, it would seem Amy is drunk
in a liquor-store parking lot.
973.891
# LEONARD
974.057
Really? Amy?
975.392

# LEONARD
1003.045
Amy, what are you doing here?
1004.421
# AMY
1004.588
Well, I came here
to get a bottle of wine...
1006.757
1006.924
...like Penny taught me to do
when you're sad.
1010.135
1010.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1011.261
Yeah, but why didn't you go back
to your apartment?
1013.889
# AMY
1014.056
Didn't you go to high school?
Parking lots are where cool kids hang out.
1018.393
1018.560
Not that the rat bastards
ever invited me.
1021.897
1021.900

# LEONARD
1022.064
Maybe we should get you home.

Hang on, hang on, hang on. Sheldon...
1025.400
1026.276
...what would it take
for you to go into that liquor store...
1029.238
1027.300
**LOL**
1029.404
...buy a bottle of hooch, take me
across the street to that motel...
1033.116
1033.283
...and have your way with me'?

# LEONARD
1038.580

# SHELDON
1044.169
I'm begging both of you,
please, let's go.

I know how you feel.

What do you want'?
1069.528
1069.695
Do you want me
to give the friendship bracelet back?
1072.197
# PENNY
1072.406
I never gave you a friendship bracelet.
1074.825
1075.300
**LOL**
# AMY
1075.993
When we met, I made one
and pretended you gave it to me.
1078.662
1078.829
You can have it back if you want.
1080.539
1080.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
1081.999
No, you made that for you.
I want you to have it.

# BERNADETTE
1086.712
We know you're upset,
and you have every right to be...

...but we'd like a second chance
to make things right.
1092.217
# PENNY
1092.718
We are really sorry.
1093.844
1094.011
We were trying to think of some way to
show you how much we care about you.
1097.973
# BERNADETTE
1098.473
Which is why
it would mean so much...
1100.183
1100.350
...if you would agree
to be the maid of honor at my wedding.
1103.562
# AMY
1103.729
What?
1104.855
1105.022
Wait, is this some kind
of practical joke?
1107.024
1107.190
Like in Norway when my "friends"
trapped me in a sauna with a horny otter?
1111.570
1111.400
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
1115.449
No. I-- I want you
to be the maid of honor.
1118.327
# AMY
1118.869
Oh, my gosh.
1119.953
1120.454
No one's ever asked me
to be the maid of honor.
1122.706
1122.873
Well, that's not true.
Once, but then they all died.
1126.501
1126.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
1128.879
So is that a yes?
1130.965
# AMY
1130.965
Yes, heh. Yes.
1133.050
1133.216
Oh, my gosh, I--
I have so much to do.
1135.010
1135.177
There's the bridal shower
and the bachelorette party.
1137.721
1137.888
What should we do for the bachelorette?
Oh, I know.
1140.390
1140.557
Go to a Native American sweat lodge,
take peyote, roll in mud...
1143.852
1144.019
...and paint symbols
on Bernadette's naked body.
1146.271
1146.480
So that's happening.
1147.898

I feel like crying.
Of course, I could be hormonal.
