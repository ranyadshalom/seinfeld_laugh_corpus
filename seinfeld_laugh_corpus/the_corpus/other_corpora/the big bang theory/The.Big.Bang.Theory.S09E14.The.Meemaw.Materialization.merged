Here's a fun postal fact.
6.346
6.763
You know, the inside of our mailbox
is under federal jurisdiction,
10.225
10.391
so if you broke my right thumb,
12.602
12.769
that's the Pasadena City Police, but if
you broke my left thumb, that's the FBI.
17.524
18.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
19.275
If I'm going to jail, I'm killing him,
not breaking his thumb.
21.715
# PENNY
21.819
Yeah.
23.446
22.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
23.821
Ooh, I got a letter from my Meemaw.
 Mmm. Smell this.
27.367
# PENNY
27.951
What is that?
29.494
# SHELDON
29.661
Roses, BENGAY and
Dr. Scholl's Foot Powder.
32.080
32.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
32.247
Ah, yup. Grandma by Calvin Klein.
35.250
35.600
**LOL**
37.502
You know, the last time
I got a handwritten letter
39.337
39.420
was from someone who told me
I park like a blind person.
42.465
# LEONARD
42.632
That someone has a name.
44.133
# SHELDON
44.300
Uh, thank you.
45.969
45.800
**LOL**
47.512
Oh, Meemaw got a new set of teeth.
49.305
50.100
**LOL**
50.974
Oh, but then she found her old ones.
52.976
53.300
**LOL**
53.935
Oh, so now the new ones
are just gonna be her church teeth.
56.771

Fun, like your Comic-Con Spock ears

Oh, it'll be nice to finally meet her.
73.246
# SHELDON
73.329
Oh, you are going to love her.
74.956
75.123
She is the kindest, sweetest woman
you'll ever meet.
78.167
78.334
Unless you're a gopher
digging up her vegetable garden.
80.837
81.600
**LOL**
82.380
In that case you can expect to have
your head bashed in with a shovel.
85.300

# SHELDON
112.869
That's not her, that's not her,
that's not her,
116.539

that's not her, that's not her, that's
not her, that's not her, that's not her.

Really? The old Asian man
is not your Meemaw?
125.465
126.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
127.967
And that's not helpful.
129.802
130.219
I got her an iPhone for Christmas,
I'll see where she is.
133.556
# LEONARD
133.848
Oh, that's nice, most people her age
don't embrace technology.
136.726
137.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
137.060
Oh, she doesn't even know she has it.
138.478
138.561
No, I had my sister slip it in her bag
so that I can track her like a sea turtle.
142.732
144.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
145.568
Same as when we lost you at the zoo.
147.570
# SHELDON
147.737
For the hundredth time, I smelled
kettle corn and couldn't find the cart.
151.074
151.900

# LEONARD
152.659
That still doesn't explain
how you ended up on a freeway divider.

# MEEMAW
173.930
Thank you.
175.223
# SHELDON
175.390
Oh, no. Now, you call her Constance.
I call her Meemaw.
177.767
177.934
You have your own Meemaw. It's not
my fault she died when you were four.
180.812
181.900
**LOL**
# MEEMAW
182.271
Is that nice to say to your friend?
184.774
# SHELDON

It isn't, Meemaw. Sorry, Leonard.

Can you please live with us forever?

# HOWARD
196.744
That's ridiculous,
if you had a super power
199.038
199.205
and spent your whole life
being told to suppress it,
201.958
202.125
when you finally decide to embrace
that power, why hide in isolation?
206.921
# RAJ
207.547
I'm sorry, and how much money
did your version of Frozen make?
211.467
212.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
214.220
I'm just saying, instead of Let It Go,
215.763
215.930
she should really sing Look At Me
Hiding in a Freezer Like a DOVEBAR.
218.650
218.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
219.809
She built an ice castle,
made a snow monster
222.478
222.645
and gave herself
a complete makeover in one day.
225.356
225.523
You know what I saw you do today?
226.941
227.108
Eat a block of cream cheese
straight from the foil
229.277
229.444
and lie about it to your wife.
230.903
231.400
**LOL**
# GIRL
233.531
Sorry for eavesdropping,
234.699
234.866
but did you know they actually had
the song Let It Go in place
237.660
237.827
before they finalized the story?
239.579
# RAJ
239.746
Yeah, that's true.
In fact, they liked the song so much
241.748
241.831
they retooled the whole script around it.
243.416
# GIRL
243.499
Which is probably why that movie sucks.
245.334
245.900

Here we are talking
about Frozen and yet you got burned.
248.892

# RAJ
249.672
I'm so sorry,
but how can you not like that movie?
252.759
# GIRL
253.009
I just think it gets more credit
than it deserves.
254.969
# HOWARD
255.052
Ah, that's what I said an hour ago.
256.116
# GIRL
256.116

You've been talking

You should've seen us after
The Good Dinosaur.
263.728

# RAJ
264.854
It was a classic western
set in the post-Jurassic period,
268.524
268.691
and it changed my life.

# SHELDON
275.323
Are you comfortable?

after 800 flights of stairs.

You were so cute, huffin' and puffin'.

There's Amy.
I just know you're gonna hit it off.

You both have the same fashion sense.

How was your trip?
303.184

303.351
Wonderful, and the pilot did
such a good job I gave him a butterscotch.
307.772

**LOL**
# AMY
308.773
That's great. And look at you,
sitting in Sheldon's spot.
311.609
311.776
You know, I don't even get to sit there.
312.777
# SHELDON
312.777

313.778
314.570
And you never will.
315.988

**LOL**
317.782
Ask her to do the tissue thing,
do it, ask her.
319.909
# AMY
321.786
Can I have a tissue?
322.766
# MEEMAW
322.766
Of course.
323.746
324.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
326.457
Isn't that the best?
She's like Grandma Spider-Man.
329.877

**LOL**
# MEEMAW
331.629
He's been saying that since he was little.
I still don't know what it means.
336.050
336.500

# SHELDON
336.884
Well, you two sit down and get to
know each other. I'll get your room ready.
339.846
# MEEMAW
339.929
Oh, now don't you go looking through
my suitcase for presents.
343.307
# SHELDON
343.683
If I did would I find any?
344.704
# MEEMAW
344.704
Maybe.
345.726
345.935
But you might also find
my brassieres and bloomers.
349.230
349.900

That's a risk I'm willing to take!

Well, this is so nice.
He is so excited to have you

Okay, now let's you and me
get something straight.
360.116
360.600
**LOL**
361.492
He may think
that I came to bake him cookies,
364.328
364.495
but the real reason is to size you up.
366.956
# AMY
369.917
Size me up?

but I'm not so easy.

# CLAIRE
451.582
That's perfect. Do you think I could
pick your brain for my movie sometime?
454.752

It's animated sci-fi for kids.
456.712
# RAJ

Sure, I love animated movies.

# AMY
508.973
I'm curious, why do you
call Sheldon "Moon Pie"?
512.101
# MEEMAW
512.435
Because he's so nummy-nummy
513.978
514.145
She could just eat him up.
515.375
515.375
She could just eat him up.
516.605
516.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
517.690
And I call her Meemaw because,
519.233
519.400
well, just look at her.

**LOL**
# MEEMAW

It's interesting that Leonard and Penny
know about his nickname
527.241
527.450
and you don't.
528.617
# AMY
529.535
Oh, well, now that I'm hearing it,
it does sound familiar.
533.748
# SHELDON
534.331
How could it? I never told you
and you never bothered to ask.

Well, now I know.

# MEEMAW
546.802
Oh, it's so wonderful that you modern gals
can have it all.
550.931
551.140
A husband and a full-time career.
553.976
# AMY
554.351
I have a relationship
and a full-time career, too.
557.146
# MEEMAW

That doesn't bode well.

# AMY
562.151
Why not?
You just said it's okay for her to work.
564.987
# MEEMAW
565.321
Well, Leonard doesn't need
as much tending to as Sheldon does.
569.492

And as Moon Pie explained, 
Leonard's work is more of a hobby.

Look, I get that you're protective
of your grandson,
583.964
584.215
but he's an adult now, and maybe
586.592
586.759
I understand what he needs
better than you do.

No, no, no. You have to like each other.

617.998
The minute you left the room
619.291
619.458
your precious Meemaw
started giving me a really hard time.
622.336
622.545
You know, I don't need this.
623.754
# MEEMAW
623.921
Let her go. And under no circumstance
will you give her that engagement ring.
628.884
629.700
**LOL**
# AMY
630.052
What ring?
631.178
# LEONARD
632.471
Maybe we should give them some privacy.

You have an engagement ring?
641.230
# SHELDON
642.314
Yes.
643.399
# AMY
645.109
Penny, did you know about this?
646.694
# PENNY
648.070
All right, let's go.
649.572
649.600
**LOL**
656.300
**LOL**
# AMY
656.453
When did you get an engagement ring?
658.330
# SHELDON
658.497
Well, my mother gave it to me
659.748
659.915
and I had been thinking about
giving it to you, but then we broke up.
663.043
# MEEMAW
663.210
Well, thank goodness for that.
664.920
# AMY
665.963
Sheldon, will you please tell
your grandmother to stay out of this?
668.603
# SHELDON
668.757
Oh, I don't think I could do that.
670.926
671.000
**LOL**
# MEEMAW
671.510
Sheldon, tell this girl that my ring
will never be on her finger.
675.472
# SHELDON
676.807
Yeah, I'm gonna opt out of that one, too.
678.767
679.300
**LOL**
# AMY
680.311
You know, who said
I even want to be engaged to him?
682.730
683.105
And if I do,
I don't need your hand-me-downs!
685.024
# SHELDON
685.191
All right, look. Let's remain calm
and analyze this situation.
689.486
689.653
You know, I realize that you've only
known each other for less than a day,
692.990
693.157
but is it possible this crankiness is
because your cycles have synced?
697.077
697.600
**LOL**
# MEEMAW
698.787
You leave the room
and let the grown-ups talk. Now!
702.374
# AMY
702.917
Don't speak to him like he's a child!
705.044
# SHELDON
705.461
Thank you. Now I'm gonna go next door
and play with Leonard.
708.797
709.400
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
712.635
Okay, so you met this girl,
you exchanged numbers
714.595
714.762
and you're gonna meet up with her.
715.972
# RAJ
716.055
Just to help her with her screenplay.
717.640
# BERNADETTE
717.848
Well, I guess that's not so bad.
719.225
# HOWARD
719.683
You weren't there, he was really flirting.
721.810
# RAJ
722.102
Hey, it's not my fault if American women
project their fantasies
725.439
725.606
on foreigners with the kind of
magical voice that grants wishes.
728.817
730.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
731.237
I'm sure it was harmless.
People flirt, no big deal.
733.948
# HOWARD
734.114
Really? So it's okay if I flirt--
735.658
# BERNADETTE
735.658
Not you, I own your ass.
737.201
737.200
**LOL**
739.536
The real question is,
where are you with Emily?
741.747
# RAJ
741.914
Uh, it's hard to say, I think we're good.
744.833
745.000
But things like this make me wonder
if Emily's really the right person for me.
748.337
748.504
I mean, did you guys ever
have doubts about each other?
750.423
# HOWARD
750.506
No, never.
751.423
# BERNADETTE
751.423
Absolutely.
752.341
752.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
752.841
What?
754.009
# BERNADETTE
754.176
Howie, you forget how much
of our early dates involved
756.512
756.679
you doing magic and me doing this.
758.889
760.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
761.976
Fine. I had reservations about you, too.
764.353
# BERNADETTE
764.520
No, you didn't.
765.583
# HOWARD
765.583
No, I didn't.
766.647
766.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
768.065
Well, it doesn't matter now,
'cause I love how things worked out.
770.651
# HOWARD
771.277
Me, too. I think you're
even more beautiful than this rose.
775.197
776.000
**LOL**
781.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
781.287
Wow. You know,
the last time I saw my grandma,
784.164
784.373
the most exciting thing was watching
the ash of her cigarette get longer
787.213
787.376
and wondering if it was gonna
fall in her pudding.
789.378
790.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
791.213
Did it?
792.214
# PENNY
792.381
Yeah, right in there,
she ate it and everything.
794.425
794.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
795.676

796.322
796.322
SHELDON: Leonard and Penny?
796.969
797.052
Leonard and Penny?
Leonard and Penny?
798.804
# PENNY
798.971
Come in!
800.222
# LEONARD
801.056
Hey, what happened? ls Amy gone?
802.349
# SHELDON
802.516
No, they asked me to leave
so they could speak privately.
806.020
# PENNY
806.270
Uh-oh.
807.271
# SHELDON
807.271
Yeah, I know, it was quite tense.
808.272
808.439
So here's the million-dollar question.
810.649
810.816
Who wants to pop over there
and get my trains?
813.068
814.000
**LOL**
# RAJ
817.406
All right, I've made up my mind.
819.116
819.283
I'm gonna do the right thing,
call this girl,
820.993
821.076
and let her know
that I'm in a relationship.
822.787
# HOWARD
822.870
Okay, so far we've heard,
"Made up my mind, I'm dumping Emily."
825.873
# BERNADETTE
826.040
"Made up my mind to date both of them
by pretending to be twin brothers."
829.418
830.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
831.503
And, "Made up my mind,
I'll ask for a threesome,
833.172
833.255
"and if they say no,
I'll play it off as a joke."
835.466
835.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
836.425
I'm calling her. And the threesome
didn't deserve the belly laugh it got.
840.387
841.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
841.889
You're right. It could totally happen.
844.516
844.900
**LOL**
845.851
CLAIRE: Hello?
846.476
# RAJ
846.476
Hi.
847.102
847.436
Hi, yeah, it's Raj.
Rajesh, we met at the comic book store.
850.439
# CLAIRE
850.689
Hey, what's up?
Figure out what time you're free?
852.775
# RAJ
852.941
Actually, that's why I'm calling. I, um...
854.860
855.110
I just, I need to let you know
that I have a girlfriend.
858.030
# CLAIRE
858.614
Okay, good for you.
859.907
861.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
861.325
Well, no, no, I didn't want to mislead you
after you asked me out.
864.286
# CLAIRE
864.787
I didn't ask you out,
I just need help with my screenplay.
867.873
# RAJ
868.624
Wait, are you saying
that we didn't have a vibe?
870.542
# CLAIRE
870.709
Why do you care if we have a vibe?
You have a girlfriend.
872.961
# RAJ
873.128
Come on, I just told you
I have a girlfriend,
874.588
874.671
the least you can do is tell me
if we had a vibe.
876.673
877.000
**LOL**
# CLAIRE
878.634
Sure, we had a vibe.
879.968
# RAJ
879.968
I knew it! Okay, we did have a vibe.
881.303
882.100
**LOL**
882.304
This is exciting, what's my next move?
884.640
# BERNADETTE
885.099
You still have a girlfriend.
886.219
# RAJ
886.892
Right. Good catch.
888.143
888.800
**LOL**
889.353
Anyway, so I'm sorry to waste your time,
and good luck with your screenplay.
893.107
# CLAIRE
893.315
Hang on. We're both adults,
895.150
895.317
we can still get together
without it meaning anything.
897.569
# RAJ
897.736
Not me. Ever since you admitted we had
a vibe I've been planning our wedding.
901.240
902.300
**LOL**
# CLAIRE
904.118
Look. It's just coffee.
905.702
906.203
I'll ask you some questions about science
and if you propose, I promise to say "no."
910.332
# RAJ
910.916
Okay. Well that hurts a little, but okay.
913.252
913.500
**LOL**
# CLAIRE
914.920
Great, I'll text you.
915.816
# RAJ
915.816
Bye!
916.713
918.340
All right. So, we're meeting for coffee,
like two adults.
921.510
921.677
Everybody's happy, easy-peasy.
923.554
# BERNADETTE
924.138
Are you gonna tell Emily?
925.180
# RAJ
925.722
Yeah, of course, we have no secrets.
927.599
# HOWARD
928.600
When are you gonna tell Emily?
930.102
# RAJ
932.438
He lied about the cream cheese,
he ate the whole thing, I saw him!
935.149
935.600
**LOL**
# AMY
938.694
Look, I know you think I'm not right for
Sheldon, but trust me, I'm his best shot.
942.823
943.073
You have no idea how much I put up with.
944.867
# MEEMAW
945.159
I know more than you think I do.
947.161
# AMY
947.536
Really? You know what it's like
to have date night ruined
949.955
950.122
because Google changed their font?
951.748
953.000
**LOL**
# MEEMAW
953.041
Young lady. If you think
I don't know what it's like
956.753
956.920
to live with a stubborn, egotistical man,
then you're wrong.
960.549
961.008
'Cause that was my husband.
962.551
# AMY
963.719
Really?
964.887
# MEEMAW
965.846
There were days I wanted
to fill his pockets with corn
969.057
969.224
and toss him in the pig pen.
970.893
972.000
**LOL**
# AMY
973.061
Well, if you understand, then why are you
giving me such a hard time?
976.899
# MEEMAW
977.107
Because when you broke up with Sheldon
it hurt him deeply,
980.235
980.402
and I don't wanna see that happen again.
982.613
# PENNY
984.907
Hi, sorry. Sheldon would like to say
something to you.
988.076
# SHELDON
988.410
SHELDON: No, I wouldn't.
989.310
# LEONARD
989.310
Just get in here.
990.210
990.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
992.414
Hello.
993.186
# PENNY
993.186
Go ahead.
993.957
# SHELDON
994.625
Meemaw, I'm sorry, but...
997.753
998.587
I have to defend my girlfriend to you.
1000.881
# AMY
1001.632
Oh, Sheldon, thank you.
1003.884
# SHELDON
1004.051
Oh, great, now you're gonna get emotional.
1005.731
1008.200
**LOL**
1011.767
I always looked up to you and Pop-Pop.
1013.769
1014.186
I know what a challenging man he could be,
1016.939
1017.147
but I saw you stand by him and
make him into a better person.
1021.276
# MEEMAW
1021.693
I did.
1022.736
# SHELDON
1022.903
Well, that is exactly what I've been doing
the last five years
1025.781
1025.948
with this little work in progress.
1027.991
1028.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1031.286
He never disappoints, does he?
1033.121
1033.700
**LOL**
# AMY
1034.206
I think what Sheldon means to say,
1036.959
1037.626
is we've both grown together.
Isn't that right?
1040.671
# SHELDON
1041.129
Well--
1041.630
# PENNY
1041.630
Say yes!
1042.130
# SHELDON
1042.339
Yes.
1043.423
1043.400
**LOL**
# MEEMAW
1044.466
Fine. If you feel so strongly,
I won't stand in your way.
1048.345
# SHELDON
1049.137
Thank you.
1050.222
# AMY
1050.389
So if he wanted to give me
that engagement ring,
1053.308
1053.475
we would have your blessing?
1055.060
# MEEMAW
1055.727
I suppose.
1057.062
1060.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1062.734
I just gave you my virginity,
woman, cool your jets!

# RAJ
1073.537
Yeah, see, if you just change the story
to the destruction of a galaxy,
1078.333
1078.667
then a super massive
black hole could work.
1080.836
# CLAIRE
1081.253
This is great. Thank you so much.
1083.964
1084.840
I just gotta figure out a way
1086.425
1086.633
for everyone to die that
isn't too scary for children.
1088.753
1089.800

And that's how Mommy and Daddy met!
