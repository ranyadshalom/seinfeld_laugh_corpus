You know who's gotta be the bravest
person in the Marvel Universe?

Whoever has to give She-Hulk
a bikini wax.

# HOWARD
10.678

# SHELDON

As usual, you're all wrong.
23.524

Bravest person in the Marvel Universe
is the doctor...
26.193
26.360
...who gives Wolverine his prostate exam.
28.404
29.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
29.947

a prostate exam from Wolverine?

# SHELDON
33.993
Now you're just being silly.
36.245

Wolverine's never displayed interest
in helping others prevent prostate cancer.

Hello?
46.422
46.589
Yes, the elevator's out of order.
You'll have to use the stairs.
50.259
50.426
Of course you can.
51.510
51.677
Pizza dates back to the 16th century...
53.971
54.138
...while the first elevator
was not installed until 1852.
57.224
57.600
**LOL**
57.391
That means that for over 300 years...
59.769
59.935
...people carried pizzas upstairs.

Are you sure you have enough comics?
154.989
155.156
You're monitoring the telescope
for 12 hours, and by my estimate...
158.367
158.534
...you've only selected seven hours
of reading material.
161.495
162.000
**LOL**
162.496
That's even factoring in your difficulty...
164.540

# SHELDON
186.520
I don't care
for novelty editions of Monopoly.
188.898

I prefer the classics, regular and Klingon.

192.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
193.778
Actually,
Indian Monopoly's just like regular.
195.905
196.071
Except the money's in rupees,
instead of hotels you build call centers...
200.493
200.300

200.659
...and when you pick a Chance card
you might die of dysentery.

You'll never guess what happened.
212.505
# SHELDON
212.713
You went out in the hallway,
stumbled into a portal...
215.758
215.925
...which brought you 5000 years
into the future...
218.344
217.800

218.511
...where you took advantage
of the technology to build a time machine.
221.847
221.700

222.014
Now you're back to bring us all to 7010,
where we are transported...

telepathically-controlled flying dolphins?

What kind of a kiss?
242.910
# LEONARD
242.910
A big kiss, on the mouth.
244.578
# HOWARD
244.745
Is it possible
that she was going for your cheek...
247.248
247.414
...and you moved
and she accidentally got lip?
249.583
249.750
That happens with me and my mom
all the time.
252.837
252.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
253.879
She introduced me to her father...
255.548
255.714
...kissed me
and then shut the door in my face.
258.217
258.717
She was trying to send you a message.
260.511

You think?

# LEONARD
269.436
Penny kissing me is not insane.
She used to kiss me all the time.

Einstein defined insanity as doing
the same thing over and over again...
276.610
276.777
...and expecting different results.
278.988
279.100

By that standard,

You're the first guy

When I told him we split up,
he was heartbroken.

353.729
He kept bugging me, "How's Leonard?"
"Why can't you get back together?"
357.191
357.358
"I bet Leonard never tipped a cow
over on himself."
