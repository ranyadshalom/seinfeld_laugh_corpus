Hello, Howard.
747.498
747.665
I've realized that you scaring me
was all in jest.
751.335
751.543
Allow me to say, job well done.
755.506
756.800
**LOL**
760.400
**LOL**
766.976
Perfect.
768.602

# LEONARD
771.480
What are you doing?
773.565
# SHELDON
773.565
Science. You wouldn't understand.
775.651
775.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
776.610
Okay, well, see you. I'm going out.
779.571
# SHELDON
786.704
I thought you were leaving
the apartment.
788.956
# LEONARD
789.581
Yeah, me too.
I can't make up my mind.
791.709
# SHELDON
792.459
Are you concerned because the world
is filled with big dogs and bullies?
797.381
796.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
798.507
No, I'm having a moral crisis.
800.718
# SHELDON
801.844
Well, if it's of any help, I've read all
the great moral philosophers...
806.640
806.807
...including Dr. Seuss.
808.851
809.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
811.228
Oh, what the hell?
813.147
813.314
I'm supposed to go see that
girl from the comic book store, Alice.
816.483
816.650
But I don't know if I should, because I'm
going outwith Priya, but she's in India.
820.738
# SHELDON
820.904
All right.
So the topic at hand is sexual fidelity.
825.576
825.743
Probably won't be relying
on Seuss here.
828.620
829.000
**LOL**
829.538
Although One Fish Two Fish
Red Fish Blue Fish...
831.832
831.999
...might be surprisingly applicable.
834.251
833.700
**LOL**
835.252
Go on.
836.879
# LEONARD
836.879
Well, uh, they say at the end of your life...
838.505
838.672
...you regret the stuff you didn't do
more than the stuff that you did.
842.092
842.259
And I'm pretty sure Alice is the stuff
I wanna do.
846.388
846.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
847.848
You know, the German philosopher
Friedrich Nietzsche...
851.268
851.435
...believed that morality
is just a fiction...
854.772
854.938
...used by the herd of inferior
human beings...
857.608
857.775
...to hold back the few superior men.
860.778
# LEONARD
861.862
That actually does help.
863.197
# SHELDON
863.947
It's worth noting
that he died of syphilis.
866.784
866.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
871.455
Screw it, I'm going.
872.748
# SHELDON
872.915
On your way home,
will you pick up orange juice?
875.250
# LEONARD
875.417
Do you mind? I'm questioning
a lot of things in my life.
877.961
# SHELDON
878.170
Is one of those things
your fondness for orange juice?
880.964
# LEONARD
882.049
No.
882.883
# SHELDON
882.883
Great. Tropicana, no pulp.

Hey, Sheldon.
894.562
894.562
Who is it?
895.729
896.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
896.480
It's me, Sheldon, Mrs. Wolowitz.
898.482
# HOWARD
898.690
That's not my mom. It's Bernadette.
902.111
901.500

# SHELDON
903.487
Really? That's very unsettling.

Hi, Sheldon.

# SHELDON
908.034
Hi.
909.118
# HOWARD
909.284
What's up?
910.535
# SHELDON
910.535
It just occurred to me...
911.787
911.954
...that I never formally congratulated you
on your pending nuptials.
915.624
915.791
I hopped on the first bus and hightailed
it down here to shake your hand.
919.962
920.129
Put her there, you old so-and-so.
923.257
922.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
923.632
Well, uh-- I'm gonna see you
at work in 12 hours.
926.593
926.760
Don't you think
it could have waited until then?
929.012
# SHELDON
930.514
Holy smoke,
why didn't I think of that?
933.016
933.183
You're a better man than I,
Howard Wolowitz.
935.269
934.100
**LOL**
935.436
You put her there, you son of a gun.
938.439
937.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
939.189
Whatever. Heh.

**LOL**
946.738
Oh, my God, Howie!
What did you do?
949.700
# SHELDON
949.867
It was a harmless Halloween prank.
Look.
952.286
# BERNADETTE
952.453
Howard has a heart condition.
You know that.
955.038
# SHELDON
955.247
Well, I thought he made that up.
956.999
957.166
Isn't hypochondria a common
idiosyncrasy of Jewish people?
960.961
958.000
**LOL**
961.300
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
964.882
This is adrenaline.
We're gonna inject it into his heart.
967.551
# SHELDON
967.759
We are?
968.865
# BERNADETTE
968.865
You are. I'm not strong enough...
969.970
970.137
...to get it through his chest plate
and we've only got one shot.
973.307
973.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
974.057
Oh, no, I can't!
976.268
# BERNADETTE
976.894
Hurry! We're running out of time!
978.896
# SHELDON
980.397
Okay.
981.043
# BERNADETTE
981.043
Just do it!

Oh, God! One, two, three.

1008.592
Is it my tongue stud?
1009.593

If that freaks you out,
you're in for a real surprise later.

# LEONARD
1012.846
No, no, no. I can't do this.

Believe me, I really want to.
1018.352
# ALICE
1018.519
But?
1019.687
# LEONARD
1019.687
But I kind of have a girlfriend.

1021.605
Are you kidding?

1023.336
Uh, you're cool with being friends, right?

# ALICE
1025.234
Heh. I don't believe this.

# ALICE
1029.029
Heh. I'm so stupid.
I thought for once I'd met a good guy...
1032.699
1032.866
...but you're just another jackass.
1035.077
# LEONARD
1035.077
Oh, no, you have it wrong.
1037.287
1037.200

No, I was going to be a jackass,
but I stopped myself.
1041.917
1042.000
**LOL**
1042.960
I stayed a good guy,
so I'm gonna pass on the sex.
1046.588
1046.755
But you should know,
that's not a comment on your hotness...
1050.050
1050.217
...but on my goodness.
1052.594
1052.500
**LOL**
1052.761
That's kind of my superpower.
I'm-- I'm like Captain Good Guy.

It's okay. Did the right thing.

# LEONARD
1079.997
Okay, uh, here it is.
1083.083
1083.250
I met this girl and I kissed her
and I feel terrible about it.
1086.420
1086.587
But it's done,
it's never gonna happen again...

A couple of weeks ago,
I slept with my ex-boyfriend.
