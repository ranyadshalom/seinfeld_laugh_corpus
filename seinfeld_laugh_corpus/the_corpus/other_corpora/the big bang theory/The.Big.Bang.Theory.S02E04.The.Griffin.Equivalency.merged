54.221
I had to sanitize my hands
because the university...
56.724
56.891
...replaced the paper towels
in the restrooms with hot-air blowers.
60.019
# PENNY
60.186
I thought the blowers were more sanitary.
62.229
62.396
Why?
63.085
63.085
Really, don't.
63.773
63.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
64.148
Hot-air blowers are incubators
and spewers of bacteria and pestilence.
68.527
68.694
It'd be more hygienic
if they had a plague-infested gibbon...
71.489

Oh, yeah, 2008-NQ Sub-17.

Anyway, because of my discovery...
119.286
119.453
...People magazine is naming me
one of their 30 Under 30 to Watch.

Excuse me, 30 what under 30 what
to watch what?

**LOL**
# RAJ
131.966
Thirty visionaries
under 30 years of age to watch...
134.385
134.552
...as they challenge
the preconceptions of the fields.
137.763
# SHELDON

If I had a million guesses,
I never would have gotten that.
140.933

They've got me in with a guy doing
something about hunger in Indonesia...
145.396
145.563
...a psychotherapist using dolphins
to rehabilitate prisoners...
148.649
148.816
...and Ellen Page,
star of the charming independent film Juno.

Do I get a mention...
162.288
162.455
...for designing the telescope camera

165.332
# RAJ
165.499
Sorry, it's not part of my heartwarming
and personal narrative...
168.544
168.711
...in which a humble boy
from New Delhi...
170.880
171.046
...overcame poverty and prejudice and
journeyed to America to reach for the stars.

# HOWARD
175.634
Poverty? Your father's a gynecologist.
He drives a Bentley.

180.181
It's a lease.
181.557
181.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
184.727
I'm confused. Was there
some sort of peer-review committee...
188.689
188.856
...to determine which scientists
would be included?
191.192
# RAJ
191.358
Peer review? It's People magazine.
People picked me.
195.070
195.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
195.529
What people?
196.927
# RAJ
196.927
The people from People.
198.324

**LOL**
# SHELDON
198.491
What? Yeah, but exactly
who are these people?
200.910
201.076
What are their credentials?
How are they qualified?
203.746
203.913
What makes accidentally noticing
a hunk of rock...
206.332
206.499
...that's been traipsing around
the solar system for billions of years...
209.379
209.543
...more noteworthy than any other scientific
accomplishment by someone under 30?

Really? Do tell.

# SHELDON
297.840
How will Raj ever reach true greatness
if his friends lower the bar for him?
301.510
301.969
When I was 11, my sister bought our father
a "world's greatest dad" coffee mug.
306.140
306.307
And frankly, the man coasted
until the day he died.
309.476
309.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
310.978
Okay, let's try it this way.
312.479
312.646
What if this People magazine thing
is the best Raj is going to achieve?
315.900
# SHELDON
317.651
I had not considered that.
319.132

He can feel sadness?
327.745

Well, then fake it. Look at me.
341.508

I could be grinding on the fact that
without my stabilizing telescope mount...

345.471
...he never would have found
that stupid little clump of cosmic schmutz.

You guys aren't going?
656.698

I can't believe you. Raj is celebrating
a tremendous accomplishment.
660.994
661.161
You're not gonna be there?
662.663
# SHELDON
662.829
A tremendous accomplishment would be
if the planetary body he discovered...
666.291
666.458
...were plummeting toward Earth
and he exploded it with his mind.
669.753
670.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
671.380
That would be cool.
I'd go to that reception.
674.216

**LOL**
# PENNY
674.675
Come on, this is huge.
Raj is gonna be in People magazine...
677.552
677.719
...and he didn't even have to knock up
one of the Spears sisters.
681.056
680.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
681.974
Would you like to go with me?
684.017

Shame on you guys.
690.148
# RAJ
692.901
Look at that, I got a date with Penny.

I can't believe it took you a whole year.

731.231
731.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
732.232
Um, yeah. Starting with the champagne
a little early, aren't you?
735.652
# RAJ
735.819
It was in the limo.
They sent a limo. I have a limo.
738.655
738.822
I just love saying "limo." Here.
741.366
740.800
**LOL**
741.783

That's what you're wearing?

**LOL**
# PENNY
748.665
Um, yeah. Why? What's wrong with it?
750.917
# RAJ
751.293
Nothing. I was just hoping for something
a little more, you know, ridonkulous.
756.798
756.900

# PENNY
762.929
Yeah. Well, this is all the "donkulous"
you're gonna get tonight.

You're just gonna
sit around here and mope...
834.918
835.085
...while Penny is out with Dr. Apu
from the Kwik-E-Mart?
838.839
838.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
839.256
It's not a date and that's racist.
842.008
# HOWARD
842.175
It can't be racist.
He's a beloved character on The Simpsons.
846.513

# LEONARD
847.431
Let's just eat so I can get to bed.

With any luck, tonight will be the night
my sleep apnea kills me.
853.270

**LOL**
# SHELDON
857.065
Did you ask for the chicken to be diced,
not shredded?
859.526
# LEONARD
859.693
Yes.
860.777
# SHELDON
860.777
Even though the menu specifies shredded?
861.862
# LEONARD
862.028
Yes.
862.737
# SHELDON
862.737
Brown rice, not white?
863.447
# LEONARD
863.613
Yes.
864.781
# SHELDON
864.781
Did you stop and get the hot mustard?
865.949
# LEONARD
866.116
Yes.
867.179
# SHELDON
867.179
Did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce?

Just sit down and eat.
876.877
# SHELDON
876.877
Fine.
878.378
# LEONARD
881.465
All right, it's shredded.
What do you want me to do?
884.050
883.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
884.217
I want you to check
before you accept the order.
886.386
# LEONARD
886.553
Sorry.
888.180
# SHELDON
889.055
Were you distracted
by the possibility...
890.807
890.974
...that Koothrappali might have intercourse
with Penny tonight?
893.810
893.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
896.396
He's not going to have intercourse
with Penny.
898.482
# SHELDON
898.648
Then there's no excuse for this chicken.
900.567
901.300
**LOL**
902.652
You know, this situation with Koothrappali
brings to mind a story from my childhood.
907.657
# HOWARD
907.824
Oh, goody,
more tales from the panhandle.
910.744
910.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
910.911
That's Northwest Texas.
I'm from East Texas, the Gulf region...
914.039
914.206
...home to many Vietnamese shrimpers.
917.000
916.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
917.501
Do the shrimpers feature in your story?
919.669
# SHELDON
920.754
No.
922.172
921.800
**LOL**
922.923
Anyway, when I was 8...
925.300
925.467
...a Montgomery Ward delivery van
ran over our family cat, Lucky.
930.180
931.200
**LOL**
# HOWARD
931.640
"Lucky"?
932.579
# SHELDON
932.579
Yes, "Lucky."
933.517
# LEONARD
933.683
He's irony impaired. Just move on.
936.353
936.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
937.103
Okay, dead cat named Lucky. Continue.
939.940
# SHELDON
940.106
While others mourned Lucky...
941.775
941.942
...l realized his untimely demise provided
me with the opportunity to replace him...
946.238
946.404
...with something
more suited to my pet needs.
948.698
948.865
A faithful companion
that I could snuggle with at night...
951.535
951.701
...yet would be capable of killing
upon telepathic command.
955.622
954.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
957.499
So not a puppy?
959.751
959.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
959.960
Please. No, nothing so pedestrian.
961.753
961.920
I wanted a griffin.
964.548
964.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
965.465
A griffin?
967.342
# SHELDON
967.342
Yes, half eagle, half lion.
969.219
# LEONARD
970.011
And mythological.
972.389
972.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
973.181
Irrelevant.
974.558
975.392
Yeah, I was studying
recombinant DNA technology...
977.644
977.811
...and I was confidant
I could create one...
979.896
980.063
...but my parents were unwilling to secure
the necessary eagle eggs and lion semen.
984.818
985.500
**LOL**
986.820
Of course, my sister got swimming lessons
when she wanted them.
990.073
992.400

# HOWARD
992.492
Sheldon, not that we don't all enjoy
a good lion-semen story...
997.831
997.000
**LOL**
998.415
...but what's your point?
999.499
# SHELDON
999.666
My point is, if Koothrappali is moving on to
a new life of shallow, undeserved fame...
1005.130
1005.297
...then perhaps this is an opportunity
to create a better cohort.
1008.925
# LEONARD
1009.384
You wanna breed a new friend?
1012.095
1011.500

# SHELDON
1013.013
That's one option, but who has the time?
1015.181
1016.300
**LOL**
1015.849
But consider this.
1017.142
1017.309
The Japanese, they're doing some wonderful
work with artificial intelligence.
1020.854
1021.021
Now, combine that with some animatronics
from the imagineers over at Disney.
1025.233
1025.400
Next thing you know, we're playing "Halo"
with a multilingual Abraham Lincoln.
1030.030

1030.697
Sheldon, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're insane.
1034.284
1034.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1035.201
That may well be, but the fact is it
wouldn't kill us to meet some new people.
1039.289
# SHELDON
1039.456
For the record,
it could kill us to meet new people.
1042.375
1042.600
**LOL**
1044.002
They could be murderers
or the carriers of unusual pathogens.
1048.006
1047.700
**LOL**
1048.506
And I'm not insane.
My mother had me tested.
1051.968
1051.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1055.388
If we do get a new friend,
he should be a guy you can trust.
1058.224
1058.391
You know, a guy who has your back.
1060.226
# HOWARD
1060.393
He should have money and live in a cool
place by the beach where we throw parties.
1064.064
# SHELDON
1064.230
He should share our love of technology.
1066.316
# HOWARD
1066.316
And he should know a lot of women.
1068.401
1068.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1068.735
Okay, let's see, money, women, technology.
Okay, we're agreed.
