Hey, so I saw a movie trailer
the other day.
5.553
5.720
How could Batman possibly fight Superman?
7.722
7.889
I mean, isn't that dumb?
9.265
# BERNADETTE
9.432
Maybe he uses Kryptonite.
10.600
# EMILY
10.850
Well, Batman's got a lot of money,
12.268
12.435
maybe he builds a suit
that can do everything Superman can do.
15.021
# PENNY
15.605
No, no, no. I've seen that movie,
it's called Iron Man.
18.107
21.400
**LOL**
23.696
What do you do
when Batman wins?
24.865
24.948
Well, it depends on...
26.032
# LEONARD
26.115
What is happening?
27.450
# HOWARD
28.451
I don't know.
29.702
# RAJ
31.120
But it's beautiful.
32.872
33.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
34.290
Yeah, and now Ben Affleck is Batman?
36.000
# EMILY
36.167
Oh, he was great in Shakespeare in Love.
38.086
# PENNY
38.253
Ooh, we should
watch that next girls' night.
39.796
# BERNADETTE
39.879
We could do a double-feature with
the Leonardo DiCaprio Romeo and Juliet.
43.007
# PENNY
43.174
Oh, I love me some Leo.
44.717
# LEONARD
44.884
And it's gone.
46.302
47.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
48.304
Oh, hello, everyone. lam happy
to report I'm feeling much better.
52.225
# LEONARD
53.017
Good for you.
53.768
# SHELDON
53.768
Yeah, yeah.
54.519
54.700
**LOL**
54.769
My fever is gone,
my sinuses are pressure-free,
57.689
57.855
and my mucus is as clear
as a Yosemite waterfall.
61.025
61.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
62.944
Glad to hear it.
64.153
# SHELDON
66.197
I'll be able to return to work tomorrow.
68.449
# RAJ
69.742
Yay.
70.827
71.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
72.912
Well, why isn't everyone happy?
74.581
74.998
Your little ray of sunshine
is ready to beam again.
77.750
78.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
79.502
You really don't know why?
80.628
# SHELDON
80.962
No. But I knew that
his "yay" was sarcastic.
83.840
84.465
It was not bad for a guy whose last bowel
movement sounded like rain on a roof.
88.177
88.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
91.014
Let me refresh your memory.
92.515
93.100

# SHELDON
94.642
Penny, rub Vicks on my chest.
97.687
# PENNY
98.730
Sheldon, I cooked you breakfast.
I made your bed.
101.858
102.025
I checked your mouth for thrush.
103.693
104.700
**LOL**
105.570
You can rub your own chest.
107.030
# SHELDON
107.864
Sure, grope every other man on the planet
but draw the line with me.
111.034
112.400
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
113.953
I brought you
a little care package from work.
116.039
116.205
It's our latest anti-viral and
the best decongestant we make.
118.708
# SHELDON
119.792
I hope laughter is the best medicine,
'cause this care package is a joke.
123.880
124.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
125.298
Hey, she came all the way here--
127.098
# BERNADETTE
133.014
You're gonna wanna take these with food.
134.724
135.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
137.685
Sheldon, stop being a baby
and let Emily take a look at you.
141.564
# SHELDON
141.898
She's a dermatologist.
143.775
# EMILY
143.941
I went to medical school.
145.610
# SHELDON
146.069
Well, in that case, try removing
147.487
147.654
the irritating patch of brown skin
standing next to you.
150.907
151.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
154.619
Okay, here you go.
156.204
# SHELDON
157.538
Leonard, I'm dying.
158.831
# LEONARD
159.415
You're not dying, it's just the flu.
161.417
# SHELDON
161.584
I asked for chicken noodle, this
is chicken and stars. It's killing me.
165.588
166.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
169.550
I never did get that
chicken noodle, did I?

Hi, Sheldon.
202.062
# SHELDON
202.062
Hello.
203.000
# AMY
203.334
Are you feeling any better?
204.752
# SHELDON
205.461
Physically yes, but I'm upset because
everyone's mad at me for no good reason.
209.799
210.500
**LOL**
# AMY
212.009
Why don't you tell me what happened,
and in a gentle, loving way,
215.471
215.638
I'll explain to you why you're wrong.
217.473
218.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
219.392
Well, you know how when you're sick,
220.852
221.018
you're allowed to be cranky
and say whatever you want
223.980
224.147
and other people's feelings don't matter?
226.357
226.600
**LOL**
# AMY
228.401
Gentle and loving,
this is gonna be tricky.
231.028
231.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
232.071
I had a 101 fever.
233.948
234.115
If that's not a time to
verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?
237.577
238.400
**LOL**
# AMY
239.412
Sheldon, when you're sick
you can be unbearable.
243.791
244.834
And that's why your friends
have been known to work late,
248.045
248.212
or sneak out to the movies,
250.548
250.715
or stay at a neurobiology conference
three days after it's ended.
254.302
254.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
255.553
You stayed in Michigan all week
to avoid being around me?
258.347
# AMY
258.514
No, no, not just that. I mean...
261.601
261.768
Detroit is beautiful when it's sleeting.
264.437
265.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
266.522
You know, I'm not the only one
who's unpleasant when they're sick.
269.122
269.233
When Penny got food poisoning,
270.777
270.943
she threw up so loudly
I could barely hear the television.
273.571
274.000
**LOL**
# AMY
275.281
Oh, I just heard something.
Might be hail, might be gunfire.
278.242
278.409
Either way, I'm gonna
go take pictures. Bye!
280.703

Hey, Stuart.

# STUART
284.332
Hey.
284.957
285.708
Where's Sheldon? Still sick?
286.918
# LEONARD
287.084
No, he's fine.
We just needed a little break.
289.712
# STUART
289.879
Yeah, I get that. When I brought him
his comics the other day,
292.548
292.715
he said, "Oh, great,
death is literally at my door."
295.510
296.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
297.804
He was being a jerk to everyone,
don't take it personally.
300.473
# STUART
300.681
Oh, I'm on so many antidepressants,
I couldn't if I wanted to.
304.352
304.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
306.646
Ah, I wish we could do more stuff
without Sheldon.
309.106
# LEONARD
309.857
I wish that all the time.
311.943
311.700
**LOL**
312.109
Usually before I
blow out birthday candles.
314.904
315.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
316.489
You know, Amy took some time off from him.
319.033
319.450
And it really improved their relationship.
321.130
# RAJ
321.828
Oh, okay. As long as it doesn't end
with us having coitus with him, I'm in.
326.582
327.100
**LOL**
# HOWARD
328.251
We should all take a trip or something.
330.086
# LEONARD
330.545
You know, Penny and I have been talking
about taking a weekend in Vegas.
333.339
333.422
Maybe we should all go.
334.841
# HOWARD
335.007
Bernie would love that.
336.342
# RAJ
336.509
Oh, oh, maybe we could get one of those
party buses to take us there.
339.387
# LEONARD
339.595
That sounds really fun.
340.596
# RAJ
340.763
Yeah, that sounds fun!
A party bus party don't stop!
344.267
344.200
**LOL**
344.433
Oh, when I say "party" you say "bus!"
346.519
# LEONARD
# HOWARD
# LEONARD
346.686
No.No!
347.791
# HOWARD
347.791
No.No!
348.896
348.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
351.607
So, the guys and I were talking about
353.276
353.442
renting a party bus and
everyone going to Vegas.
355.444
# PENNY
355.611
Ooh, that could be fun.
357.196
357.363
But just to be clear, you mean a party bus
with booze and music, right?
360.533
360.700
Not like juice boxes and video games.
362.743
363.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
363.870
Yes. And Howard's birthday
was a drop-off party,
366.789
366.956
you didn't have to stay.
368.249
369.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
370.251
Oh, I'm in. When are we going?
371.356
# LEONARD
371.356
This weekend.
372.461
# SHELDON
372.628
Oh, where are we going?
374.463
# LEONARD
375.381
Well, Vegas, but
376.883
# SHELDON
377.383
Ugh, Atlantic City without the taffy?
No, thank you.
380.261
381.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
381.929
Well, that's fine, 'cause actually,
you're not invited.
383.890
# SHELDON
383.973
Well, that's hurtful.
385.725
# PENNY
386.017
Oh, Sheldon, you don't even like it there.
388.060
# SHELDON
388.227
Yeah, I can consider a place
America's urinal cake
390.646
390.813
and still enjoy the occasional visit.
393.024
393.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
394.150
Not this time.
395.276
# SHELDON
395.484
Well, fine.
Then I'll just hang out with Wolowitz.
397.778
# LEONARD
397.945
He's coming, too.
398.988
# SHELDON
399.280
Well, then Raj and I--
400.218
# LEONARD
400.218
Nope.
401.157
# SHELDON
402.033
Very well, Stuart.
403.159
# LEONARD
403.326
Oh, great! Do that.
404.702
# SHELDON
406.329
Ugh! Stuart.
407.622
407.900
**LOL**
410.249
Hi, Sheldon. What's new?
411.834
# SHELDON
412.001
Our friends are jerks and
I'm mad at all of them.
414.253
# AMY
414.503
Okay, I said, "What's new," but sure.
416.547
417.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
418.174
Can you believe they planned a trip
to Las Vegas and didn't invite me?
421.177
# AMY
421.761
Did you refuse to apologize and act like
they were stupid for being mad?
425.348
# SHELDON
427.141
You know, I liked it better
when there was still
428.643
428.726
a little mystery left in our relationship.
430.686
431.000
**LOL**
# AMY
432.104
Everyone tried to take care of you and
you were nothing but mean to them.
435.650
# SHELDON
435.816
I can't believe you're not on my side.
437.610
438.110
You know, I was on your side
when someone stole your car radio.
441.489
442.200
**LOL**
# AMY
443.366
Who else's side could you have been on?
445.868
446.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
447.036
I don't know! A music-loving hobo
with a heart of gold?
450.748
451.400
**LOL**
# AMY
452.708
Sheldon, I understand that you're upset
because you feel left out,
456.337
456.504
but I don't know why we 're even talking
about this. Just apologize to them.
460.591
# SHELDON
461.050
Fine, if that's what it takes
to go on their dumb trip.
463.511
# AMY
463.886
Maybe you could try apologizing
because you actually feel bad.
467.473
468.265
It's called empathy.
It's something you could work on.
471.018
# SHELDON
471.560
I have empathy. Now watch.
474.271
474.438
Leonard made me soup
and I was mean to him.
477.900
479.200
**LOL**
# AMY
481.195
Great.
482.279
482.446
Now try it as if
this isn't your first day as a person.
485.241
486.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
487.118
Fine. Leonard made me soup
and I was mean to him.
490.997
491.872
Hey, I felt a little something.
Wait, wait, let me try again.
495.501
494.600
**LOL**
496.085
Leonard made me soup
and I was mean to him.
499.505
499.797
I was mean to him.
501.716
502.425
He must've felt terrible.
Oh, now I feel terrible.
506.470
507.680
Neat!
508.806
509.300
**LOL**
# AMY
510.975
Glad I could help.
512.309
# SHELDON
512.476
Now let me see you feel bad for lying
514.937
515.104
and staying in Detroit
longer than you needed to.
517.273
# AMY
518.107
I feel so, so bad.
519.650
# SHELDON
521.652
Hey, we're both great at this!
523.529
523.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
527.908
Leonard, get ready for an apology.
530.119
530.453
And with the added twist of an M. Night
Shyamalan movie, I'm going to mean it.
534.623
535.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
536.500
Ah, so like every other
M. Night Shyamalan movie I've seen,
538.919
539.086
you spoil it in advance.
541.047
541.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
541.797
Hey, if you didn't know Bruce Willis
was dead the whole time, that's not on me.
544.925
546.200
**LOL**
548.179
Okay. Here it comes. You tried
to take care of me when I was sick
553.225
553.434
and I was mean to you.
555.519
555.811
There's no excuse for that,
and I'm truly sorry.
558.314
# LEONARD
560.608
Thank you, I appreciate that.
562.359
# SHELDON
562.651
And I want you to know that
that is sincere. I do feel bad.
565.780
565.946
I'm not just saying it
to be included on your trip.
567.946
# LEONARD
569.366
I appreciate that, too.
570.367
# SHELDON
570.534
Terrific. Now, all that's left
is for you to invite me to come,
573.120
573.287
me to ask, "Are you sure?"
You to say, "Absolutely."
575.998
576.165
And then me to bring it home with,
"How could I say no to that face."
579.168
579.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
580.628
You're still not coming.
581.837
# SHELDON
582.671
But I apologized and I meant it.
585.007
585.299
I know that we don't play this game
very often, but you're doing it wrong.
588.344
588.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
589.303
Sheldon, I accept your apology, but you
upset a lot of people while you were sick.
592.543
592.681
I'm not in a position
to just say you can come.
594.642
# SHELDON
596.310
Well, all right.
597.520
598.145
What if I apologize to all of them?
600.064
# LEONARD
600.356
Fine. If you apologize to everyone
602.108
602.274
and they all say it's okay,
then yes, you can come.
604.318
# SHELDON
604.735

Wow.  I'm impressed.

# SHELDON
639.061
No, no, no. Wait, I'm not done.
Allow me to underscore my sentiment
642.731
642.898
with a haunting rendition of Brenda Lee's

All you did was offer
maternal care and affection,
684.231
684.398

was rude and insensitive behavior.

Can this wait?
690.404
691.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
691.614
I'm afraid it can't. The trip is tomorrow
and I have more apologies to make.
695.492
# PENNY
695.659
Okay, fine, I accept your apology,
now get out!
697.620
# SHELDON
697.786
Wonderful. Now would you mind
holding up this shirt while I
700.186
# PENNY
700.331
Leonard!
701.498
701.600
**LOL**
705.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
705.294
You brought me my comic books
when I wasn't feeling well.
708.380
708.631
That, that was thoughtful and
I was insensitive. I'm sorry.
712.676
# STUART
713.969
Thank you, Sheldon. I appreciate that.
716.305
# SHELDON
716.805
And, now, I want you to know
that I mean it.
718.891
719.058
This isn't me just wanting to
go on the trip to Las Vegas.
721.977
723.400
**LOL**
# STUART
726.232
What trip to Las Vegas?
727.858
728.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
730.069
The one everyone's taking this weekend
on the party bus.
732.613
733.200
**LOL**
# STUART
733.906
Of course I wasn't invited.
735.658
# SHELDON
736.242
That would be my understanding.
738.118
738.400
**LOL**
741.205
On a less painful subject,
what size T-shirt do you take?
744.583
745.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
748.295
Raj, you were being a good friend
750.506
750.673
and my illness was no excuse
for my behavior.
754.385
754.677
I hope that you can accept my apology.
756.929
# RAJ
758.180
Of course I do.
759.306
# SHELDON
759.473
And Emily, I'm sorry for saying
dermatologists aren't real doctors.
764.186
764.520
And I'm sure you're tired of hearing that.
766.939
767.800
**LOL**
# EMILY
770.526
Do you honestly think I hear that a lot?
772.861
# SHELDON
773.279
Well, I would imagine
when your job is popping zits
775.364
775.531
and squirting Botox into old lady faces
777.324
# RAJ
777.491
Okay. Okay, the point is
that we accept your apology.
783.414
778.300
**LOL**
# EMILY
783.580
Look, maybe you do.
He just insulted me again.
786.417
# RAJ
786.583
Yeah, but he doesn't mean it.
788.043
# EMILY
788.210
Why are you defending him?
789.670
# SHELDON
789.837
Well, I believe I can answer that.
791.380
791.547
Uh, like me, Raj is demonstrating empathy.
794.383
794.550
Now, why don't you accept my apology,
you receive your free T-shirt...
799.888
799.400
**LOL**
800.055
I hope extra small is okay,
for some reason Wolowitz took a medium.
803.726
803.900
**LOL**
# EMILY
806.145
Well, I don't accept your apology.
808.564
# RAJ
808.731
What are you doing?
809.732
# EMILY
809.898
It's called standing up for myself.
You should try it sometime.
812.526
# RAJ
813.527
Fine, how about this?
You're making me uncomfortable
816.613
816.822
by prolonging this ridiculous fight
and I wish you'd stop.
819.700
# EMILY
820.576
You want me to stop? No problem.
822.578
# RAJ
822.870
No, come on. No, please don't leave.
824.371
# SHELDON
824.538
Point of clarification, are you still
going on the trip? Because if not
827.708
826.100
**LOL**
# EMILY
827.875
Don't worry, you're good.
829.460
# SHELDON
833.088
I caused that fight, I feel terrible.
835.257
835.591
Wait, I can do that better.
837.718
838.200
**LOL**
840.387
I caused that fight, I feel terrible.
843.057
843.390
Yeah, wow, I don't know
which one I like more.
845.768
845.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
848.103
So, was the fight really bad?
849.688
# SHELDON
849.938
Well, no. As a fight, it was excellent.
852.775
852.941
You know, she used harsh language
and slammed the door.
855.819
855.986
Although, as I say this, that might not
have been what you were asking.
859.531
859.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
860.824
You think they'll still go on the trip?
862.326
# SHELDON
862.409
All I know is after the fight
I went to Emily's to smooth
864.704
# LEONARD
864.787
They're not going on the trip.
865.705
# PENNY
865.705
No.
866.622
867.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
869.833
What is wrong with you?
871.210
# SHELDON
871.835
Look at him.
Caring about what's wrong with me.
874.838
875.005
That is some top shelf empathy.
876.799
877.400
**LOL**
878.967
Hey, well, we should start a club.
880.803
881.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
882.513
You went to Emily's to apologize
and when you left she was crying.
886.683
# SHELDON
887.434
That is true. I suppose
I should apologize again.
890.354
# ALL
890.521
ALL: No!
891.313
891.313
Stop.
892.106
892.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
893.440
Is she okay?
894.691
# RAJ
894.900
Yeah. I calmed her down but
she's not going to Vegas if he's going.
898.987
# HOWARD
899.780
Wait, that's an option?
I didn't know that was an option.
902.324
903.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
903.742
Well, that is fine, because I've decided
that I won't be joining you.
906.912
907.162
I've realized that the most genuine way
to demonstrate the remorse I feel is
911.208
911.375
to let you have this weekend
to yourselves.
913.877
# RAJ
915.212
That's very mature of you.
916.755
# SHELDON
917.089
Well, I've been on
a little trip myself recently.
919.550
919.716
Not to "Sin City" but to "sincere city."
922.761
923.900
**LOL**
924.513
Where, instead of genital warts,
926.598
926.765
the only growth you'll come back with
is personal growth.
929.351
929.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
930.978
And there's your next T-shirt.
932.729
933.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
936.733
Ooh, check out the stripper pole.
939.403
# BERNADETTE
939.653
You know what that means.
940.821
# LEONARD
941.071
That Raj will be on it
before we make it to the freeway?
943.282
# RAJ
944.533
You know it!
946.493
946.900
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
948.704
This is so cool!
949.997
# PENNY
950.205
Here's some champagne.
951.707
# LEONARD
951.915
Mmm-hmm.
952.958
953.375
Well, I would like to propose a toast.
To a well-deserved weekend
958.088
# SHELDON
958.255
A-ha!
959.256
959.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
962.593
What are you doing?
964.011
# SHELDON
964.386
My plan was to jump out at the state line,
966.930
967.097
but one of my nose plugs
fell into the toilet.
969.850
970.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
971.768
You couldn't give us just one weekend?
973.896
# STUART
974.104
I told him this was a bad idea.
976.148
976.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
979.568
What do we do, kick them off?
981.111
# PENNY
981.487
If we drop them off at a fire station,
982.863
982.946
they have to take them.
No questions asked.
984.740
985.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
986.617
Before you do,
988.452
988.702
please give me one more chance
to apologize to Emily.
991.705
# RAJ
992.080
Oh, God.
993.332
994.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
994.208
Emily, as I'm sure you know,
996.710
996.877
I'm considered an odd fellow.
999.087
1000.000
**LOL**
1000.964
But what you don't know is that
while I often say the wrong thing,
1004.718
1005.093
in my heart, I mean well.
1006.845
1007.012
I think that you are
a smart and wonderful woman.
1011.141
1011.975
And we all think that you can
do better than Koothrappali.
1015.270
1015.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
1017.022
You know, Sheldon
1018.106
# EMILY
1018.273
Shh, let him finish.
1019.525
1019.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
1020.108
So, for all the times I've offended you,
1023.153
1023.362
and all the times that I'll offend you
in the future, I'm sorry.
1028.075
# EMILY
1030.452
Thank you.
1031.662
# SHELDON
1031.870
Good. Then I'll be leaving now.
1034.790
# EMILY
1036.083
Oh, it's okay, Sheldon, come with us.
1039.086
# SHELDON
1039.836
Oh, that's very kind of you,
1042.089
1042.256
but I'm sure you'll all have a better time
without me. Let's go, Stuart.
1045.634
# STUART
1045.968
But I wanna stay.

You know, I know he's a jerk,
but I actually feel bad for him.

And now you see the problem.

Are you relieved that you and Raj

1084.673
were able to patch things up?
1086.049
# EMILY
1086.550
At the moment?

No, not really.
