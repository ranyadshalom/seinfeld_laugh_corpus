No, I'm not jealous.

Didn't like the look of the guy

At least now
you can retrieve the black box...
246.247
246.413
...from the smoldering wreckage
that was once your fantasy of dating her...
249.917
250.084
...and analyze the data so that
you don't crash into geek mountain again.
253.921

# HOWARD
255.256
I disagree. Love is not a sprint.
It's a marathon.
259.301
259.468
A relentless pursuit that only ends
when she falls into your arms...
264.431
264.598
...or hits you with the pepper spray.

I have noticed that Leslie Winkle
recently started shaving her legs.
289.123
289.290
Now, given that winter is coming,
one can assume she's signaling...

...sexual availability.

There are pitfalls.

Trust me, I know.

When it comes
to sexual-harassment law...

Howard, if I were to ask Leslie Winkle out,
it would just be for dinner.

I'm not gonna walk into the lab,
ask her to strip naked and dance for me.

Hi, Leonard.
324.199
# LEONARD

I'd like to propose an experiment--
325.429
# LESLEY
325.429
Goggles.
326.493
# LEONARD
326.660
Right.
327.953
328.000
**LOL**
330.039
I would like to propose an experiment.
331.561
# LESLEY
331.561
Hang on.
333.083
333.250
I'm trying to see how long it takes
a 500-kilowatt oxygen-iodine laser...
336.629
336.795
...to heat up my cup of noodles.
338.923
338.600

# LEONARD
340.007
I've done it.
About two seconds, 2.6 for minestrone.
342.843
343.800
**LOL**
349.600
Anyway, I was thinking more
of a biosocial exploration...
352.811
352.978
...with a neurochemical overlay.
354.855
# LESLEY
356.523
Wait, are you asking me out?
358.859
358.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
359.735
I was going to characterize it
as the modification...
362.196
362.363
...of our colleague/friendship paradigm
with the addition of a date-like component.
366.492
366.659
But we don't need to quibble
over terminology.
370.496
369.800
**LOL**
# LESLEY
370.663
What sort of experiment
would you propose?
372.539
# LEONARD
372.706
There is a generally accepted
pattern in this area.
375.250
375.417
I pick you up, take you to a restaurant,
then we would see a movie.
378.671
378.837
Probably a romantic comedy
featuring the talents...
381.173
381.340
...of Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock.
383.425
383.400
**LOL**
# LESLEY
384.051
Interesting.
385.094
385.260
And would you agree
the primary way we would evaluate...
387.846
388.013
...the success or failure of the date would
be based on the biochemical reaction...
391.892
392.059
...during the good-night kiss?
393.769
# LEONARD
393.769
Heart rate, pheromones, et cetera, yes.
395.479
395.100
**LOL**
# LESLEY
396.105
Why don't we stipulate
the date goes well...
398.107
398.273
...and move to the key variable?
400.067
# LEONARD
400.234
You mean kiss you now?
401.089
# LESLEY
401.089
Yes.
401.944
# LEONARD
402.111
Define the parameters of the kiss.
403.654
# LESLEY
403.654
Closed mouth, but romantic.
405.197
405.364
Mint?

**LOL**
# LEONARD
406.240
Thank you.

**LOL**
414.248
Shall I count down from three?
416.166
# LESLEY
416.166
No, I think it needs to be spontaneous.

417.800
**LOL**
# LESLEY
425.217
What do you think?
426.343
# LEONARD
426.343
You proposed the experiment.
427.469
427.636
I think you should present
your findings first.
430.055
# LESLEY
430.222
Fair enough.
431.765
431.932
On the plus side, it was a good kiss,
reasonable technique...
435.185
435.352
...no extraneous spittle.
436.937
437.600
**LOL**
438.230
On the other hand, no arousal.
440.441

Okay. Uh, let me ask you this.
486.820
487.196
When I learn that I'm a robot...
489.198
489.364
...would I be bound by

Oh, come on, Leonard...
665.916
667.584
This is obviously about Penny.
669.378
# LEONARD
671.672
It doesn't matter.
673.048
673.215
The woman's not interested in me.
The woman rejected me.
676.134
# SHELDON
676.301
Okay, look. Ahem.
678.679
679.346
You have as much of a chance of having
a sexual relationship with Penny...
682.849
683.016
...as the Hubble telescope does...
684.601
684.768
...of discovering
at the center of every black hole...
686.895
687.062
...is a little man with a flashlight
searching for a circuit breaker.
690.274
690.200
**LOL**
692.567
Nevertheless, I do feel obligated
to point out to you...
697.656
697.823
...that she did not reject you.
699.866
700.325
You did not ask her out.
701.952
# LEONARD
703.537
You're right.
704.913
705.330
I didn't ask her. I should ask her out.
707.165
# SHELDON
707.332
No, no. Now, that was not my point.
709.543
709.700
**LOL**
710.085
My point was, don't buy a cat.
712.921
# LEONARD
713.088
No, but you're right.
715.048
715.215
I should march over there
and ask her out.
717.426
# SHELDON
717.968
Oh, goody, we're getting a cat.
721.013
721.800
**LOL**
722.931
Oh, yeah-- No.
724.891
728.145
Oh, hey, Leonard.
729.125
# LEONARD
729.125
Good afternoon, Penny.
730.105
730.272
So, hi, hey. Uh...
732.649
732.700
**LOL**
733.775
I was wondering
if you had plans for dinner.
735.777
# PENNY
735.944
Uh, you mean, dinner tonight?
737.321
# LEONARD
738.822
There is an inherent ambiguity
in the word "dinner."
741.408
741.575
Technically,
it refers to the largest meal of the day.
744.411
744.578
Soto clarify here,
by dinner, I mean supper.
747.122
# PENNY
747.497
Supper?
748.394
# LEONARD
748.394
Or dinner, you know.
749.291
749.200
**LOL**
750.584
I was thinking 6:30 if you can go,
or a different time.
753.211
# PENNY
753.378
Uh, 6:30 is great.
754.546
# LEONARD
754.713
Really?
756.173
756.400
**LOL**
758.091
Great.
759.197
# PENNY
759.197
Yeah, I like hanging outwith you guys.
760.302
# LEONARD
760.469
Us guys?
761.511
# PENNY
761.678
Oh, you know, Sheldon, Howard, Raj.
Who all is coming?
764.556
# LEONARD
765.599
They...
767.017
767.851
...might all be there.
770.145
770.000
**LOL**
771.271
Or a subset of them might be there.
773.982
774.149
Algebraically speaking,
there are too many unknowns.
776.443
776.610
For example,
Sheldon had Quizno's for lunch.
778.612
778.779
Sometimes he finds that filling,
other times he doesn't.
781.323
781.490
It's no fault of Quizno's.
They have a varied menu.
784.785
784.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
786.286
Okay, whatever, it sounds like fun.
787.996
# LEONARD
788.747
Great.
790.123
790.290
Did we say a time?
791.041
# PENNY
791.041
Six-thirty.
791.792
# LEONARD
791.958
Still good?
793.001
# PENNY
793.168
It's fine.
793.981
# LEONARD
793.981
It's not carved in stone.
794.795
# PENNY
794.961
No. Six-thirty is great.
796.254
# LEONARD
796.421
I'll get my chisel. Heh-heh.
798.507
798.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
799.549
Why?
801.218
# LEONARD
803.178
To carve the--
Okay, I'll see you at 6:30.
807.307
806.800
**LOL**
814.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
817.943
How do I look?
819.778
821.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
824.199
Could you be more specific?
826.034
826.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
827.744
Can you tell I'm perspiring a little?
830.163
# SHELDON
830.997
No. The dark crescent-shaped patterns
under your arms conceal it nicely.
835.419
836.000
**LOL**
837.671
What time is your date?
838.568
# LEONARD
838.568
Six-thirty.
839.464
# SHELDON
839.673
Perfect, that gives you
two hours and 15 minutes...
842.008
842.175
...for that dense molecular cloud
of Aramis to dissipate.
845.387
845.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
846.346
Is it too much?
848.035
# SHELDON
848.035
Not if you're a rugby team.
849.724
849.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
851.393
By the way, you didn't join us
because you stuffed yourself...
854.354
854.521
...with a chicken-carbonara sub
at Quizno's.
856.731
856.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
857.190
Why would I join you?
858.316
# LEONARD
859.317
No reason.
860.819
860.700
**LOL**
863.196
Oh, you know what?
Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
865.657
# SHELDON
865.824
Oh, no, well, now,
there's always the possibility...
868.201
868.368
...that alcohol and poor judgment
on her part...
870.579
870.745
...might lead to a nice romantic evening.
873.123
873.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
874.666
You're right. Alcohol, poor judgment.
It could go well.
877.919
877.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
878.545
Of course, there's the other possibility
that this day kicks off...
881.590
881.756
...an unpleasant six months of you
passing awkwardly in the hall...
884.843
885.010
...until one of you breaks down
and moves to another zip code.
887.888
887.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
888.305
You could have stopped at,
"It could go well."
891.349
# SHELDON
891.933
If I could have, I would have.
893.977
893.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
894.394
I mean, I'm a perfectly nice guy.
There's no reason...
896.980
897.147
...we couldn't go to the restaurant
and have a lovely dinner.
899.941
900.108
Maybe take a walk afterwards,
talk about things we have in common.
904.738
904.905
"You love pottery? I love pottery."
907.741
908.158
You know, there's a pause.
We both know what's happening.
910.785
908.800
**LOL**
910.952
We kiss. It's a little tentative at first.
912.913
913.079
But I realize, she's kissing me back,
she's biting my lower lip.
916.082
916.249
She wants me.
This thing is going the distance.
918.418
918.585
We're gonna have sex.
Oh, God. Oh, my God.
920.587
920.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
923.298
Is the sex starting now?
925.926
925.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
926.593
I'm having a panic attack.
927.969
# SHELDON
928.136
Oh, okay. Well, then, calm down.
931.473
931.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
931.640
If I could,
I wouldn't be having an attack.
933.517
933.683
That's why they call it a panic attack.
934.892
935.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
934.892
All right.
936.102
936.269
Would you just sit down?
937.812
937.979
Yeah, sit down. Now close your eyes.
939.272
# LEONARD
939.272
Why?
940.565
# SHELDON
940.732
Just do it.
941.337
# LEONARD
941.337
Okay.
941.942
# SHELDON
942.108
Now, try to increase
your alpha-wave activity.
945.111
# LEONARD
945.278
What?
946.654
946.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
946.654
It's a biofeedback technique.
948.031
948.198
It's relaxation
through brainwave manipulation.
950.325
950.492
I read it
in the Journal of American Neuroscience.
952.661
952.827
It was sparsely sourced,
but I think the science is valid.
955.539
955.705
I probably have it here somewhere.
958.291
957.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
958.458
Who am I kidding?
I can't go through with this.
960.585
960.752
You need to call her and cancel.
961.607
# SHELDON
961.607
Me?
962.462
# LEONARD
962.629
Yes.
963.400
# SHELDON
963.400
What should I tell her?
964.172
# LEONARD
964.339
I don't know. Tell her I'm sick.
965.549
# SHELDON
965.549
Okay.
966.758
# LEONARD
966.925
Not the kind that would make her
wanna take care of me.
969.469
969.636
But nothing so critical that she'll feel
uncomfortable if I wanna try this again.
973.848
# SHELDON
974.015
Got it. So I'm assuming nothing venereal.
976.518
977.300
**LOL**
981.189
I'll just tell her that you had
a routine colonoscopy...
983.775
983.942
...and haven't quite bounced back.
985.777
985.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
985.944
Give me the phone.
987.132
# SHELDON
987.132
I thought you wanted to cancel.
988.321
# LEONARD
988.488
I can't. If I don't show up,
she'll still be expecting you.
991.324
# SHELDON
991.992
Why would she be expecting me?
993.868
# LEONARD
994.869
Stop asking me all these questions.
I need to take another shower.
998.915
998.400

# PENNY

Are the rest of the guys meeting us here?

1005.005
No.
1006.339
1006.200
**LOL**
1006.923
Turns out that Raj and Howard
had to work...
1008.925
1009.092
...and Sheldon had a colonoscopy,
and he hasn't quite bounced back yet.
1014.556
1014.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
1015.515
Ooh, my uncle just had
a colonoscopy.
1017.809
# LEONARD
1017.976
You're kidding. Well, then,
that's something we have in common.
1022.063
1022.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
1022.606
How?
1024.316
# LEONARD
1024.482
We both have people in our lives
who wanna nip intestinal polyps in the bud.
1030.989
1031.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
1036.870
So, what's new in the world of physics?
1038.955

1040.040
Nothing.
1041.625
1041.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
1042.542
Really? Nothing?
1044.044
# LEONARD
1044.210
Well, with the exception of string theory,
not much has happened since the 1930s...
1049.716
1049.883
...and you can't prove string theory.
1051.593
1051.760
At best you can say, "Hey, look, my idea
has an internal logical consistency."
1057.223
1057.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
1058.350
Ah. Well, I'm sure things will pick up.
1062.020

# LEONARD
1066.107
What's new at the Cheesecake Factory?
1068.109
# PENNY
1068.276
Oh, uh, not much.
1070.737
1070.904
Oh, we do have a chocolate key lime
that's moving pretty well.
1075.283

1075.450
Good.

your, uh, hallway friend?
1086.002

Doug? Oh, yeah. I don't know. I mean,
you know, he's nice and funny, but
1090.590
# WAITRESS
1090.757
Can I get you started with some drinks?
1091.883
# LEONARD
1091.883
No. Bzzz.
1093.009
1093.700
**LOL**
1094.260
You were saying, "But..."?
1095.345
# PENNY
1095.345
I'd like a drink.
1096.429
# LEONARD
1096.596
Just say the "but" thing about Doug,
and then I'll get her back.
1099.849
1099.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
1100.433
Okay, well, it--
I don't know. It's just me.
1103.269
1103.436
I'm still getting over this break-up
with Kurt.
1105.605
1105.772
And this thing with Doug
would just be rebound sex.
1108.608

Ugh. Don't get me started
on rebound sex.
1113.363

It's just-- It's my pattern.
1115.198
1115.365
I break up, then I find some cute guy...
1117.575
1117.742
...and then it's just
36 meaningless hours of...
1121.454
1121.621
Well, you know.
1122.872
# LEONARD
1124.916
I'm not sure that I do. Um...
1126.334
1126.500
**LOL**
1127.669
ls that one 36-hour experience
or is that 36 hours spread out over...
1132.507
1132.674
...say, one glorious summer?
1136.136
1136.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
1136.302
No. It's usually over a weekend.
1137.804
1137.971
And trust me,
you do not feel good after it.
1140.724
# LEONARD
1141.099
Well, chafing, right?
1143.309
1142.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
1144.477
Emotionally.
1145.562

Of course, yeah. Emotional chafing.

1155.697
Hey, do you wanna see something cool?
1157.866
1159.284
I can make this olive go into this glass
without touching it.
1163.496
# PENNY
1163.747
How?
1165.061
# LEONARD
1165.061
Physics.
1166.374
1166.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
1171.671
Wow, centrifugal force.
1173.882
# LEONARD
1174.048
Actually, it's centripetal force,
which is an inward force...
1177.343
1177.510
...generated by the glass
acting on the olive. Ooh.
1180.847
1181.681
Excuse me.
1182.932
1183.099
Now, if you were biting on the olive...
1186.227
1186.394
...you'd be in a non-inertial
reference frame and would
1189.939

Are you okay?
1192.942

No, no. I'm okay.
1205.455
1205.622
It stopped bleeding.
1207.040

Anyway, you did throw up.
Isn't that a sign of a concussion?

This was just you and me hanging out
with guys who didn't show up...
