Sheldon, did you just figure out
5.929
6.095
a method for synthesizing
a new stable super-heavy element?
9.307
9.474
Did I?
11.017
10.800
**LOL**
11.184
Well, that can't be right.
12.268
12.435
No one's ever done that before.
13.978
14.145
Except me because I just did it!
15.772

19.651
19.817
I've made a horrible mistake.
22.028
22.487
What are you talking about?
23.196
23.279
This table,
it's in square centimeters.
25.865
26.032
I read it as square meters.
27.909
28.076
You know what that means?
29.327
29.494
That Americans can't handle
the metric system?
31.704
32.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
33.957
Amy, I was off by a factor of 10,000.
37.377
37.544
But the Chinese team
found the element.
39.796
39.963
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have.
41.131
41.214
My calculations were wrong.
42.715
42.882
The greatest scientific
achievement of my life
44.682
44.842
is based on a blunder.
46.427
46.594
I'm not a genius.
47.720
47.887
I'm a fraud.
49.055
49.700
**LOL**
49.931
You know, Sheldon, in neuroscience,
51.308
51.391
we're forever finding something
in one part of the brain
53.935
54.102
that we thought was
someplace else.
55.462
55.562
Oh, great,
now I'm worse than a fraud.
58.106
58.815
I'm practically a biologist.

This is Science Friday.
I'm Ira Flatow.
65.363
65.530
My guest today is responsible
for the discovery of the first

# IRA
68.866
stable super-heavy element.
71.327
71.494
Welcome, Dr. Sheldon Cooper.
72.829
72.996
Thank you.
73.830
75.331
The university made me come here.
76.458
76.541
I didn't want to.
77.542
79.544
Big fan of the show.
81.504
81.200
**LOL**
82.630
So, I understand
that you actually discovered
85.049
85.133
this element by mistake.
86.551
# SHELDON
88.803
Yes.
90.471
89.800
**LOL**
# IRA
91.014
And some people in the science
community are calling it
93.516
93.683
"The Wonder Blunder."
95.518
# SHELDON
95.685
Who?
Give me their names.
97.186
97.353
I bet it's Wolowitz.
98.771
99.000
**LOL**
# IRA
99.731
It's just such a fascinating story.
101.441
101.608
Your calculations are way off,
102.984
103.151
but they find the element anyway.
105.361
105.528
It's like misreading
a treasure map
107.697
107.864
and still finding the treasure.
110.074
# SHELDON
110.241
Can we talk
about something else?
112.076
112.243
Do you know that I yodel?
114.495
115.100
**LOL**
# IRA
117.206
That's interesting,
but this could be taking you
118.833
118.916
down the path
toward a Nobel Prize.
121.169
121.336
And in Chemistry, no less.
122.545
122.712
And wouldn't that be unusual?
124.714
124.881
Because you're a physicist.
127.050
# SHELDON
127.216
Yes, yes, I'd be a physicist
with a Nobel in Chemistry.
129.376
129.510
Everyone laugh at the circus freak.
131.346
131.500
**LOL**
132.972
I don't need to sit
here and take this, Flatow.
135.350
136.184
It is because of bullies like you,
137.727
137.894
every day more and more Americans
139.395
139.562
are making the switch to television.

President Seibert, I don't
know why you're yelling.
170.843
171.010
You're the one who
made me go on the radio.
173.221
173.388
I was expecting a professional
science interview,
176.057
176.224
not an attack by some
morning zoo shock jock.
179.560
179.800
**LOL**
181.521
Well, if the university
needs money so badly,
183.281
183.439
perhaps you should
start a swear jar.
185.483
185.800

Whoa! That one's worth a dollar.

# AMY

I know you don't like it,
193.116
193.282
but every time
you do an interview,
194.534
194.617
it raises the profile
of the university.
196.452
196.619
That translates to funding.
198.121
# SHELDON
198.287
Yeah, well, I'm not just
199.205
199.288
some trained monkey
dancing for coins.

Of course you're not.

215.388
Look, you're going to be
doing this stuff for a while.
217.140

You're just going to have to find
a way to get used to it.
219.504
# SHELDON
219.600
But none of you know
what this is like.

# WIL
300.389
Amy said you were
having a rough time,
301.891
302.058
and I thought maybe we could talk.
303.184
303.267
Is that okay?
304.560
# SHELDON
304.811
Certainly.
306.437
306.604
Although... right now,
I'm having a rough time
308.398
308.481
because there's
three people in my room,
310.733
310.900
and it's starting to feel
like a discotheque.
312.660

# AMY
314.320
Sheldon, you said you were
unhappy getting attention
316.364
316.531
for something you wished
you never did.

# WIL
318.783
Yeah, I know a little
something about that.
320.463

are not that bad.

331.212
331.295
about when I was a kid on Star Trek.

333.798
How could you not
like getting attention
335.258
335.341
for playing Wesley Crusher?
336.676
336.843
You were wonderful.
338.761
338.928
A know-it-all boy genius
with an eidetic memory.
342.348
342.515
Who couldn't relate to that?
344.267
345.100
**LOL**
# WIL
345.434
Well, not everybody felt that way.
347.061
347.228
A lot of people
really hated the character,
348.855
348.938
and some of them
hated me because of it.
351.065
351.232
I would do interviews,
352.108
352.191
and people would be mean to me.
353.693

out of Wesley Crusher's shadow.
385.534
386.017
But now, it's just one small part

I've been re-running the tests
on your element in my lab
557.855

and I disproved it.

They found it.

# LEONARD
565.738
Yeah, it turns out someone added
simulated signals to the data files.

Really?

Yes!
Do you know what that means?

It means that all of this
attention that you hate goes away.
576.916
# SHELDON
577.083
So no more interviews?
578.021
# LEONARD
578.021
No, it's all over.
578.959
# SHELDON
579.126
I can't believe it.
580.023
# LEONARD
580.023
Well, you're welcome.
580.920
# SHELDON
581.087
You robbed me
of my greatest achievement!
583.297
583.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
585.508
What?!
586.300
# SHELDON
586.467
I'm back down to nine friends!
588.052
588.600
**LOL**
589.261
Make it eight.
I'm sick of Wolowitz, too!
591.347
591.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
592.681
I don't understand.
595.017
595.184
All you've done since you discovered
this stupid element was complain.
598.062
598.229
I was trying to make you happy!
599.469
# SHELDON
599.563
By taking away
my only claim to fame?
602.024
602.191
Well, if you wanted
to make me happy,
603.692
603.859
you could have told me a joke.
605.111
605.277
Or shown me a cute video
of a koala and an otter
608.447
608.614
becoming unlikely friends.
609.949
609.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
611.075
There is no winning with you.
613.369
613.536
And koalas and otters
don't even live near each other!
615.746
# SHELDON
615.871
That's what makes
their friendship unlikely!
618.165
617.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
618.874
Hey!
What's with all the yelling?
621.252
# SHELDON
621.836
Leonard disproved my element.
623.212
623.379
Now all the attention
is going to go away.
626.090
# PENNY
626.257
Oh, that's great.
You must be thrilled!
627.675
# SHELDON
627.758
That's it!
I'm down to seven friends.
630.219
630.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
632.179
He's counting Hobbits
and superheroes, right?
634.515
634.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
634.890
When I thought the element was real,
I didn't want it.
637.977
638.144
But now that Leonard
made it not exist,
639.812
639.979
I want it more
than anything in the world.
641.647
# LEONARD
641.897
The element
never existed.
643.899
644.066
I didn't take it away,
science took it away.
645.777
645.860
Be mad at science.
646.777
# SHELDON
646.944
Don't you dare use
science against me.
648.988
649.500
**LOL**
649.947
Science is my best friend!
652.074
652.241
Oh, good,
I'm back up to eight.
653.951
653.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
655.327
Will you tell him
he's out of his mind.
657.413
# PENNY
657.580
Actually, I get what he's saying.
658.664
# SHELDON
658.747
Yes! Nine!
659.707
659.790
Welcome back, buddy.
661.250
661.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
663.544
It's like if you're dating
someone you're not that into,
665.505
665.588
and then they break up with you
666.756
666.839
and then you want them
more than ever.
668.174
# SHELDON
668.257
I have no idea what
she's talking about.
669.817
669.925
But we're ganging up on you
so I agree.
672.428
672.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
673.888
Okay, Sheldon, what do you
want me to do,
675.931
676.098
hide the information?
677.266
677.433
If I don't publish it,
it's just a matter of time
679.060
679.143
before someone else does.
680.144
# SHELDON
680.311
No, no, of course
you have to publish.
681.937
682.104
That's your responsibility
as a scientist.
683.856
684.023
Doing otherwise
would be unethical.
685.524
685.691
You have no choice.
686.775
# LEONARD
687.484
Fine, I'll publish.
688.569
# SHELDON
688.736
Can you believe this guy?
690.029
690.300
**LOL**
695.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
696.535
Oh, Raj did the dishes.
698.370
# HOWARD
698.537
How do you know
I didn't do them?
699.955
# BERNADETTE
700.122
Because once,
when all the knives were dirty,
701.749
701.832
you cut a bagel with your keys.
703.626
704.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
706.128
Good morning, everybody.
707.796
707.963
I picked up coffee
while I was out.
709.924
710.090
Bernadette,
here's your soy peppermint mocha.
712.509
# BERNADETTE
712.676
You didn't have to do that.
714.678
# RAJ
714.845
Oh, my pleasure, and don't worry
715.888
715.971
about your presentation today.
717.014
717.097
You're going to be great.
718.140
# HOWARD
718.307
Yeah, you're going to
knock it out of the park.
720.309
# BERNADETTE
720.476
What presentation do I have today?
722.436
# HOWARD
724.146
Just go.
725.397
726.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
729.485
He loves you.
730.819
731.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
731.278
What are you doing?
732.279
732.363
Are you trying
to make me look bad?
733.614
# RAJ
733.697
I'm just being
a good house guest.
735.074
# HOWARD
735.241
No, you're being
a better husband than I am.
736.617
736.700
Doing the dishes,
getting coffee,
738.285
738.452
knowing about her life?
739.495
739.662
Who does that?
740.913
741.100
**LOL**
# RAJ
742.373
Oh, come on,
I brought you one, too.
744.041
# HOWARD
744.208
I don't want coffee.
745.709
# RAJ
745.876
That's why I got you
hot chocolate.
747.236
# HOWARD
747.336
Give me that.
749.296
749.100
**LOL**
749.463
Just stop showing me up.
752.007
# RAJ
752.174
Howard, listen to me.
753.509
753.676
You're a great husband.
754.927
755.094
Yes, your listening skills
could use some work.
757.513
757.680
But it's amazing
how far you've come
760.140
760.266
given that you're an only child
raised by an over-protective mom.
764.186
# HOWARD
765.396
Is this getting weird?
766.855
# RAJ
767.022
Hang on.
768.023
770.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
772.528
Oh, yes.
774.196
774.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
776.365
Hey.
778.450
778.701
I just wanted to let you know
that I posted my findings.
780.911
# SHELDON
781.078
I saw.
782.162
782.329
And I just posted
a retraction of my paper.
785.582
785.749
Now the whole scientific community
knows I was wrong.
788.585
# LEONARD
788.752
These things happen
all the time, Sheldon.
791.255
# SHELDON
791.422
Not to me.
792.423
792.589
The only other retraction
I ever had to issue
794.550
794.717
was when I was seven
and I conceded that my brother
797.219
797.386
was the greatest ninja
in East Texas.
799.722
800.300
**LOL**
801.348
But that was just a ploy
to get my face out of his armpit.
803.976
804.400
**LOL**
# BARRY
805.436
There he is!
807.229

It's my favorite superhero,

the Retractor!
811.900
811.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
813.902
Come on,
don't give him a hard time.
816.405
# BARRY
816.572
I'm sorry, Cooper.
817.698
817.865
I retract it.
819.408
819.900
**LOL**
820.993
By the way, Hofstadter,
822.661
822.828
nice job disproving
the Chinese team.
825.205
# LEONARD
825.372
It's not a big deal.
826.290
# BARRY
826.457
It's a huge deal.
827.916
828.083
Cooper, maybe physics
just isn't your thing.
830.711
829.900
**LOL**
831.545
Have you ever considered
a career in retail?
833.756
833.922
That way you could take
things back for a living.
836.717
837.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
838.344
Okay, Barry, that's enough.
839.553
# SHELDON
839.720
Oh, no, that's okay.
840.929
841.096
I can fight my own battles.
842.931
843.098
Isn't that right, "Bawwy"?
845.768
846.400
**LOL**
# BARRY
848.312
Is...?
849.480
849.646
Is that a reference
to my speech impediment?
852.232
853.692
That's pretty hurtful.
856.111
856.278
.111
857.529
857.696
I can't control it.
859.698
# SHELDON
861.158
You're right,
862.076
862.242
that was uncalled for.
864.119
864.286
I take it back.
865.537
# BARRY
865.704
Of course you do.
866.497
866.663
Because you're the Retractor!

# BERNADETTE
873.045
Raj, this dinner was amazing.
875.047
875.214
If you're here much longer,
876.257
876.340
I'm going to have
to buy bigger clothes.
878.175
878.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
878.342
Nonsense.
879.176
879.343
You need a little fattening up.
880.428
880.511
You've been looking
too skinny lately.
882.221
882.700
**LOL**
882.429
Aww.
883.722
# BERNADETTE
883.847
Howie, how come you never
say anything sweet like that?
886.225
# HOWARD
886.392
What are you talking about?
887.268
887.351
Remember last week,
when I asked you
888.519
888.602
if you were wearing Spanx
and you weren't?
889.895
889.978
How's that different?
891.688
892.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
893.774
Maybe you could try being
more thoughtful,
895.192
895.275
like your friend Raj.
896.693
# HOWARD
896.860
Yeah, well, maybe you could
try being more like Raj.
899.238
# BERNADETTE
899.405
Oh, really?
900.322
# HOWARD
900.322
Yeah, yeah.
901.240
901.407
He packed me
a lunch this morning.
902.727
902.825
And there was a note inside
that said, "Go get them."
905.869
906.000
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
906.870
Like I don't do enough around here.
908.455
908.622
Now I need to pack your lunch?
909.822
909.915
And by the way, why do you need
a note telling you
911.500
911.583
to go get them?
You're a grown man!
912.752
912.835
You should know to "go get them!"
914.155
914.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
915.254
I do know to "go get them,"
916.505
916.672
but sometimes
it's nice to have emotional support
918.257
918.340
when I'm going and getting them!
920.342
920.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
920.384
Hey, hey, do you hear yourselves?
923.011
923.178
Let's just, you know, all calm down
and take a step back.
926.348
# BERNADETTE
927.891
This is stupid.
Why are we fighting?
929.643
# HOWARD
929.810
I don't know.
930.686
930.853
I guess I was just feeling
like I'm a lousy husband.
933.981
# BERNADETTE
934.148
You're not a lousy husband.
935.482
935.649
You're a great husband.
936.775
936.942
I was the one feeling
like a lousy wife.
939.027
# HOWARD
939.194
Are you kidding?
You're the best.
941.280
941.447
I know what the problem is.
942.823
942.990
It's him!
944.199
944.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
945.492
Oh, What did I do?
947.453
# HOWARD
947.619
You made us feel like
we're not trying hard enough.
949.497
# BERNADETTE
949.580
Yeah, we were totally fine
half-assing our marriage
951.580
951.665
till you showed up.
953.375
953.300
**LOL**
# RAJ
953.542
Look, I'm sorry
you're upset with me,
956.086
956.253
but I just have to say
it's nice to see
957.796
957.963
the two of you on the same page.
959.339
959.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
959.506
Oh, it does feel good
961.008
961.175
to have you backing me up for once.
962.593
# BERNADETTE
962.759
I back you up all the time!
963.843
# HOWARD
963.843
That is not
964.928
965.095
He's doing it again!
966.055

What is wrong with you?!

# LEONARD
969.057
I can't believe they kicked you out.
970.559

970.726
I can't believe
they're still married.
972.561
973.000
**LOL**
974.396
Oh, no, I forgot Cinnamon's
toothbrush at Howard's.
977.733

It probably Won't.

**LOL**
# RAJ
1016.271
Sheldon, I think
you might find the support
1018.732
1018.899
you're looking for, if you realize
1020.275
1020.442
that relationships
are a give and take.
1022.528
1022.694
She can only be there for you
1023.946
1024.112
as much as you are for her.
1025.864
# AMY
1026.031
Thank you, Rajesh.
1027.658
# RAJ
1027.824
And, Amy, you need
to be patient with Sheldon,
1029.952
1030.118
instead of pressuring him
to accept intimacy on your terms.
1033.121

I'm Ira Flatow,

1044.841
I'd like to welcome back
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,
1046.802
1046.969
who thought
he had discovered
1048.887
1049.054
a new super-heavy element
only to have it disproved
1051.640
1051.807
by my next guest,
Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
1054.101
1054.268
Welcome to Science Friday,

Ira, if I may, I'd like to apologize
for my behavior last week.

# IRA
1061.525
It's all right.

No.

Now, Dr. Hofstadter.
1071.827
1071.994
Can you walk us
through the process
1073.245
1073.328
you used to disprove his theory?

You're telling it wrong.

He was bitten by his neighbor's dog,
1095.225
1095.392
leading to his first
scientific breakthrough,
1097.152
1097.311
the doggie death-ray.

Which, sadly, he couldn't build

You know, I'd really like
to hear it from Dr. Hofstadter,
1107.404

What a surprise.
1110.657

Did you invite me back

Actually, I didn't invite you.
1115.203

You came in, you took a seat,
1116.705
1116.872
and I'm not comfortable
with confrontation.

Well, that seems
like a snooze.

You know,
if we did a shot every time
