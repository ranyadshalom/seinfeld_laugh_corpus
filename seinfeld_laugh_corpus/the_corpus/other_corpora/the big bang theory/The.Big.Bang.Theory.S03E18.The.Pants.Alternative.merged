Okay, in Avatar
when they have sex on Pandora...
5.965
6.132
...they hook up their ponytails.
7.675
7.842
So we know their ponytails
are like their junk.
11.304
10.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
11.470
Yeah. So?
12.972
# RAJ
13.139
When they ride horses
and fly on birds...
15.099
15.266
...they also use their ponytails.
16.517
# HOWARD
16.517
Your point?
17.768
# RAJ
17.935
My point is if I were a horse or a bird I'd
be very nervous around James Cameron.
22.148
22.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
23.649
It amazes me how you constantly
obsess over fictional details...
27.612
27.778
...when there are important things
in the world to worry about.
30.781
30.948
For example, why wasn't William
Shatner in the new Star Trek movie?
34.452
34.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
35.077
Hey, Sheldon,
I was up in the administration office...
37.663
37.830
...and I happened to overhear
the name of the winner...
40.458
40.625
...of the
Chancellor's Award for Science.
42.585
# SHELDON
42.752
You wanna rub my nose in the fact my
contributions are being overlooked again?
46.505
43.600
**LOL**
46.672
I am the William Shatner
of theoretical physics.
49.050
50.200
**LOL**
50.134
All right, I'll play.
51.177
51.344
What self-important preening fraud
are they honoring this year?
54.847
# LEONARD
55.014
Oh, I'm so glad you asked it like that.
You.
57.183
57.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
59.852
I won?
60.603
# LEONARD
60.603
You won.
61.354
# SHELDON
62.355
I won.
64.065
63.800
**LOL**
64.231
This is astonishing.
65.483
65.650
Not that I won the award.
No one deserves it more.
68.194
68.700
**LOL**
68.361
Actually, I guess I misspoke.
It's not astonishing.
70.821
70.988
It's more like inevitable.
72.782
72.600
**LOL**
73.366
Not sure what to do.
Maybe call my mother.
75.409
75.576
Wait. I'm gonna conduct
an interview with myself...
78.120
78.287
...and post it online.
79.330
79.800
**LOL**
# RAJ
83.501
Well, good for him.
84.835
# HOWARD
85.002
Yeah, the one thing
the William Shatner...
87.004
87.171
...of theoretical physics needed
was an ego boost.

Oh. That will be another

Oh, Chancellor Morton,
how are you, sir?
161.370
163.000
**LOL**
163.581
Yes, I was expecting your call.
Three years ago.
166.876
167.100
**LOL**
168.419
I see.
169.879
170.045
What happens if
I choose not to give a speech?
172.214
173.174
Uh-huh. And if I don't want to forfeit
the award?
176.552
177.887
Well, you've got that tied up
in a neat little bow.
180.389
179.700
**LOL**
180.556
All right, thank you.
183.392

Problem.
185.060
# LEONARD
185.060
What?
186.103
# SHELDON
186.812
They expect me to give a speech
at the banquet.
189.106
189.315
I can't give a speech.
190.566
# HOWARD
190.733
Well, no, you're mistaken.
You give speeches all the time.
195.237
194.800

197.364
What you can't do is shut up.
200.576
200.500
**LOL**
# RAJ
201.577
Yeah, before the movie,
you did 20 minutes...
203.621
203.829
...on why guacamole turns brown.
206.248
206.624
Turned brown
while you were talking.
209.084
208.600
**LOL**
# SHELDON
209.710
I'm perfectly comfortable speaking
to small groups.
212.254
212.421
I cannot speak to large crowds.
214.548
# LEONARD
214.715
What to you is a large crowd?
216.091
# SHELDON
216.258
Any group big enough
to trample me to death.
218.427
218.800
**LOL**
219.595
General rule of thumb is 36 adults
or 70 children.

# PENNY
224.600
Sheldon. Congratulations.
227.061
227.228
Brought you cheesecake from work.
228.896
229.063
You know, because of your award,
not because that busboy sneezed on it.
233.108
232.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
235.361
I'm not accepting the award.
236.633

Turns out the great Sheldon Cooper

# PENNY
241.283
That's no reason to back out.
242.785
242.952
I once got a pretty big
honor in high school.
245.120
245.287
I was terrified about appearing
in front of a big crowd...
248.082
248.249
...but I went through with it.
You know?
250.251
250.417
The world looked pretty darn good
sitting on a haystack...
253.254
253.420
...in the back of a Ford F-150 as a
member of the corn queen's court.
257.675
258.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
260.010
Thank you. I'll bear that in mind...
261.846
262.012
...if I'm ever nominated
for the Hillbilly Peace Prize.

Let me tell you a story.
271.981

Where's 70 children
when you need them?
275.317
274.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
275.484
I was 14 and graduating
summa cum laude from college.
280.656
280.823
"Summa cum laude" is Latin
for "with highest honors."
283.826
# PENNY
283.993
I just love how you always skip over
the part where no one asks.
287.997

**LOL**
# SHELDON
288.163
I was Valedictorian
and expected to give an address.
291.166
291.333
Even now I can remember
that moment...
293.168
293.335
...when I walked up to the podium
and looked out at the crowd.
296.338
296.505
There must have been
thousands of people.
298.465
298.632
My heart started pounding
in my chest.
300.718
300.926
I began to hyperventilate.
302.219
302.428
My vision became blurry,
and before I knew it
305.806
305.973
Oh, dear.

# SHELDON
316.567
Come on, Mother, you know
why I can't accept the award.
320.487
320.654
With all due respect,
I don't think praying will help.
324.366
324.100
**LOL**
325.242
No, I have not heard the song
"Jesus, Take the Wheel."
329.204
328.800
**LOL**
329.371
No, no, no.
You don't need to start singing it.
332.875
333.042
Yes, I'll buy it on "the iTunes,"

Okay. Your problem is
you're trying to do this all by yourself.
373.791
# LEONARD
373.999
We could help you.
We can be your team.
375.918
376.085
Like Professor Xavier

I don't know. If you're my X-Men,
what are your powers?

# PENNY
400.734
Okay, well, I'm gonna take you
shopping, get you a nice suit.
403.988
404.154
Might give you more confidence.
405.655
# SHELDON
405.655
It's not exactly a mutation...
407.157
407.324
...that would get you into Xavier's
School for Gifted Youngsters...

# LEONARD
412.413
I thought I could try to analyze you

416.333
# SHELDON
416.542
What qualifies you to attempt
to understand my mind?
419.670
# LEONARD
419.837
My mother is a highly regarded
psychiatrist...
422.297
422.464
...and I've been in therapy
ever since...
424.466
424.633

of breast feeding co-dependently.

Go ahead, Howard. Dazzle me.

So, what do you say, Sheldon?
Are we your X-Men?
474.183
# SHELDON
474.349
No. The X-Men were named
for the X in Charles Xavier.

496.997
497.164
...I'm going to be leading you through
a series of meditation exercises.
500.667
500.834
These methods come
from the ancient gurus of India...
503.670

...and have helped me
overcome my own fears.
507.007
506.800

And yet you can't speak to women.

512.346
But thanks to meditation...

"Close your eyes,
you'll get a surprise."

531.240
And then she'd punch me.

I'm not going to punch you.

Yeah. Whatever.
Just go buy a sweater.

855.355
You just going to try to recycle Adler's
doctrine of the inferiority complex?
859.151

I could probably get that
from the woman at Ralph's.
862.070

But it could be part of your problem.
Let me give you an example.
869.077
869.244
When I was 8, I won a ribbon
at the science fair for my project...
873.874
874.040
...Do Lima Beans Grow Better
to Classical Music.
877.085
877.252
But my mother pointed out
that it was just a rehash...
880.213
880.380
...of my brother's earlier...
881.756
881.923
...Do Lima Beans Grow Worse
to Rock 'n' Roll.
884.634
885.000
**LOL**
886.511
I felt so guilty
I gave the ribbon back.

And how did that make you feel?

**LOL**
# LEONARD
893.185
Terrible.
894.895
895.061
I worked really hard on that project.
897.522
897.689
I stayed up all night singing
the clown's aria from Pagliacci...
900.775
900.942

# LEONARD
908.033
It wasn't my fault.
909.618
909.784
I had never seen
my brother's project.
911.745
911.912
And my mother could've told me
before...
913.955
914.164
...instead of at the ceremony
in front of everyone.
917.876
917.400

But before I do,
I'd like to share with you a letter...
974.182
974.349
...from Sheldon's mother,
who couldn't be here tonight.
977.519
977.686
Isn't that nice?

But my mother didn't hear me.

If you look at the relationship
between nurturing and growth...

is 8 inches taller than me.

All right, people,
let's get down to the math.
1211.711
1211.878
It is only three-dimensional thinking
that limits our imagination.
1216.132
1216.299
Can I take my pants off
over my head?
1218.676
1219.469
Of course not,
my body's in the way.
1222.931
1223.097
But if we had access
to higher dimensions...
1228.686

...we could move our pants
around our bodies...

1232.565
