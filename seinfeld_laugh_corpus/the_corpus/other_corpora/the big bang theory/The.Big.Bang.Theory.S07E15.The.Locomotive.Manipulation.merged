Time's running out on this.
You need to make a decision.

# SHELDON
10.058
I submitted you a notarized list.

# AMY

I'm sorry, but "Gollum"
and "Flakey" are not acceptable.
15.897
16.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
16.481
Well, you don't like
"Princess Corncob"
18.733
18.900
you don't like "Fester,"
you're just impossible to please.
22.070

We'll come back to that one.

This brings us to the final item
25.352

27.742

Before you get upset,
39.420
39.587
I believe I've come up with
a way for us to celebrate
41.423
41.506
the occasion that we both can enjoy.
43.091
# SHELDON
43.258
People usually start
a meeting with a joke,

but you go ahead, end with one.

# AMY

I propose we spend a weekend
51.266

at a bed-and-breakfast
in Napa Valley.

# SHELDON
53.393
I hate every word in that sentence.

# AMY
61.526
Come on, Sheldon. Why not?
63.027
# SHELDON
63.194
For starters,
a bed-and-breakfast forces you
65.738
65.905
to eat with strangers at your table.
67.386
# AMY
67.386
One step ahead of you.
68.866

Bernadette and Wolowitz
are going with us.
70.743
# SHELDON
70.910
Very well. What are
the sleeping arrangements?
73.288
73.454
We've only been dating
for three years.
75.999
76.165
If we were to share a room,
people might talk.
78.960
79.200
**LOL**
# AMY
80.336
I got you your own room.
81.504
# SHELDON
81.671
What if my room has
a claw-foot bathtub?
83.506
# AMY
83.673
It doesn't. I know it makes you feel
like you're bathing inside a monster.
86.593

**LOL**
# SHELDON
88.219
Look, I appreciate the effort,
but I'm still unclear
91.681
91.848
how this trip is supposed
to be enjoyable for me.
95.018
# AMY
95.184
We're going to have
Valentine's Day dinner
97.061

163.169

We bust on each other.
165.588

188.027
I'm sorry, what?
189.278

# SHELDON

I'm afraid if we wear
the same pocket watch,
192.448
192.615
it will be embarrassing.

Since you two are gonna be
around for Valentine's,
210.049

would you mind
watching Cinnamon?
211.343
# PENNY
211.426
You have Valentine's plans?
213.511
213.678
Which came out sounding way
more surprised than I meant.
216.431
216.400
**LOL**
217.682
Let me try that again.
You have Val

# RAJ
221.373
I don't have plans,
223.271

which is why I booked time

# AMY
226.441
Well, an evening looking at the

237.326
Thank you. Oh, and I'd like
for at least one of us
239.245

to see some action, so if you

it's cool if she stays in the room.

Don't be surprised if you

Should we take this little

Does this train car have

with the original

They actually use
the AAR type "E" coupler.
392.815

built number 6131,
647.027
647.194
which rearranged
the drivers and cylinders,
648.946
649.113
solving the problem of the Q-1,
650.906
651.073
creating a duplex-drive
four-four-six-four.
652.867
# SHELDON
653.033
In what world is a
four-four-six-four a four-ten-four?
656.745
# HOWARD
656.912
A world I don't want to live in!
658.455
658.500
**LOL**
660.583
Seriously, I no longer want
to live in this world.
662.585

# MAN

Hold on to your conductor's hat.
You crank the second and third axles,
667.256
667.423
creating a pair of
internal connecting rods,
669.592
669.758
and boom! Four-ten-four.
If you think about it,
672.678
672.845
the Q-2 was like the four-ten-four
America never made.
675.222
# SHELDON
675.389
I may never stop thinking about it.
677.933
678.100
Amy, what are the odds
we run into this guy?
680.436
# WAITER
680.603
Better than you think.

You know, if you ask nicely, they'll
let you visit the engine room.

Hey, did I tell you what
happened to me at UPS?

# RAJ
702.833
As if Valentine's Day wasn't bad
enough, you try to kill my dog?!
706.420
706.587
And with cheap chocolate, no less?
708.589
# PENNY
708.756
It wasn't cheap.
It was free.
711.675

**LOL**
# LEONARD
712.968
We're really sorry.
It was an accident.
714.637
# PENNY
714.803
Yeah, we weren't even out
of the room that long.
716.472
# LEONARD
716.555
No, come on. It was a while.
718.849
719.100

It was a while.

Is Cinnamon gonna be OK?
726.023
# VET
726.023
She's responding well.
727.358
727.524
We just want to keep her
a little longer for observation.
729.985
# RAJ
730.152
All right. Would it be OK
for me to see her?
732.446
732.613
We're usually in bed by now,
and I want her to know that I'm here.
735.491
736.867
Yes, we sleep together,
and sometimes we spoon.
739.286
739.700
**LOL**
# VET
742.122
It's OK. I sleep with my dog, too.
743.874
745.042
We're not supposed
to let people in back, but...
747.086
747.253
...I think I can make an exception.
748.712
# RAJ
748.879
Thank you.
749.797

Come on.
750.714

By the way, I sang her Katy Perry.
753.196
# RAJ
753.196
Oh, yeah?
754.551
# VET
754.718
And I don't care what that obnoxious
parrot back there says. I crushed it.
758.514
758.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
759.932
I think there's something going
on between the two of them.
762.185
# LEONARD
762.268
Maybe, but you also think
nine minutes isn't a while,
764.770
764.937
so what do you know?
766.230
766.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
773.904
You OK?
774.947
# AMY
774.947
Why?
775.990
776.156
Because my boyfriend's off
playing choo-choo with some weirdo?
779.243
779.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
780.536
Well, to be fair,
they're both weirdos.
783.747

# AMY
785.040
I don't know what made me think
tonight would be any different.
787.126
# BERNADETTE
787.209
Well, just the fact that you got
him up here still says a lot.
790.587
790.754
To be honest, I bet Howie 200
bucks it wasn't gonna happen.
793.074
# HOWARD
793.215
I'm going to the LEGO store
to get a big-ass R2-D2.

**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
807.563
So your boyfriend's a fixer-upper.
Most of them are.
810.065
810.232
I mean, look at this guy.
You think he came like this?
812.568
812.735
When I met him,
he was a hot, goofy mess.
814.903
815.300
**LOL**
816.613
Now, he's been to space.
818.741
818.907
That's all me.

that's a while.

She's gonna be OK.
They're gonna let me take her home.

862.368
So I want you to keep
a close eye on her
863.619
863.702
for the next 24 hours.
864.870
865.037
Here are a few warning
signs to look out for.

If you see any of them,
don't hesitate to call.

we were taking it seriously.
879.260

917.300
**LOL**
917.548
Oh, and, Amy, guess what?
918.966
919.133
The conductor said as
soon as he gets off work,
920.968
921.051
he can come back to the bed and
breakfast and play his banjo for us.
924.304
925.000

# AMY

OK. I need to speak to my boyfriend
in private, like, right now.

There's a car with a glass roof.
Want to go look at the stars?

Excuse me.

I think you're being a little rude.

# AMY
947.494
I'm being rude? You've been
rude to me this entire evening.
950.205
# SHELDON
950.372
How is that possible?
951.915
952.082
I've hardly spoken
to you since we got on the train.
955.210

**LOL**
# MAN
957.212
I'm detecting a little
friction between you two,
959.381
959.548
and I don't want to be a third rail.
961.675
962.551
Get it?

I get it.

976.273
# SHELDON
976.440
Oh, really?
Because I remember you saying
978.942
979.109
that this trip was going to be
something we could both enjoy.
981.362
981.445
Did you mean that,
or were you just trying to trick me?
984.573
# AMY
985.365
Fine, it's true.
I deserve romance,
988.911
989.077
and I didn't know how
else to make it happen.
991.580
# SHELDON
992.414
Well, if you want romance,
then let's have romance!
996.627

Grape juice that burns.

Urn...
1037.793
1038.418
The conductor said if I come
back to the engine room,
1041.838
1042.005
he'd show me how to bring
the train through a crossing.
1045.467
# AMY
1047.386

1080.586
Hm. "Rajesh, I was
dreading Valentine's Day.
1083.171
1083.338
Thank you for spending it
with me. Yvette."
1086.842
1088.510
Cinnamon, she gave me
her phone number.
1092.556
1092.723
If I'd known it was that easy,
I would have considered
1094.099
1094.182
poisoning you months ago.
1095.976
1096.300

Oh, what should I say?
1099.479
1099.646
Oh, I know.
1101.106
1101.273
I'll point out her name's Yvette,
and that she's a vet.
1104.401
1104.568
That's hysterical.

I made a new friend

1117.539
who likes trains
as much as I do,
1119.374
1119.541
I kissed Amy on the lips,
1121.126
1121.293
and the conductor played his
banjo for me.
1124.129

Good night.

Well, my new
friend's name was Eric.

1131.803
Amy lips tasted like
the brownie we had for dessert.
1135.390
1135.500
**LOL**
1136.642
The banjo-playing
conductor was missing a finger,
1139.144

but he made up for it
with his can-do attitude.
