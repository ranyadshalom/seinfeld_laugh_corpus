Hi. Did Sheldon
change the Wi-Fi password again?

# LEONARD
7.926
Uh, yeah, it's "Penny already eats
our food, she can pay for Wi-Fi."
12.889
12.700
**LOL**
14.182
No spaces.
16.017
# PENNY
16.226
Okay. What makes you think you
can get me to stop using your Wi-Fi?
20.522
# SHELDON
20.730
I believe that you're capable
of great change.
23.316
23.525
Like, when I finally got you
to stop saying "Valentime's Day."
27.111
27.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
28.571
Wanna hear something weird?
29.385
# PENNY
29.385
Sure.
30.198
# SHELDON
30.406
In the year 2000...
32.116
32.300
**LOL**
32.325
...Pope John Paul ll was named
an honorary Harlem Globetrotter.
37.247

**LOL**
# LEONARD
39.374
What are you talking about?
41.543
# SHELDON
41.751
You asked Penny if she wanted
to hear something weird.
44.712
44.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
44.921
Well, yeah, because I have
something weird to tell her.
47.257
# SHELDON
47.465
Oh. I thought it was a game.
50.760

**LOL**
# PENNY

What's yours?
54.139
# LEONARD
54.139
There's this guy, Jimmy Speckerman.
55.557
55.765
He used to torment me
in high school.
57.934
58.142
He sent me a message
through Facebook.
59.894
60.103
He's in town and wants to have drinks.
61.459
# SHELDON
61.459
Okay, Penny.
62.814
63.022
If it were a game,
here are your choices.
64.941
65.149
An e-mail from an old acquaintance...
66.943
67.151
...or the head of one of the largest
religious institutions in the world...
70.738
70.947
...slam-dunking
to "Sweet Georgia Brown." Pick.
74.534
74.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
77.036
Just do it,
because he's not gonna let it go.
79.747

**LOL**
# PENNY
79.956
Basketball Pope.
81.458
# SHELDON

And that's how it's done.
82.959
83.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
85.378
What are you gonna do?
86.421
86.629
Are you gonna see him?
87.547
# LEONARD
87.547
I don't know.
88.464
# SHELDON
88.673
Is this the fellow who peed
in your Hawaiian Punch?
91.843
92.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
92.594
No, that was a different guy.
94.304
# SHELDON
94.804
Was he the one who wedgied you
so hard your testicle reascended...
97.974
98.182
...and you spent your whole Christmas
break waiting for it to come back down?
102.061
102.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
105.481
No, that was a different different guy.
107.567
107.500

# SHELDON
108.359
Was he the one who used your head
to open a nut?
111.571

# LEONARD
113.197
No.
114.219
# SHELDON
114.219
Oh, oh, oh.
115.241
115.450
Was he the one
who made you eat your arm hair?
118.328
118.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
119.746
No, but actually,
that was this guy's sister.
122.624
122.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
123.166
Well, what do you think he wants?
124.522
# LEONARD
124.522
I don't know.
125.877
# SHELDON
126.085
The holidays
are just around the corner.
127.920
128.129
Maybe he wants to see if he can lodge
the other testicle up there.
131.966
130.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
132.258
I told you. That was a different guy.
134.052
# PENNY
134.677
Mm, that's too bad. Could've spent New
Year's Eve waiting for the ball to drop.

Sure. Wanna see what all the scientists
are wearing this year.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
184.018
Look at these men.
185.645
185.853
They've managed to win
the top science prize in the world...
188.690
188.898
...with no more understanding
of the quantum underpinnings...
191.776
191.984
...of the expansion of the early universe
than God gave a goose.
195.196
195.800
**LOL**
197.699
You should pay attention, Leonard.
Someday it's gonna be you up there.
201.119
200.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
202.328
Thanks.
203.683
# SHELDON
203.683
So, what's got you up?
205.039
205.248
Did you have a bad clam?
207.667
207.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
208.209
I didn't have clams.
209.523
# SHELDON
209.523
I don't watch you 24 hours a day.
210.837
211.045
I don't know what you do.
213.005

# LEONARD
215.174
It's this Jimmy Speckerman thing.
I can't decide if I should agree...
218.469
218.678
...to see him or not. That might be
because the last time I ran into him...
222.265
222.473
...he made me floss
with my own shoelaces.
225.309
# SHELDON
226.227
Wear loafers.
227.687
228.100
**LOL**
229.605
Look at Dr. Saul Perlmutter up there
clutching that Nobel Prize.
232.984
233.192
What's the matter, Saul?
Afraid someone's gonna steal it?
235.820
236.028
Like you stole Einstein's
cosmological constant?
238.948
238.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
240.825
You know what?
I am tired of living in fear of this guy.
244.036
244.704
I'm gonna go see him...
245.955
246.164
...and say the things
I should have said in high school.
248.791
249.000
"Pick on someone your own size."
250.752
250.960
"No, you did not have sex
with my mother."
254.338
253.800
**LOL**
255.131
And, "Yes, I do know
why I'm hitting myself."
258.509
257.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
259.135
Oh. Now Perlmutter shaking
the king's hand.
260.970
261.179
Yeah. Check for your watch,
Gustaf, he might've lifted it.
264.265
266.700
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
267.268
I love this dress.
268.686
268.895
How come I never see you wear it?
270.730
# PENNY
270.730
Because when I wear it, it's a shirt.
272.565
273.200
**LOL**
275.026
So, what's Howard doing tonight?
276.903
# BERNADETTE
277.111
Oh, they all went with Leonard
to confront his childhood bully.
279.655
# PENNY
279.864
Oh. Terrific. High-school quarterback
against four mathletes.
284.410
284.000
**LOL**
# AMY
285.286
When Leonard gets back,
I'd love to check serotonin levels.
288.080
288.289
Do you think he'd let me
draw a syringe full of his blood?
290.917
291.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
291.125
Hmm. He's not crazy about needles.
292.960
293.169
But if you get him to go jogging,
it'll just pour out of his nose.
297.006
296.000

# BERNADETTE
297.548
I don't think I can meet the girl
who was always mean to me.
300.384
300.593
Tammy Bodnick.
One time while I was in gym class...
303.513
303.721
...she stole all my clothes
and left an elf costume in my locker.
308.184
307.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
309.018
Oh, that's awful.
311.062
# BERNADETTE
311.062
Worst part was it was too big.
313.105
312.900
**LOL**
# AMY
314.732
That's nothing. In ninth grade,
the girls put Rogaine in my hand lotion.
319.153
319.000
**LOL**
319.654
Within six months,
the nicknames began to fly.
322.240
322.448
I think the one that hurt the most
was Gorilla Fingers Fowler.
325.868

327.411
Oh. Wow, you poor thing.
330.164

What about you?
332.250
# PENNY
332.458
Oh, I don't know. My school
was a nice place. We didn't have bullies.
335.545
# AMY
335.753
Come on, no one ever gave anyone
mean nicknames, or picked on them...
339.549
339.757
...or put gum in their hairy knuckles
so the nurse had get it out?
344.595
343.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
344.804
No, we weren't really like that.
346.305
346.514
We played pranks on each other,
but it was never mean.
349.058
349.267
This girl, Kathy Geiger, got good grades
so we blindfolded her...
352.353
352.562
...tied her up
and left her in a cornfield overnight.
355.398

No, it was funny. Everyone laughed.

**LOL**
# AMY

Did Kathy Geiger laugh?
363.906
# PENNY

Uh, probably. It's hard to say. She kind
of had an ear of corn in her mouth.

377.441
# BERNADETTE
377.441
Kind of sounds like you were.

379.505
And maybe a felon.

I am going to make him apologize for

Oh, please.
That's the scientific equivalent...

You should've seen this guy
back in the day. Huh?

He was so little,
he could fit anywhere.
489.156
489.365

# JIMMY
509.593
Okay, here it is.
I have this great money-making idea.
512.388
512.596
I need a gear-head
to get it to the finish line.
514.849
# SHELDON
515.057
Mm, technically, Howard's the gear-head.
Leonard's just a dime-store laser jockey.

# LEONARD
519.729
What's the idea?

# LEONARD
522.564
Right.

That sounds amazing.
First movie I'm watching, Annie.

How exactly
would these glasses work?

How the hell should I know?
That's why I need a nerd.

563.189

What my spineless friend
lacks the courage to say...

566.067
...is you're a terrible person
who took advantage of his tiny size...

**LOL**
586.420
...in high school,
you picked on me a little bit.
588.714

A little bit? The man super-glued
Hershey's kisses to your nipples.

Nancy.

You called me Nancy

Man, I
632.383
632.675
I don't know what to say.
634.635
634.885
I thought
we were just having some fun.
636.679
# LEONARD
636.887
Well, it wasn't fun for me.
638.514
# SHELDON
639.723
You're being too kind, Leonard.
You ruined him.

# LEONARD
653.279
And for the record,
Jimmy wasn't the reason I wet the bed.

Ah. Okay, well,
I'm sorry you feel that way.
681.932

# AMY
685.477
Your mistake is doing it over the phone.

It doesn't matter what you did

Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
You weren't just called a "b-b-bitch."

# AMY
702.661
Perhaps you could assuage your guilt
through altruism.
705.247
707.300
**LOL**
708.959
Which word's tripping you up'?
711.212
711.420
Assuage or altruism?
713.297
713.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
715.049
Both.
716.884
# BERNADETTE
717.468
You'll feel better
by doing something nice for someone.

Oh, I actually knew that.

Ooh. I can't do that.

There's Habitat for Humanity.

I don't have my own house,
I'm gonna build one for someone else?

742.326
How about donating
some of your clothes?

# PENNY
745.621
Oh, my God, that's perfect, because
I have so many clothes I don't wear.
749.250
749.458
They're taking up space
I go shopping to buy more.
751.794
752.002
I have no place to put it.
This would fix that.

Yeah, yeah.
829.621

I drive better drunk, you know?
831.790

It makes you pay attention.

Then take away his keys...

It's funny, huh? Back in school,
I was the winner, and you were the loser.
860.986

And now we're reversed.

After all these years...

...your big, bad high-school bully
finally apologizes.

Yeah. It kind of rekindles your faith
in the basic goodness in people.

889.244
# RAJ
889.244
What's that?

# SHELDON
890.599
As a symbolic gesture to all the bullies
who've tormented us for years...
895.229

...we open our home to Jimmy,
and once he's asleep, we kill him.
900.651
