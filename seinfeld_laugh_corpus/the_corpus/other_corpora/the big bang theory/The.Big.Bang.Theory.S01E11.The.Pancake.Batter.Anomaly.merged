# PENNY
752.044
Oh, it's okay.
I didn't really need to work today.
754.296
754.463
It's not like I have rent
or car payments or anything.

Um, home to write some bad checks.

Sheldon, you are a grown man.
Haven't you ever been sick before?
775.942
# SHELDON
776.109
Of course, but not by myself.
779.321

**LOL**
# PENNY
779.488
Really? Never?
781.281
# SHELDON
781.448
Well, once, when I was 15
and spending the summer...
784.576
784.743
...at the Heidelberg Institute in Germany.
786.870
# PENNY
787.245
Studying abroad?
788.955
# SHELDON
788.955
No, visiting professor.
790.665
791.300
**LOL**
792.709
Anyway, the local cuisine was a little more
sausage-based than I'm used to...
796.880
797.047
...and the result
was an internal blitzkrieg...
799.174
799.341
...with my lower intestine
playing the part of Czechoslovakia.
803.095
802.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
803.678
And there was no one there
to take care of you?
805.847
# SHELDON
806.014
No, my morn had to fly back to Texas
to help my dad...
809.476
809.643
...because the house had slipped off
the cinder blocks again.
813.355
813.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
814.106
Again?
815.378
# SHELDON
815.378
It was tornado season.
816.650
816.817
And it was an aluminum house.
819.069
819.000
**LOL**
820.529
Anyway, the housekeeper in the faculty
residence didn't speak any English.
824.199
824.366
When I finally managed
to convince her I was sick...
826.785
826.952
...she said,
"Mֳ¶chtest Du eine Darmspֳ¼lung?"
830.330
830.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
830.705
What does that mean?
832.165
# SHELDON
832.332
Based on what happened next, I assume
it means, "Would you like an enema?"
835.877
836.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
838.255
Okay, sweetie. I'll take care of you.
What do you need?
842.259
# SHELDON
842.426
Well, my mom used to give me
sponge baths.

852.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
853.311
Okay, ground
854.354

No sponge baths

Hi, Penny?
909.659
909.826
I was just wondering,
is Sheldon still at the restaurant?
913.246
914.748
Okay, that was very nice of you.
Okay, I gotta go.
917.334
917.501
Got kind of a full-blown
Chernobyl thing here. Gotta go, bye.

One more thing.

1088.338
This is a sub-sonic impact sensor.
1092.676
1092.000
**LOL**
1092.842
If Sheldon gets out of bed
and starts to walk...
1095.053
1095.220
...this will register it
and send a signal to the laptop.
1097.847
1098.014
At that point, based on the geography of
the apartment and the speed of Sheldon...
1101.810
1101.976
...you'll have seven seconds to get out,
glasses or no glasses.
1105.522

# LEONARD
1105.689
Won't my footsteps set it off?
1107.399
# HOWARD
1107.565
No. You'll be on your hands and knees.
1109.943
1110.110
Now, you'll need to get the sensor
close to Sheldon's room.
1112.862

Now keep true.

1125.646
What?
1126.668
# HOWARD
1126.835
It means go straight.

1128.419
Then just say, "Go straight."
1130.004
1130.200
**LOL**

You don't say, "Go straight," when you're
giving bearings. You say, "Keep true."

to Sheldon's room. Deploy the sensor.
