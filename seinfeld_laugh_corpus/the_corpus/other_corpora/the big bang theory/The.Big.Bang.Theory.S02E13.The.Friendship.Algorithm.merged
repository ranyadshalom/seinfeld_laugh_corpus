The worst tapioca pudding...

of any other flavor.

First off, that is axiomatically wrong
because the best pudding is chocolate.

Secondly, the organic structure of tapioca
makes it a jiggling bowl of potential death.

It is extracted from the plant--

All right. Sheldon, why is tapioca--?
55.598
# SHELDON
55.765
Tapioca is extracted
from the root of Manihot esculenta.
58.351
58.517
Due to a high concentration of cyanide...
60.394
60.561
...it is poisonous in its raw form
and lethal if prepared improperly.

It's indigenous to Brazil, as is the cocoa

Oh, I do like monkeys.

# GIRL
667.084
Curious George is a monkey.
668.502
# SHELDON
669.044
Somewhat anthropomorphized, but yes.
672.714
672.500
**LOL**
673.340
Say...
675.175
675.342
...maybe sometime you and I
could go see monkeys together.
678.011

Would you like that?

Hi, Rebecca.
I'm your new friend, Sheldon.

No, you're not. Let's go.

I'm curious, in the "How Well Do
You Know Sheldon?" section...
703.412
703.578
...what did you put
for his favorite amino acid?
706.164
706.700
**LOL**
707.457
Lysine.
708.583
# RAJ
708.750
Damn it, I had lysine and changed it.

711.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
711.378
Oh, good. You're just in time.
713.297
713.463
I believe I've isolated the algorithm
for making friends.
717.634
717.100

# LEONARD
717.801
Sheldon, there is no algorithm
for making friends.

# HOWARD
720.887
Hear him out. If he's onto something,
we could open a booth at Comic-Con...
724.391
724.558
...make a fortune.
726.226
726.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
726.643
You see, my initial approach to Kripke
had the same deficiencies...
729.938
730.105
...as those that plagued Stu the Cockatoo
when he was new at the zoo.
733.900
733.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
734.985
Stu the Cockatoo?
736.737
# LEONARD
736.903
Yes. He's new at the zoo.
739.072
739.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
739.573
It's a terrific book. I've distilled its
essence into a simple flow chart...
743.076
743.243
...that will guide me through the process.
744.923
746.288
Have you thought about putting him
in a crate...
748.168
748.332
...while you're out of the apartment?
750.292
750.000
**LOL**
# HOWARD
750.917
Hello, Kripke.
Yeah, Sheldon Cooper here.
753.670
753.837
It occurred to me you hadn't returned
any of my calls...
756.590
756.757
...because I hadn't offered any suggestions
for pursuing our friendship.
760.427
760.594
Yeah, perhaps the two of us
might share a meal together.
765.349
764.900
**LOL**
765.891
Yeah, I see.
767.142
767.309
Well, then perhaps you'd have time
for a hot beverage?
771.271
771.100
**LOL**
771.438
Popular choices include tea,
coffee, cocoa.
775.150
775.400
I see. No, no, no, wait.
Don't hang up yet.
777.486
777.700
**LOL**
777.652
But what about a recreational activity?
780.447
780.614
I bet we share some common interests.
782.783
783.100
**LOL**
782.949
Tell me an interest of yours.
785.786
785.952
Really? On actual horses?

790.791
Tell me another interest of yours.

Oh, I'm sorry. I have no desire to get
in the water till I absolutely have to.

Uh-oh, he's stuck in an infinite loop.
801.822
# HOWARD
801.822
I can fix it.
803.136
# SHELDON
803.303
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
804.805
804.971
It's interesting but isn't ventriloquism
by definition a solo activity?
809.518
809.500
**LOL**
809.684
Yeah. Tell me another interest of yours.
813.021
813.188
Hmm.
814.481
814.648
Is there any chance you like monkeys?
817.401
816.900
**LOL**
817.818
Yeah, what is wrong with you?
819.152
819.319
Everybody likes monkeys.
821.696
821.100
**LOL**
822.155
Hang on, Kripke.
823.365
825.826
A loop counter and an escape
to the least objectionable activity.
830.497
830.664
Howard, that's brilliant.
832.332
832.499
I'm surprised you saw that.

Gee, why can't Sheldon make friends?
839.339
838.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
839.881
All right. That last interest strikes me
as the least objectionable.
843.468
843.635
And I would like to propose
that we do that together.
847.180
847.347
Tomorrow.
849.015
849.516
Yes, I'll pay.

851.685
All right, goodbye.
853.520
853.687
All right.

Maybe you, me and your dummy
could go get a hot beverage.

He could talk while you drink.

Nope. I wanna climb some rocks.

This appears significantly more monolithic
than it did on my laptop.
889.681
889.200

You know, one expects to see hominids
learning to use bones as weapons.

# KRIPKE

Hey, you afraid of heights, Cooper?
895.979
# SHELDON
895.979
Hardly.
897.063
897.230
A fear of heights is illogical.
899.566
899.733
Fear of falling, on the other hand,
is prudent and evolutionary.
903.111
902.900
**LOL**
903.737
What would you say
is the minimum altitude...
905.822

our newfound friendship?

Little kids climb this.

Let's go, Cooper.
927.677

Coming, Kripke.
929.679
929.846
Okay, harness seems to be secure.
933.517
934.017
A small amount of incontinence just now,
but the website said that's to be expected.

This isn't so bad.

951.952
953.300
**LOL**
954.496
I was wrong.

955.956
It is a fear of heights.

You all right there, Cooper?
959.709
# SHELDON
959.709
Not really.
960.794

I feel like an inverse tangent function
that's approaching an asymptote.
964.965
964.600
**LOL**
# KRIPKE

Stuck?
966.257
# SHELDON

What part of "inverse tangent function...

...approaching an asymptote"
did you not understand?

# SHELDON
974.766
Yeah, I don't think I can.
975.976
# KRIPKE
976.142
Well, then climb back down.

No, that doesn't seem any more likely.

So, what's the plan, Cooper?
983.316

But it was worth it. I've made substantial
