Your argument is lacking
in all scientific merit.
4.839
5.006
And it is well-established...
6.591
6.757
...Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth's yellow sun...
10.094
10.261
...which incinerates
any contaminant matter...
12.346
12.513
...and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.
16.851

# HOWARD

What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?
20.146
# SHELDON
20.313
Like what?
22.273
# HOWARD
22.273
I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.
24.233
23.900
**LOL**
# SHELDON
24.400
I think we can assume all Kryptonian
condiments were destroyed...
27.486
27.653
...when the planet Krypton exploded.
30.239
29.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
30.406
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite.
32.366

The only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hot dog threatening Earth.

Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.
43.919
# HOWARD
44.086
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?
46.589
45.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
47.048
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.
48.841
# HOWARD
49.008
Okay. He's invited for dinner
in the bottle city of Kandor.
51.719
51.886
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city,
where he loses his super-powers.
55.306
55.473
Before dinner, his host says,
"Who's up for Kryptonian tetherball?"
58.559
58.900
**LOL**
58.726
Superman works up a sweat, comes back
to Earth, his uniform now stained...
61.937
62.104
...with indestructible
Kryptonian perspiration.

Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry-cleaner...

107.149
107.316
His observation of high-energy positrons

# SHELDON

In the pre-Christian era, as the winter
solstice approached and the plants died...
343.135
343.302
...pagans brought evergreen boughs in their
homes as an act of sympathetic magic...
347.181
347.348
...intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.
350.559
350.726
This custom was appropriated
by northern Europeans...

353.354
...and, eventually, it becomes
the so-called Christmas tree.

You don't have to get me anything.

Of course I do. The essence of the custom
is that I now have to go and purchase...
403.404
403.570
...a gift of commensurate value and
representing the same level of friendship...
407.282
407.449

you've given me.

Really? We're gonna do an experiment?
788.622

Uh-huh.

We're gonna explore the effects of tequila

You see, the danger was that
I might under- or over-reciprocate...
846.304
846.471
...but I have devised a foolproof plan.
848.390
848.974
I will open her gift to me first and then
excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.
854.271
854.438
Then I'll look up the price
of her gift online...
857.524
855.300

857.691
...choose the basket closest to that value,
give it to her...

911.453
911.620
While I am perfectly happy
with the way things are...
914.080
914.247
...you said that you didn't wanna go out
with me because I was too smart for you.
917.959
918.126
Well, news flash,
920.212
920.212
David Underhill
is 10 times smarter than me.
922.297

You'd have to drive a railroad spike into
his brain for me to beat him at checkers.

Next to him, I'm one of those sign-language

933.308
So my question is...
935.936

Because a smart guy takes the nude photos
of his wife off his cell phone...

of his girlfriend.
