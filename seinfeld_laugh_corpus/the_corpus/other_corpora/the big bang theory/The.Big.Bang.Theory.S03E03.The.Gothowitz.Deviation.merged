Wanna make some noise

Yeah, I wanna scream and shout

Penny, while I subscribe
to the Many-Worlds theory...
35.492
35.660
...which posits the existence of infinite
Sheldons in an infinite number...

that none of them am I dancing.

The math would suggest that in a few,

# LEONARD
85.585
We did, but there
were extenuating circumstances.
88.253
# SHELDON

I see. Did her abysmal housekeeping
skills finally trump her perkiness?
92.341

No, her bed kind of broke.

That doesn't seem likely.
Her bed's of sturdy construction.

**LOL**
103.436
Even the addition
of a second normal-sized human...
105.896
106.064
...wouldn't cause a structural failure,
much less a homunculus such as yourself.

Now, that would be impossible.

I'm saying you can catch more flies

You can catch even more flies
with manure. What's your point?

Easily calculable. We begin by identifying
the set of couples with unisex names.

We eliminate those unqualified

You said be nice to Penny.

726.434
When there are vampires
and miscellaneous undead out and about.

That sounds really cool.
736.651
# HOWARD
737.820
Does it?
Well, okay, if you like space stuff...
740.363
740.573
...I designed components
for the space station. Which is in space.
743.700
743.868
Where, as I'm sure you know,
no one can hear you scream.

I work at the Gap.

753.210
Really? How about that?
I've been to the Gap.
756.171
# RAJ
756.338
I've been there as well.
I like your T-shirts with the little pocket.

760.634
I work there too.
762.010

Not that anyone cares.
764.387
764.000
**LOL**
766.223
You know, this place is boring.
768.683
# BETHANY
769.185
Yeah. Why don't we go somewhere else
and have some fun?
772.854
# HOWARD
773.147
Okay.
774.273
774.600
**LOL**
# RAJ
774.273
Sure. We like fun.

775.608
We are fun people.
776.858

777.026
Uh, dark and fun.

Come on. I know a place you'll really dig.
781.988
# HOWARD

Did you bring the black condoms?
785.888
# RAJ
785.888
In my fanny pack.

Oh, my God, she didn't.
808.056

# LEONARD
809.433
What could she possibly be talking
about for so long?
811.935
# SHELDON
812.436
Obviously, waitressing
at the Cheesecake Factory...
814.896
815.064
...is a complex socio-economic activity...
817.524
817.691
...that requires a great deal
of analysis and planning.
821.444
821.000
**LOL**
823.489
Buzzinga.
825.740
825.000
**LOL**
826.450
You know, using positive
reinforcement techniques...
829.744
829.912
...I could train that behavior out of her
in a week.
832.914
832.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
833.082
No.
834.207
# SHELDON
834.207
If you let me use negative reinforcement...
835.333
835.501
...I can get it done before we go to bed.
837.919
837.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
838.087
You're not squirting her in the face
with water.
840.463
# SHELDON
840.673
No, of course not.
842.590
842.758
We're talking very mild electric shocks.
844.759
844.800
**LOL**
845.928
No tissue damage whatsoever.
848.221
# LEONARD
848.597
Forget it.
849.681
# SHELDON
849.681
Oh, come on.
850.765
850.933
You can't tell me
that you're not intrigued...
853.393
853.561
...about the possibility
of building a better girlfriend.
856.437
856.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
856.605
I'm not.
857.897
858.065
Penny's qualities, both good and bad,
are what make her who she is.
861.943
864.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
865.739
You mean like that
high-pitched irritating laugh?
868.616
# LEONARD
869.952
Yes.
870.952
870.700
**LOL**
871.120
You wouldn't prefer a throaty chuckle?
874.122
# LEONARD
874.290
You're not changing how Penny laughs.
876.124
# SHELDON
876.292
No, that would be incongruous.
878.918
879.086
I was going to lower the whole voice
to a more pleasing register.
882.797
882.100
**LOL**
882.965
Ugh, sorry, guys.
884.632

That girl is freaky.

# SHELDON
888.345
Come again?
889.659
889.659
Freaky.

Are you seriously
going to deface your body...
916.039
916.248
...just on the possibility you could have
cheap sex with a girl you met in a bar?
920.168

Uh, yeah.

She's not gonna see it.

She takes my temperature orally now.

934.683
Well, I can't really decide
between a screaming devil...
937.852
938.020
...this mean little skull,
or Kermit the Frog.
941.522
941.300
**LOL**
# BETHANY

Kermit the Frog?

You know:
943.608
943.776
"Heigh-ho, I'm on Howard's butt. "
946.027
946.600
**LOL**
# BETHANY
947.780
Get the mean little skull,
and I'll see if I can make him smile.
951.366

Yeah, I'd like the mean little skull, please.

I'm putting on the stencil.

Aah! Okay, that's it. No needle.
No pain. No tattoo.
983.272

983.440
What's the big deal?
You've done this before.
985.733

985.901
No, I haven't. Look.
988.569
988.500
**LOL**

I'm sorry. I'm a fraud. He's a fraud.
991.573
# RAJ

We're both frauds.
993.408
# HOWARD
993.575
Yeah, I think I covered that.
995.159

995.159
Well, I was summing up.

Very, very smart guys.
1004.627

1004.837
So you were totally scamming us?
1006.587
# HOWARD
1007.381
Yes.
1008.756
1008.924
And I wouldn't blame you
if you walked out of here...
1011.551
1011.719
...and never wanted to see us again.
1014.053
1014.221
Unless, of course, our bold honesty
has suddenly made us attractive.
1017.765
1017.933
Huh? Huh? Anything?

What are you thinking,
maybe a big musical number?

Well, I'm going to make some warm milk
and then turn in.
1054.635

I trust if you two are planning
on engaging in amorous activities...

1077.493
Well, my new bed got delivered.
1078.993

If you put it together,
you can stay at my place.

Sex works even better than chocolate
to modify behavior.

Okay, wait, how about this?
1112.193
1112.361
We say there were four goth girls.
1114.487
1114.655
The two girls in the club had two friends.

# RAJ
1117.407
I like it, I like it.

Did they smell good
despite their goth-like nature?

1121.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
1122.204
What's that gotta do with the story?
1123.809
# RAJ
1123.809
Engaging my olfactory sense...
1125.414
1125.582
... helps make it real for me.
1126.687
# HOWARD
1126.687
Fine, they smelled good.
1127.792
# RAJ
1127.960
Oh, they did.
Like jasmine and honeysuckle.

1131.800
**LOL**
# HOWARD
1132.840
Whatever.
1133.631
# RAJ
1133.631
And they held hands...
1134.423
1134.591
...and did a sexy demonic hokey-pokey
for us.
1137.385
1137.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
1137.886
No. Let me say my story all the way,
and then you can say yours...
1141.013
1141.181
... then we'll pick.
1142.098
# RAJ
1142.098
I'm sorry. Go on.
1143.015
# HOWARD
1143.183
We got tattoos, and then the four girls
took us to their place.
1146.269
# RAJ
1146.436
We don't have tattoos. What if someone
asks to see our tattoos?
1149.438
# HOWARD
1149.815
We say they're in a very intimate area.
1153.067
# RAJ
1153.235
Oh, we are bad boys, aren't we?
1155.570
1155.500

Right. Right.
1157.468
1157.468
Yeah. Ha, ha.
1158.698
1158.866
So we go back to their place,
and then the six of us end up in a hot tub.
1162.577
# RAJ
1162.744
But we just got tattoos. Wouldn't we be
concerned about bacterial infection?
1166.956
1166.400
**LOL**
# HOWARD
1167.708
True. Okay, forget the hot tub.
1169.917
1170.085
The point is, we each had a mיnage
with sexy goth girls.
