Slowly. Like putting a new fish in a tank.
You don't just drop it in.

There were no awkward hellos

There's no clickety-clacking
of high-heel shoes on hardwood floors.

They may as well have been a family of cats
just jumping around from drape to drape.
105.022

You're right, I can't. You know what?
Anyone could rent that apartment now.

In what I can only perceive
as a tactical move to destroy me...

It's axiomatically atypical.

Until recently, they did not know Alicia, and
had no encounters in a previous location.
550.676
550.884
They never went
to visit the former tenants.
553.095

So your characterization of their behavior
as typical is demonstrably fallacious.

# ALICIA
643.936
I've been here three months.
All I've gotten is a couple commercials.
647.147
647.314
And this recurring thing on a soap.
649.316
650.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
652.236
That's why I work at The Cheesecake Factory.
I'm holding out for the right part.

Alicia, what do you want as your default
setting for DVDs, 5.1 Dolby or DTS?
664.498
# ALICIA
665.165
Whatever you think is best, cutie.
667.167
# LEONARD
670.587
Well, DTS has more low-end...
673.507
674.883
...so okay.
676.343
676.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
678.512
Hey, guys, you will really appreciate this. I
read the best science joke on the Internet.
683.016
683.225
Alicia, you won't get it,
but it's right up their alley.
685.936
685.700
**LOL**
686.144
Anyway, so this physicist goes
into an ice cream parlor every week...
689.356
689.523
...orders an ice cream sundae
for himself...
691.525
691.733
...and offers one to the empty stool
next to him.
694.027
694.194
This goes on until the owner
asks him what he's doing.
697.030
697.197
The man says, "Well, I'm a physicist...
699.574
699.783
...and quantum mechanics teaches us...
703.203
703.000
**LOL**
704.246
...that it is possible
for the matter above this stool...
706.873
707.082
...to spontaneously turn
into a beautiful woman...
709.376
709.543
...who might accept my offer
and fall in love."
711.920
712.129
The owner then says,
"Lots of women come in here every day.
714.840
715.048
Why don't you buy an ice cream for them,
and they might fall in love?"
718.343
718.552
And the physicist
719.761
719.970
"Yeah, but what are
the odds of that happening?" Ha.
723.056
725.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
728.145
That's a little insulting, don't you think?
730.564
# PENNY
731.023
How would I know?
I'm not even sure I get it.
733.900
734.000
**LOL**
# ALICIA
735.569
Hey, Leonard?
737.070
737.279
If you're done with the DVD player,
can you set up my printer?
740.240
# LEONARD
740.407
Oh, yeah, I'd love to.
741.742
# PENNY
743.452
When you're done with her printer,
you could set up mine.
746.079
746.288
You know, like you promised,
a week ago?
748.582
# LEONARD
748.790
Yeah, I'll get to it. Don't nag me.

I don't even know why I care.
I don't care.

All right, I cared enough to memorize
that stupid joke, but that's all I care.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
804.888
You know, Penny...
806.014
806.223
...there's something that occurs in
beehives you might find interesting.
809.810
809.976
Occasionally, a new queen will arrive
while the old queen is still in power.
815.190
815.399
When this happens, the old queen
must either locate to a new hive...
819.486
819.694
...or engage in a battle to the death
until only one queen remains.
825.659
825.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
827.369
What are you saying?
That I'm threatened by Alicia?
829.996
830.163
That I'm like the old queen of the hive,
and it's just time for me to go?
833.959
# SHELDON
834.167
I'm just talking about bees.

No occasion.

Just felt like getting some Chinese chow

Did you remember to ask for the chicken
to be diced not shredded?

Even though the menu
specifies shredded?

Brown rice, not white? Stop at the grocery

Pick up the low-sodium soy sauce

I cannot believe they're letting her
just use them like that.

Anything she wants, they go panting
after her like trained dogs.
947.822
948.031
Just last week, she had Howard
drive to her uncle's house...
950.784
950.992
...in Orange County to pick up her TV?

# PENNY
1038.121
Let's see. How can I explain this?
1040.957
1041.207
They don't know how to use their shields.
1042.918
# ALICIA
1042.918
Shields?
1044.628
