Your hypothesis is completely disconfirmed

You're just clinging to it
out of intellectual stubbornness.

# RAJ
11.434
No, you're displaying a shocking ignorance
of the subject matter.

are the exact same thing.

Oh, yeah?

That's called a fashion choice.

If a zombie bites you...
33.164
33.200
**LOL**
33.915
...you turn into a zombie.
35.250
35.458
However, if a mummy bites you...
37.085
37.293
...all you turn into
is some schmo with a mummy bite.
39.879
40.088
So, like a zombie that's been eaten
from the waist down...
43.550
40.700
**LOL**

...you, sir, have no leg to stand on.

Congratulations.
Does it have that new-car smell?

# HOWARD
66.906
Yep. For as long
as I can keep my mother out of it.
69.409
69.700

If you wanna check it out later,
it's parked right out front, Space 294.

I'm sorry, 294?
76.019
# HOWARD
76.019

That's my parking spot.

Why do you have a parking spot?
You don't have a car. You don't drive.
84.632

84.841
It doesn't matter. That's my spot.
87.343
87.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
88.595
Maybe they reassigned it
because you never use it.
90.888
# SHELDON

I'm not using my nipples either.
Maybe they should reassign those.

# HOWARD
95.518
Sheldon, someday, if you get a car...
99.147
99.355
...I'm sure they'll give you
another parking space.
101.691
# SHELDON
101.899
I don't want another parking space.
I want my parking space.
104.944
105.153
Well, it's perfect. It's a corner spot,
cutting the risk of door dings in half.
109.198
108.500
**LOL**
109.449
It's a mere 28 steps
from the building entrance.
111.618
111.826
The nearby tree provides shade
on hot days...
115.163
115.371
...and is also home
to a delightful squirrel...
118.041
118.291
...which is fortuitous
because most squirrels are real jerks.
122.295
121.500
**LOL**
# HOWARD
124.964
Fun story.
Meanwhile, you still don't have a car.
128.134
# SHELDON
128.343
Don't try to change the subject.
129.844
130.053
This is about a parking space.
It has nothing to do with cars.
133.348
133.500

# HOWARD
134.223
Are you listening to yourself?
135.558

I always listen to myself.
It's one of the great joys of my life.
138.811
139.200

Nope.

Very well, you leave me no choice.

What are you looking at,
you stupid squirrel?

**LOL**
183.231
President Seibert, listen to reason.
186.067
186.275
Yeah, I understand
I don't use the parking spot.
189.237
189.445
That's not the point. I
191.698
191.000
**LOL**
191.906
Yes, I'm aware you told me
not to call you at home.
195.618
196.119
But you didn't answer the door.
197.578
198.800
**LOL**
199.247
And I know you were there
because I saw you through the mail slot.
202.583
203.292
Yeah, well, that's some salty language.
205.628
205.878
May I remind you, you're the president
of a major university...
208.798
209.006
...not the president
of the Potty Mouth Club.
211.551
211.100
**LOL**
211.759
There it is again.
213.010
213.219
Do you kiss your mother
with that mouth?
215.763
215.100

216.222
Oh. Well, I'm sorry for your loss.
218.391
219.000

Good night, sir.
220.643

Unbelievable.
222.478
# LEONARD
222.895
He says Wolowitz deserves my spot...
225.022
225.231
...because he's a high-profile asset
to the university.
227.734
227.942
Well, he's not wrong. Howard did go
to the International Space Station.
231.612
# SHELDON
231.821
That was five weeks ago.
233.072
233.281
How much longer
is he gonna milk that cow?

Sheldon, let it go. It's not a big deal.
238.995
# SHELDON
239.162
No. No, this is a slippery slope, Leonard.
241.164
241.330
See, it starts with a parking space.
Where does it end?
244.000
244.167
It's like my dad always said,
"First they say you can't drink and drive.
247.670
247.920
Next you can't let your 10-year-old
take the wheel...
250.423
250.631
...while you sleep one off
in the backseat."
253.259

Leonard, you're my best friend.
Why don't you ever take my side?

your side!

but could you be more specific?

My Iron Man helmet.

# AMY
366.372
For hours. Fortunately,
I couldn't understand most of it...
369.083

...because Sheldon was wearing
that stupid robot mask.
371.961
372.100

# BERNADETTE
372.962
Howard was so angry, I had
to mash up Benadryl in his ice cream...

392.982
I'm really sorry
they took Sheldon's spot away.

He shouldn't have to suffer
just because Howard's a big deal now.

I know. Sheldon should just let Howard
have his little moment in the sun.

# AMY

# BERNADETTE
412.168
You're right. And I'm sure Sheldon
will get a fancy parking spot again...

...if and when he makes
a worthwhile contribution to science.

Still chilly down there?

You know, I remember the first time
I got a bikini wax.

**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
458.047
Gosh, Amy. I'm sensing a little hostility.
460.299

Is it maybe because, like Sheldon's work,
your sex life is also theoretical?
464.971

...Sheldon won't be thinking
about his mother.
476.565
476.900
**LOL**
479.068
That is a cleverly veiled reference
to Howard's lifelong obsession...

...to crawl back into her spacious womb.

He had my car towed.
It cost me $200 to get it back.

Well, that doesn't make sense.
Sheldon doesn't have a spot.

Well, that doesn't make sense either.
713.052
# AMY
713.052
Why not?
714.386
# BERNADETTE

it's not worth fighting over the spot...
986.533
986.742
...so you keep it...
