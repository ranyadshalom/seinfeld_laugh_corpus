What are you drawing over there?

# SHELDON

A hypothetical containment field
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole...
10.600
10.767
...that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

# HOWARD

Oh, you silly doodlebug.

**LOL**
# LEONARD

A lot of scientists believe
making contact with other life-forms...
21.277
21.444
...would probably not end well for us.
23.613
# SHELDON
23.821
It's a Frisbee-sized Wormhole, Leonard.
25.698
25.865
You could block it with a Frisbee.
Calm down.

Do you expect me to build this? Heh.

Have you guys ever noticed that Sheldon
always disappears every day at 2:45?
43.132
# LEONARD
43.341
Really?
44.467
# RAJ
44.467
He probably just goes to the bathroom.
45.593
# LEONARD
45.760
Actually, no. He goes at 8 a.m.
with optional follow-ups...
48.555
48.721
...at 1:45 and 7:10 on high-fiber Fridays.
52.642
52.400
**LOL**
# RAJ
53.810
It's sad that you know that.
55.436

Oh...
That's just the tip of the sadness iceberg.
58.481

**LOL**
# HOWARD
60.650
I'm looking at his public calendar.
62.652
62.819
Two-forty-five to 3:05, nothing.
65.738
65.905
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05, nothing.
68.157
68.366
Last week, nothing. Last month, nothing.
70.952
71.119
He never has anything booked
during that time.
73.663
# RAJ
73.871
Twenty minutes a day
completely unaccounted for.
76.666
# HOWARD
76.874
We should figure out where he goes.
78.689
# RAJ
78.689
Ooh, this is exciting.
80.503
81.300

81.671
Like one of my classic
murder-mystery dinner parties.
84.507

Right, the case of who murdered
three Saturday nights of my life.

Colonel Koothrappali in the kitchen

126.090
Well, I spent most of the afternoon
growing isotopically pure crystals...
129.469

Relax, he's just a friend. We're doing
an oral report together. He's really nice.
152.158

152.325
I'm sorry, what was that?
I had a little stroke after "oral."

155.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
156.537
Would you stop?
157.914
159.332
He moved here from London.
He doesn't know anybody.

161.834
Oh, good, an English accent,
the sexiest accent you can have.

Did you tell him you have a boyfriend?
175.014
# PENNY
175.014
It didn't come up.
176.349
# LEONARD
176.516
Maybe you should tell him.
178.059
# PENNY
178.226
What am I supposed to say'?
179.852
# LEONARD
180.019
Say, "Can't talk right now.
Hanging with my boyfriend.
182.522
182.689
England sucks, you suck,
U.S.A. number one."
185.483

# PENNY
188.820
Fine. "Hanging with my boyfriend.
Talk to you later."
193.658

# PENNY
225.481
He's not, we're just friends.
ls this gonna be a problem?
228.109
228.276
He's supposed to come over
tomorrow to work.
230.570
# LEONARD
230.737
Really? Here?
231.904
# PENNY
232.071
If it makes you uncomfortable, I'll switch
partners even though the thing's due...
235.908
236.075
...and everyone already has a partner
and I'll probably end up failing the class.

326.812
I think it's an old storage room.

# HOWARD
328.709
What could he be doing in there every day
for 20 minutes?
332.672
# RAJ
332.839
Well, he's not doing 20-minute abs...
334.549
334.715
...because if he were,
he'd have way better abs.

He is kind of a weirdo.

Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

Earth are more attractive than you.

While unlikely,
it's still a statistical possibility.

Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

767.398
And my mother.
768.565
769.300

My girlfriend knows this guy at school.
He's got an English accent

Anyway, I feel like he's hitting on her.
799.638
799.805
She says he's just being nice
and I should trust her.
802.433
# ALEX
802.599
It's probably harmless.
804.435
804.601
You know how it is.
I'm sure you get hit on all the time.
808.063
# LEONARD
809.940
Right.
811.775
811.400
**LOL**
812.609
Because girls are always like, "Ooh,
that guy owns two Star Trek uniforms...
815.946

...and gets a lot of ear infections.
I gotta get me some of that."
820.117

You're cute, you're funny.

It's hard sometimes.

Everywhere you go, guys hit on you.
980.486
980.652
Even if I'm standing right there.
982.696
982.863
And they're all taller than me.
Why is everyone taller than me?
