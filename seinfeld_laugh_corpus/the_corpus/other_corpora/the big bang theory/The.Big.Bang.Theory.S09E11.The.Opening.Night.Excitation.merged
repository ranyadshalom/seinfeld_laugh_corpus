Wait. Are you sure
they're Star Wars tickets?

No, it's Steel Magnolias 2: Even Steelier.

What are we gonna do?

# SHELDON
78.001
All right, this goes
against everything I stand for,
80.041
80.169
but desperate times
call for desperate measures.
82.049
82.171
Lord...
83.172

86.551
This is Sheldon Cooper.
87.677

You're good friends with my mom.

I'm also really happy,

New Star Wars in three days!

# SHELDON
133.264
Hey, Thursday can't get here soon enough.
135.475
135.642
I'm taking off work
to watch the original trilogy
138.186
138.353
while I eat enough Star Wars
cereal to choke a Wookiee.
140.813
141.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
142.940
Uh, sweetie, you do realize
Thursday is Amy's birthday.
145.610
# SHELDON
145.777
Yeah, and you do realize
I bought my ticket
148.237
148.404
when Amy and I were broken up?
149.739
150.300
**LOL**
151.574
I hope you didn't
need anything in that case,
153.285
153.368
'cause it's closed.

# PENNY

You guys just got back together.
157.706

# LEONARD
159.749
I think Penny has a point.
You can see it another day.
161.869
# SHELDON
162.001
But someone might spoil the movie.
163.795
163.961
No, no one can spoil
Amy's birthday for me.
166.047
166.214
Surprise! She's even older.
Who saw that coming?
168.257

Aw! That's nice. Put that on her cake.

# ARTHUR
190.321
Beats me. I just
192.657
192.824
hope this isn't a sex dream.
194.951
195.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
197.370
In the past, you've come to me
when I'm struggling with a dilemma.
200.790
# ARTHUR
201.124
And... And the one time where...
Where you were afraid,
204.627
204.794
and you needed me for...
For a night light.
207.255
208.100
**LOL**
210.216
What's... What's troubling you?
211.509
# SHELDON
212.677
Well...
214.512
214.679
My friends are telling me
216.139
216.305
I shouldn't abandon my girlfriend
on her birthday
219.142
219.308
to see the new Star Wars movie.
221.436
# ARTHUR
221.644
Well, sounds right.
223.229
223.800
**LOL**
225.231
Can... Can I get out of this mumu now?
228.818
229.500
**LOL**
# SHELDON
230.653
Those are the robes of the Jedi,
232.488
232.655
the guardians of peace
and justice in the galaxy.
235.575
# ARTHUR
235.908
And they... They...
They don't wear underwear.
238.745
239.400
**LOL**
# SHELDON
244.834
So, you agree with my friends
that I should skip the premiere?
249.172
# ARTHUR
250.923
Do... Do you love this girl?
253.134
# SHELDON
253.301
Yes.
254.510
254.677
But she knows
how important Star Wars is to me.
258.014
# ARTHUR
258.264
Well, maybe you should show her how...
260.600
260.767
How important she is to you.
263.186
# SHELDON
263.853
By seeing the movie she'd want me to see?
265.897
266.700
**LOL**
# ARTHUR
268.316
Sheldon, you can see this movie
whenever you want.
271.152
272.528
But you only have a limited number of days
275.656
275.823
that you can be with this woman.
278.242
279.327
Be with her.
280.328
# SHELDON
283.206
You're right.
284.290
# ARTHUR
284.791
Great.
285.792
# SHELDON
287.418
Where are you going?
288.753
# ARTHUR
289.378
I don't know,
291.380
291.547
but, hopefully,
somewhere I can wear pants.
293.508
294.500
**LOL**
303.601
Sheldon, what's wrong?
304.894
# SHELDON
305.311
I wanted to let you know
I'll be spending your birthday with you.
308.314
# AMY
309.565
Okay.
310.650
311.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
311.984
See, I had tickets
to the Star Wars premiere that night,
314.779
315.071
but Professor Proton
came to me in a dream,
317.073
317.240
dressed as Obi-Wan Kenobi,
and convinced me I should be with you.
320.117
# AMY
321.369
Obi-what?
322.370
322.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
323.788
I'll let you get back to sleep now.
Good night.
325.832
# AMY
325.998
Okay. Good night. Wait... Sheldon,
328.918
329.085
were you actually not gonna
spend my birthday with me?
331.629
332.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
334.423
It's late. Got to go. Bye.

Good for Sheldon deciding
339.220
339.387
to stay with Amy on her birthday.
340.326
# LEONARD
340.326
I know.
341.264
341.472
It's still gonna be weird
to see the movie without him.
343.558
# HOWARD
343.641
Well, we could wait a couple of days
and see it together.
346.978
349.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
351.274
Hello.
352.358
# LEONARD
352.525
Hey. We're going to the comic book store.
You want to come?
354.444
# SHELDON
354.527
No, I can't.
355.570
355.736
I need to make preparations
for Amy's birthday.
357.905
358.239
Which leads me
to the following bit of business.
360.950
361.117
This is my ticket to Star Wars.
363.703
363.870
I don't have to tell you
364.954
365.121
it is worth far more
than its face value of $15.50.
368.624
369.100
**LOL**
370.126
I trust you'll give it to someone worthy.
372.295
# LEONARD
373.129
You got it.
374.338
374.505
Well, Penny might want to join us
375.905
376.007
This is my ticket to Star Wars.
378.301
377.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON

Keep it up. I got nowhere else to be.
401.490
401.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
403.117
Just come in.
404.118
# SHELDON
405.995
For future reference,
if I want to watch Mean Girls,
407.914
407.997
I'll stream it on Netflix.
409.123
410.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
411.083
We're sorry. What do you need?
412.585
# SHELDON
412.752
Well, as you know,
413.753
413.920
I'll be celebrating
Amy's birthday with her,
415.963
416.130
and I could use your assistance
in helping me select the perfect gift.
419.091
# BERNADETTE
419.258
Sure.
419.884
# SHELDON
419.884
Well, so far,
420.509
420.676
I've come up with three ideas.
421.761
421.844
The first is a chance for her
423.220
423.387
to play the harp
with the LA Philharmonic.
425.473
# PENNY
425.640
Wow. You can really arrange that?
427.224
# SHELDON
427.391
Well, I said a chance, you know.
428.893
429.060
When you tell them it's your birthday
at Bennigan's, they make a fuss.
431.771
429.700
**LOL**
431.854
I don't see why the Philharmonic
would be any different.
434.054
433.800
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
435.107
How about
something a little more realistic?
437.109
# SHELDON
437.318
Well, Amy enjoys
knitting her own sweaters.
439.737
439.904
So, I was thinking
of getting her an all-expense-paid trip
442.573
442.740
to the Wisconsin Sheep & Wool Festival.
444.867
445.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
448.496
Sorry. I was waiting for the "bazinga."
450.206
451.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
452.041
Hold on. It could be romantic.
453.793
453.960
The two of them away together,
455.160
455.252
keeping each other warm
in snowy Wisconsin.
457.213
# SHELDON
457.380
No, no, no, no. She'd be going alone.
459.048
459.215
But if you think I'm afraid of birds,
you should see me around sheep.
461.935
462.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
462.885
Okay, well, what's the third option?
464.345
# SHELDON
464.512
That I have coitus with her.
465.888
467.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
474.772
What do you think about
giving Sheldon's ticket to Stuart?
477.149
# RAJ
477.900
I don't know.
478.901
479.068
Have you ever
seen a movie with Stuart before?
481.070
# HOWARD
481.237
It's like going with your grandpa.
482.905
483.600
**LOL**
484.240
Instead of eating popcorn,
485.280
485.408
he brings little pieces
of chicken in Tupperware
487.576
487.743
and a thermos full of soup.
488.911
489.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
490.788
He's not that bad.
491.831
492.081
Hey, Stuart, got any plans Thursday night?
494.917
# STUART
495.084
My... My doctor's worried
about my circulation,
497.586
497.753
so I was thinking about
walking around the mall.
499.714
500.500
**LOL**
501.716
Why?
502.842
# LEONARD
503.009
Well--
503.572
# WILWHEATON
503.572
Hey, you guys.
504.135
# HOWARD
504.301
Make sure to wear sensible shoes.
505.720
505.886
Wil, want to go to Star Wars, Thursday?
507.555
507.600
**LOL**
# WIL
508.431
Absolutely.
509.557
# STUART
509.724
Fine. Take Wil.
510.933
511.100
See if he brings you clam chowder.
512.768
513.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
515.396
Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay...
517.148
517.314
Let's... Let's...
Let's just recap our options.
519.442
519.608
All right, we've got
harp thing, sheep thing...
522.194
# BERNADETTE
522.445
Wild thing.
523.446
524.000
**LOL**
# SHELDON
527.116
Which do you think she'd prefer?
528.659
529.900
**LOL**
529.660
Because I checked
the Sheep and Wool Festival website,
532.371
532.538
and there's only 8,000 tickets left.
534.123
535.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
536.417
Okay. Sheldon, being physical with Amy
is a huge step for you.
539.962
# BERNADETTE
540.129
Yeah, are you ready for this?
541.464
# SHELDON
542.089
Intimacy in any form
has been challenging for me,
545.134
545.301
but I'd like to show her
how important she is,
547.511
547.678
and it feels like
now might be the right time.
550.056
# PENNY
550.306
Sheldon, that's so beautiful.
551.974
# SHELDON
552.475
Then it's settled.
553.642
553.809
Amy's birthday present
will be my genitals.
555.936
556.600
**LOL**
563.300
**LOL**
# AMY
563.694
Thanks for taking me out.
564.945
# PENNY
565.112
Well, you're spending
your birthday with Sheldon.
566.739
566.822
Why not celebrate early?
568.032
# BERNADETTE
568.199
So, where do you want to go?
569.283
# AMY
569.366
I heard that new Mexican place
on Greene Street is good.
571.994
# PENNY
572.161
Sure, sure.
573.537
573.704
Or we could take you to get a bikini wax.
575.998
576.900
**LOL**
# AMY
579.168
Why would I get a bikini wax
for my birthday?
581.837
# PENNY
582.088
I don't know.
It was just a thought.
584.423
# AMY
584.590
I think I'll just stick to Mexican.
586.133
586.900
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
587.134
Great.
588.135
588.302
And then, maybe after,
we can watch a dirty movie,
590.930
591.097
and if anybody has any questions
about what happened or how,
593.516
593.682
we can answer them.
594.767
595.300
**LOL**
# AMY
597.186
Okay, what is going on?
599.105
# PENNY
599.522
We just want you to be prepared
600.762
600.898
for any surprises
that might happen tomorrow.
603.526
# AMY
603.692
What surprises?
605.402
# BERNADETTE
608.197
We don't want to spoil anything,
611.158
611.325
but you should know that
Sheldon said he's ready to be physical.
614.537
# AMY
614.703
You shut your damn mouth!
616.122
616.400
**LOL**
621.335
You actually heard him say this?
623.379
# PENNY
623.546
Yes. He said he wants to do something
to show you how much you mean to him.
626.466

# AMY
627.800
I... I can't believe it. I...

Well, we're really happy for you,
and we know how much he cares
638.060

I suppose you're here
663.627

Sheldon,
if you're with the right person,
748.796
748.963
it'll be okay.
750.965
# SHELDON
753.968
Thank you, Arthur.
755.886
756.220
You are the wisest of the wise.
758.973
# ARTHUR
759.890
Well, that's...
That's very nice of you to say,
761.809
761.976
but I think I'm just an expression of...
764.645
764.812
Of your unconscious mind.
767.106
# SHELDON
767.564
Oh, sure.

# SHELDON
866.747
Hello.
867.373
867.539
Sorry I'm late.
868.582
868.749
I also got you a balloon,
870.459
870.626
but it floated away,
and I chased it for a while.
872.546
872.800
**LOL**
# AMY
873.921
That's okay. Come on in.
875.381
875.798
Thank you.

877.591
Um, I'll just... I'm gonna go
put these in water.
879.593
# SHELDON
879.760
Okay.
881.095
882.179
Oh! This is different.
883.764
884.098
Hmm. Candles and music.
886.016
# AMY
886.183
Do you like it?
887.184
# SHELDON
887.351
It's kind of spooky.
888.435
889.100
**LOL**
# AMY
890.062
I can change it back.
891.146
# SHELDON
891.313
No, no, no. It's your birthday.
892.815
892.981
And as long as no one jumps out
in a hockey mask, I'll be fine.
895.943

So...
902.449
904.159
What'd you have in mind for tonight?
905.828
# SHELDON
906.412
I thought I could take you out
to a nice birthday dinner.
909.206
909.373
Now, if we pick a place east of here,
we might find the balloon.
912.376
913.500
**LOL**
# AMY
914.128
Um, that sounds nice,
917.214
917.381
but I'm not really hungry right now.
920.008
920.175
I thought, maybe,
922.136
922.719
we could do presents first.
924.117
# SHELDON
924.117
Oh!
925.514
925.100
**LOL**
927.558
All right. Um...
929.184
931.186
I should probably tell you
something about this gift.
934.064
# AMY
934.731
You mean, before you...
937.651
939.153
Give it to me?

# SHELDON
944.283
Yes.

May I ask you a question before I...
949.830
950.205
Give it to you?

952.100
**LOL**
# AMY
953.709
Of course.
954.439
# SHELDON
954.439
Why are we saying
955.169
955.335
"give it to you" like that?

**LOL**
# AMY
958.630
Sheldon,
960.591
961.383
I know your present is
964.136
964.595
for us to be intimate tonight.
967.055
# SHELDON
968.182
I see.
969.850
970.767
Is that all right?
971.768
975.700
**LOL**
978.275
I'm sorry,
but this is a litigious society.
979.955
980.110
I'm gonna need verbal consent.

I don't know. He said he's ready.
1033.956
# BERNADETTE
1034.122
Yeah, but he also swore this was the year
1035.624
1035.707
he'd be able to
pull the guts out of a pumpkin.
1037.709
1038.300

# PENNY
1039.628
Yeah, well, I'm gonna stay positive.
1041.005
1041.088
I mean, we talked.
I told him what women like.
1042.882
1042.965
And after he stopped giggling,
he seemed pretty sure of himself.
