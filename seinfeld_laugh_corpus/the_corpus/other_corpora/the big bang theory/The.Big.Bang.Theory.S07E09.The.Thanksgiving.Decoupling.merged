The math is all there.

It's not real.

Yes, it is.

# SHELDON

Look.
It is scientifically impossible
10.391
10.558
for a person to tip a cow.
12.435
12.600
**LOL**
13.728
Even you, with your stocky build
15.188
15.355
and lumberjack shoulders,
you couldn't do it.
17.115
17.900
**LOL**
# RAJ
18.733
It's horrible. Why would you push
a cow over? They're sacred.
21.111
# PENNY
21.194
Oh, stop it.
22.278
22.445
I've seen you eat,
like, a million hamburgers.
24.280
# RAJ
24.447
Hey, an animal can be both
sacred and delicious.
27.116
27.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
28.284
Look, I'm telling you
I've done it, okay?
30.036
30.203
I clearly remember
the cow standing up
31.788
31.955
and then the cow on its side.
33.289
# LEONARD
33.456
Were you drunk?
35.250
# PENNY
35.416
I was 16 in Nebraska.
What do you think?
38.795
# LEONARD
38.962
I think you're the one who fell over.
41.714
41.600
**LOL**
# PENNY

That would explain why the sky
was also on its side.

I'm going to say... not.
52.350

That's just based on me
trying to roll
54.435

my mom over
when she's snoring.

57.939
Speaking of that big side of beef,
60.817
61.200
**LOL**
60.984
she's invited all of you
to Thanksgiving at her house.
64.279
# SHELDON
64.737
Mmm.
65.947
66.700
**LOL**
67.282
You know, I've been told
that a bald refusal
69.002
69.158
of an invitation is rude
and one must instead
71.327
71.494
offer up a polite excuse, so...
73.162
73.329
I'd love to go, but, unfortunately,
75.623
75.790
that sounds awful.

# HOWARD

We were actually
going to do it here.

# HOWARD
84.465
Please?
Bernadette's bringing her dad,
86.050
86.217
because her mom's out of town,
87.260
87.343
and I never have anything
to say to that guy.
89.304
# SHELDON
89.470
Since you put it that way,
I'd love to go,

97.854
Excuse me,
99.063
99.230
but every year
you prepare a terrible meal
101.941
102.108
and every year I criticize it.
104.068
104.235
Do our traditions
mean nothing to you?
106.571

Fine, I'll go.
113.995

And I expect you

# SHELDON
152.450
Now I know how the
African slaves felt.
155.703
156.100
**LOL**
157.288
Being dragged from their homes
158.706
158.873
to labor under the
yoke of the white man.
162.085

# AMY
162.251
Are you honestly comparing
Thanksgiving dinner
165.254
165.421
at Wolowitz's mom's with
one of the greatest tragedies
168.049
168.216
in the history of mankind?

Yes.

a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.
174.973

I spent one in Vegas.
176.349
# LEONARD
176.516
You did?
177.350
# PENNY
177.517
Yeah, back when I was dating Zack.
179.352
179.519
It was actually more fun
than I thought.
181.062
181.145
We gambled, we went to one
of those cheesy wedding chapels,
183.523
183.690
we had a really good
turkey dinner.
185.149
185.316
Which was surprising,
since we were at a strip club.
187.819

Wait, you went to a chapel?
191.239

Yeah.
192.011

192.011
Why?

Turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away.

272.236
How can
one little toe hurt so bad?

Maybe because that little piggy

# SHELDON
334.382
Oh! I have a reason.
336.384
336.800
**LOL**
336.551
It could be because
you said yes to marrying Zack,
339.262
339.428
but every time
Leonard's proposed,
340.930
341.097
he's gotten a resounding no.

That's just off the top of my head.

get an annulment,

It says here
you can get an annulment

if any of the following
conditions are met.

I'm trying to watch the game.
Shut up.
582.379
583.100
**LOL**
585.841
How do you not make
a first down there?
588.260
# SHELDON
588.427
They passed against
a nickel defense.
590.012
590.179
They should have run it off-tackle.
591.972
593.700
**LOL**
# MIKE
594.683
How the hell
do you know that?
596.435
# SHELDON
596.602
My father loved football.
598.062
598.229
He always made me watch it
599.814
599.980
before I was allowed
to do my homework.
601.565
# PENNY
601.732
Well...
603.400
602.500
**LOL**
603.609
You'll be happy to know
I just spoke to Zack
605.194
605.277
and he's willing to
sign the court papers.
606.863
606.946
He's on his way here now.
608.114
# LEONARD
608.280
Wait, you invited him here?
609.615
# PENNY
609.615
Yeah.
610.950
# MIKE
611.117
I'm getting ready
to weigh in again.
612.785
613.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
612.952
Come on.
614.078
# MIKE
615.538
What do you think
they ought to do now?
618.165
# SHELDON
618.332
I would throw a quick slant
to a wide-out,
620.459
620.626
given that the defense
is showing blitz.
622.920
# HOWARD
623.087
Oh, I love a good blitz,
especially with sour cream.
626.215
626.400
**LOL**
629.385
Get it?
630.386
630.553
Because it sounds like "blintz."
632.930
633.848
Did someone say blintz?
636.225
635.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
637.393
I just don't understand
638.352
638.519
why you invited him here today.
639.854
# PENNY
639.979
Because you wouldn't
shut up about it.
641.314
641.397
When I called him,
he had nothing to do,
642.607
642.690
so I just thought it would
643.566
# RAJ
643.649
Hey, guys, I'm trying
to cook in here.
645.276
# PENNY
645.442
Oh, sorry.
We'll keep it down.
646.610
# RAJ
646.777
No, no, speak up.
648.654
649.200
**LOL**
649.572
I'm about to use the blender,
650.823
650.990
and I don't want to miss anything.
652.783
652.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
653.617
Well, you might have
to cook for one more
655.536
655.703
because she invited Zack.

# RAJ
659.915
My, my

**LOL**
# SHELDON
669.675
I don't care for your
mother's bathroom.
671.760
671.927
There's not an angle
to do one's business
673.929
674.096
without a clown figurine
staring at you.
676.765
676.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
678.100
That's why I sit.
680.311
# MIKE
680.311
Yeah, that's why.
682.521
682.400
**LOL**
685.107
You remember
the Thanksgiving game
687.109
687.276
when it snowed in Dallas?
689.111
# SHELDON
689.278
Nineteen-ninety three. Leon Lett blew
the game in the final seconds
692.740
692.907
and the Dolphins
emerged victorious.
694.700
694.867
Then I finally got to do
my calculus.
697.703
697.500
**LOL**
# MIKE
697.870
I was so pissed,
I wanted to shoot my TV.
701.165
# SHELDON
701.332
So was my dad.
703.125
703.292
And then he did.
704.376
704.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
706.462
Anyone need a beer?
707.359
# MIKE
707.359
Yeah.
708.255
# HOWARD
708.422
Thank God.
709.840
709.800
**LOL**
# MIKE
710.799
So, does your dad
still live in Texas?
713.594
# SHELDON
713.761
No.
He died when I was 14.
716.347
# MIKE
717.556
I'm sorry to hear that.
719.391
# SHELDON
719.558
So was the man who owned
the local liquor store.
721.810
722.200
**LOL**
723.562
He cried and cried.
725.481
725.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
726.732
Here you go.
728.150
# MIKE
728.150
Thanks.
729.568
730.486
So, if your dad died
when you were 14,
733.155
733.322
you were never old enough
to have a beer with the man.
736.075
# SHELDON
736.492
No, sir.
737.493
737.743
He did try to give me one
for my high school graduation,
740.537
740.704
but I was 11 and my mom said, no.
742.915
743.800
**LOL**
# MIKE
748.170
Well, you're having one with me.
750.047
# SHELDON
755.344
All right.
756.345
# MIKE
758.597
To your dad.
760.266
# HOWARD
764.019
I never had a beer
with my dad, either.
767.481
767.500

Do you mind?
We're having a moment here.

I wonder what she saw in that guy.
785.374
# BERNADETTE
785.541
I don't know.
786.875
787.042
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.
788.877
# AMY
789.044
Broad shoulders, good hair.
790.587
# RAJ
790.713
Hmm, wonder what she
sees in Leonard.
792.631
793.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
796.635
How's it going out there?
797.928
# HOWARD
798.095
Sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me.
801.473
# AMY
801.849
I know how you feel.
803.767
803.934
Sheldon ignored me for a week
when he got that Roomba vacuum.
807.229
807.300
**LOL**
809.189
I kick it when he's not looking.
811.317
811.600
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
813.569
What are they doing?
814.570
# HOWARD
814.862
They're drinking beer
and watching football.
817.323
# BERNADETTE
817.489
So why don't you do that
with them?
819.116
# HOWARD
819.325
They don't want me.
820.472
# BERNADETTE
820.472
What do you mean?
821.618
# HOWARD
823.287
Well, Sheldon started talking
about how his dad isn't alive anymore,
825.498
825.581
and they were toasting,
and I tried to tell them
826.958
827.041
about how sad I was
when my dad abandoned
828.751
# AMY
828.834
Zack's here!
830.085

Stir the gravy.
832.880
# BERNADETTE
835.466
Sorry. I really want
to hear how sad you are.
837.468
837.634
I'll be back in, like, five, ten minutes.
839.636
841.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
844.350
Sorry she made you come
over here on a holiday.
846.477
# ZACK
846.643
It's all right.
I didn't have anything going on.
848.562
848.729
Plus, Penny told me we're married,
850.147
850.314
and Thanksgiving's a time
to be with family.
852.858
852.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
853.817
Yeah, okay great.
854.860
854.985
Can we just get this over with?
855.903
# LEONARD
855.986
Yeah, you guys
have to sign here and here.
859.198
859.365
On Monday,
we'll file for the annulment,
861.033
861.200
and this "marriage" will be over.
862.701
# PENNY
862.868
Okay.
863.911
# ZACK
865.204
I don't know if I want to sign it.
866.705
866.914
Ooh!

869.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
870.876
Why won't you sign it?
872.127

I just think splitting up
can be rough on kids.
875.547
876.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
876.924
We don't have any kids.
878.008
# ZACK
878.175
Are you sure?
Because you didn't know
879.635
879.802
we were married
until this morning.
881.553
882.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
883.806
Okay, look, Zack, come on.
885.140
885.307
You know neither of us
thought this was real.
887.309
887.476
I mean, we were married
by an Elvis impersonator.
889.561
# ZACK
889.770
Of course it was an impersonator.
891.090
891.188
We could never afford
a real Elvis.
893.899

**LOL**
# LEONARD
897.069
You married him instead of me?
899.279

901.240
Sign the papers.
902.658
# PENNY
902.825
Hang on.
You know what?
903.951
904.118
You have been a jerk
about this all day.
905.828
905.994
You always do this!
Whenever I mess up,
907.413
907.496
you're right there to make me
feel even worse about it.
909.415
# LEONARD
909.498
That is not true.
910.416
# PENNY
910.582
We could've waited till Monday,
911.667
911.750
signed the papers,
this all would have been over.
913.210
# LEONARD
913.293
You're the one who
invited him here.
914.711
# PENNY
914.878
There you go again.
Just another mistake
916.004
916.046
you're throwing in my face.

# ZACK
917.506
Not cool, bro.
919.258
919.800
**LOL**
921.051
I'm starting to think
922.344
922.511
you're not the kind of guy
I want dating my wife.
925.013
925.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
928.058
Yeah, well, she's not going to
be your wife for long.

Oh, no.
Are you dying?

Let's eat.

All I know is you can
only fit one of her in a car.

that came out of her.

I really didn't want
to come here,

# SHELDON
1022.486
Perhaps you're right.
1023.862
1026.365
I'm sorry for my behavior.
1027.658
1027.824
I've had alcohol,

it won't be a joke.
