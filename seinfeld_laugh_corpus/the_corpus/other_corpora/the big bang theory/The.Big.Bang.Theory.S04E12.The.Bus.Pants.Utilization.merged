Ma, Ma, calm down. Listen to me.
I know it says click with the mouse...
7.717
7.883
...but on a laptop,
the trackpad is the mouse.
11.178

Now, put your finger on it.
No, doesn't matter which finger.

17.852
Good choice.
19.270
19.437
Yeah, now move it down
to your e-mail icon.
22.231
22.398
Yeah, the little envelope.
24.942
25.109
What do you mean what does it
look like? It looks like an envelope!

27.900

Fine, you don't like the computer,
don't use it.

# SHELDON
42.168
Yeah, I won't say that all senior citizens
who can't master technology...
46.255
46.422
...should be publicly flogged, but if
we made an example of one or two...
50.259
49.300

incentive to try harder.

# LEONARD

I had a great idea.
You know how we're always having...
57.683
57.892
...to stop
and solve differential equations...
60.019
60.186
...like when you do Fourier analysis
or using the Schrodinger equation?
63.731

63.898
Howard doesn't. He's only an engineer.
65.733

# LEONARD
67.526
I think we could write a little app that
would use handwriting recognition...
71.739
72.400
**LOL**
71.906
...then run it through
a symbolic evaluation engine.
74.408

You just use your smartphone,
take a picture of the equation, and barn!

You know what's a great app?
The one that makes fart noises.

You know, Leonard,
that's actually a valid idea. Very good.

Can you say that

# SHELDON
98.808
No. The two achievements
are equally surprising...
101.977
100.100
**LOL**
102.144
...and equally admirable.
103.479

Though if pressed,
I'd have to give a slight edge to the cat.

I'll save you the pain and nervousness

# HOWARD
122.832
A few extra bucks would be nice.
124.375

I always dreamed about building
a little place of my own over the garage.

You know, if I made more money,
I could take time off...
134.885

...and give pretty girls
submarine rides.

137.805
What's that, some weird sex thing?
140.808

No. You take girls underwater
in your private submarine...
144.478
144.645
...and you show them fish.

I think we could work on this at night

Was that the best 99 cents I ever spent
or what?

# LEONARD
195.446
I checked the App Store.

Whatever your secret is, I'm sure

243.953
Well, it's not boring at all.
You see, in higher-order mathematics...
247.456
247.623
...there are certain sets of equations--

Satisfied?

Hardly.

Consider this unlikely
but very plausible scenario.
255.923

A young woman alone in the big city.
258.759
258.926
Her ridiculous dream
of becoming an actress...

Hang on, let's see where he's going.

**LOL**
# SHELDON
266.725
Then it hits her,
how is she going to survive?
269.562
269.728
But she has no prospects,
no marketable skills.
273.274
273.600
**LOL**
273.440
And then one day,
she meets a group of geniuses...

She befriends them, and then lies in wait

and sells to the highest bidder.

421.255

new values for the coefficients.

Well, I assume
you were opening with a joke.

It's not a joke. It's the real design.

Oh, I'm sorry.
I assumed that you wanted...
453.120
453.287
...candid truth-telling
from your employees.
455.330
455.497
But I realize now,
you want the mindless nattering...

Why?

Because you're impossible

Nothing's changed in that regard.
We're still roommates, still friends.

Except you identified me,
your best friend...
631.632
631.798
...as a gangrenous limb...
633.133
633.300
...that needed to be severed
from the organism and tossed.
636.136
636.900

Mm, last night, I had a dream
we got so rich from the app...
657.157
657.324
...you and I bought
matching side-by-side mansions.
659.952
660.700

But there was a secret tunnel...

...connecting your front yard
to my back yard.

668.900
**LOL**

704.913
Oh, I'm sorry,
I typed that into the label maker...

...but I just couldn't press enter.
Now down to business.
711.211
709.400

711.378
What would it take
for you to abandon Leonard...
713.880
714.400
**LOL**
714.047
...and join me in a rival company?
715.882
716.049
Unless, of course, mugs are sufficient.

In which case, welcome aboard.

# SHELDON
783.825
A combination of all your names.
Very clever.

the install time problem?

# SHELDON
823.323
Playing it.
824.991
824.600
**LOL**
825.992
I've loved the theremin from the moment
I heard original Star Trek theme.
829.996

And it's been killing me that
it just sits in my closet gathering dust.

No, that was completely called for.
We need quiet.
867.909
# SHELDON
868.076
So your project
is more important than mine?
870.245
# LEONARD
870.412
Well, seeing as your project
is to sabotage my project, yes.
873.915
# SHELDON
874.082
Don't beat around the bush, Leonard.

875.917
If you don't want me here,
just say the word and I'll leave.

ls it better than your idea...

...to move to Los Angeles
and become a famous actress?

...you snap a picture
and the app goes on the Internet...
966.341
966.508
...to find out where you can buy them.

Oh, Penny, where do I begin?
977.519
977.686
The simple-mindedness of your idea...
979.479
979.646
...is exceeded only by
its crass consumerism and banality.
983.525
# PENNY
983.775
And Leonard didn't wanna
work with you, imagine that.

Based on the fact that
our potential market...
1034.242
1034.451
...is about 70 or 80 guys,
and you want a submarine...
1037.203
1037.370
...I'd say about a million dollars a pop.

Never mind, stupid question.

Can't you just let him play

We're not playing. This is real work.

We're gonna be hundredaires.
1066.399
1067.000

Okay, what if I got him to apologize
and promise to behave?
1070.403
1072.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
1073.698
Then I guess we would let him
back on the app team.
1076.117
1076.284
While we're doing that, you could take
an aerial tour of L.A. on your flying pig.

1123.164
1122.700
**LOL**
1123.331
The thing is...
1124.457
1124.624
...you're gonna have to offer him
a face-saving way out of this.
1127.961
# SHELDON
1128.586
How?
1129.462
# PENNY
1129.462

No.
1142.642

# PENNY
1146.438
Oh, good for you.
1147.814

All you have to do
is say you're sorry to Leonard...
1150.608
1150.775
...but say it sarcastically.
1152.527
# SHELDON
1152.694
Of course.
1154.654
1154.821
He will hear it
as an attempt to mend fences...
1157.282
1157.449
...as opposed to the withering
condemnation you and I know it to be.
1161.828
1161.900

Yeah, that was my plan.
