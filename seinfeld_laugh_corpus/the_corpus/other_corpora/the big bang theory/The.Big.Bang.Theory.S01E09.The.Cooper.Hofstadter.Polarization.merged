Gentlemen, I am now about to send a signal
from this laptop through our local ISP...
13.472
13.639
...racing down fiber-optic cable
at the speed of light to San Francisco...
17.101
17.268
...bouncing off a satellite in
geosynchronous orbit to Lisbon, Portugal.
20.605
20.771
Data packets will be handed off
to submerged transatlantic cables...
23.899
24.066
...terminating in Halifax, Nova Scotia...
25.985
26.300
**LOL**
26.152
...and transferred across the continent
via microwave relays back to our ISP...
29.822
29.500
**LOL**
29.989
...and the external receiver attached
to this...
32.199
33.200
...lamp.
34.619

Look at me, look at me,
I've got goose bumps.

Are we ready on the stereo?

# RAJ
40.875
Go for stereo.
42.335

Hey, guys.
LEONARD &

65.233
Hello.
66.567
# PENNY
66.901
It's a little loud.
68.194
# HOWARD
68.361
No problem. Turning it down.
70.571
70.738
San Francisco, Lisbon,
73.908
74.075
Voilֳ .
75.493

**LOL**
# PENNY
75.660
Okay, thanks.
76.702
# LEONARD
76.869
Hang on, hang on.
Do you not realize what we just did?
79.372
# PENNY
79.622
Yeah, you turned your stereo down
with your laptop.
81.957
# SHELDON
82.124
No, we turned our stereo down by sending
a signal around the world via the Internet.
87.046
# PENNY
87.254
Oh. Get one of those
universal remotes at RadioShack.
90.383
90.549
They're really cheap.
92.134

No. You don't get it.

Boy, that's terrific, but I'll see you.

No, hang on.
104.647

# SHELDON
111.946
Someone in Sichuan Province, China...
114.240

114.407
...is using his computer
to turn our lights on and off.
118.160

**LOL**
# PENNY
118.703
Huh. Well, that's handy.
120.663
121.831
Um, here's a question. Why?
123.791
# ALLTOGETHER
125.376
Because we can.
127.044
127.200
**LOL**
# SHELDON
127.795
Oh! They found the remote-control cars.
130.172
131.700

# PENNY
133.426
But wait, wait, what's on top of them?

Wireless webcams. Wave hello.

# HOWARD
137.638
The monster truck
is out of Austin, Texas...
140.307

...and the blue Viper is being operated
from suburban Tel Aviv.
144.353

You may wanna put on slacks.
148.691

148.858
What?
150.151
150.300

152.027
Ew! Stop it. No. Leave me alone.
156.198

**LOL**
# LEONARD
158.659
Who's running the red Corvette?
160.244

That would be me.

You know, in the future,
when we're disembodied brains in jars...
189.774
189.940
...we're going to look back on this
as eight hours well wasted.
193.486
193.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
194.528
I don't wanna be in a jar.
I want my brain in an android body.

Eight feet tall and ripped.
201.702
201.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
202.578
I'm with you. I just have to make sure if
I'm a synthetic human, I'd still be Jewish.
206.957
207.200
**LOL**
208.834
I promised my mother.
210.669
210.700
**LOL**
# RAJ
212.463
I suppose you could have
your android penis circumcised.
216.842
216.400
**LOL**
217.885
That's something your rabbi would have
to discuss with the manufacturer.
221.222
220.800
**LOL**
# SHELDON
221.680
Not to mention
you'd have to power down on Saturdays.
225.059
224.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
226.560
Sheldon, why is this letter in the trash?
228.562
# SHELDON
228.729
Well, there's always the possibility...
230.564
230.731
...that a trash can spontaneously
formed around the letter...
233.567
234.193
...but Ockham's Razor would suggest
that someone threw it out.
237.613
238.100
**LOL**
# LEONARD
237.780
It's from the Institute
for Experimental Physics.
240.074
240.241
They want us to present our
paper on the properties of supersolids...
243.410
243.577
...at the Topical Conference
on Bose-Einstein Condensates.
246.247
# SHELDON
246.413
I know. I read it before I threw it out.
249.416
# LEONARD
249.583
Okay, if I may drill down
to the bedrock of my question...
252.378
252.545
...why did you throw it out?
253.838
# SHELDON
254.004
Because I have no interest in standing in
the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott...
257.883
258.050
...in front of a group
of judgmental strangers...
260.302
260.469
...who wouldn't recognize genius if it were
standing in front of them giving a speech.
264.557
264.723
Which, if I were there, it would be.
267.184
266.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
267.893
I don't know, Sheldon.
268.936
269.103
Those Topical Conference on Bose-Einstein
Condensates parties are legendary.
272.898
272.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
273.065
Forget the parties.
274.400
# HOWARD
274.567
Forget the parties? What a nerd.
277.528
276.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
278.362
Any other honors I've gotten
that I don't know about?
280.948
281.115
Did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize
with my name on it?
284.076
# SHELDON
284.243
Leonard, don't take this the wrong way,
but the day you win a Nobel Prize...
287.746
287.913
...is the day I begin my research on the drag
coefficient of tassels on flying carpets.
292.543
292.200
**LOL**
# RAJ
293.210
Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing from
that insult was your mama.
297.131
297.300
**LOL**
# HOWARD
298.048
I got one. Hey, Leonard, your mama's
research methodology is so flawed
301.385
# LEONARD
301.552
Shut up, Howard.
303.304
302.400
**LOL**
303.804
Sheldon, we have to do this.
304.930
# SHELDON
304.930
No, we don't.
306.056
306.223
We have to take in nourishment,
expel waste...
308.434
308.601
...and inhale enough oxygen
to keep our cells from dying.
311.228
311.395
Everything else is optional.
313.397
313.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
313.564
Okay, let me put it this
314.606
314.606
I'm doing it.
315.649
# SHELDON
315.816
You can't. I'm the lead author.
317.902
# LEONARD
318.068
Come on, the only reason you're the lead
author is because we went alphabetically.
321.864
# SHELDON
322.031
I let you think we went alphabetically...
323.949
324.116
...to spare you dealing
with the fact that it was my idea.
326.911
327.077
Not to put too fine a point on it,
but I was throwing you a bone.
330.581
330.400
**LOL**
330.998
You're welcome.
332.333
# LEONARD
332.499
Excuse me, I designed the experiment
that proved the hypothesis.
335.920
# SHELDON
336.086
It doesn't need proving.
337.504
# LEONARD
337.671
So the entire scientific community
is just supposed to just take your word?
341.425
# SHELDON
341.592
They're not supposed to,
but they should.
344.345
343.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
344.511
I don't care what you say.
345.721
345.888
I'm going to the conference,
presenting our findings.
348.349
# SHELDON
348.515
And I forbid it.
349.683
# LEONARD
351.226
You forbid it?
352.436
# SHELDON
352.603
If I'm not taking credit for our work,
then nobody is.
355.481
# LEONARD
355.648
So you admit that it's our work?
357.942
# SHELDON
357.942
No, once again, I'm throwing you a bone.
360.235
360.402
And once again, you are welcome.
363.030
362.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
# HOWARD
365.991
Oh, no, he didn't.
368.327
368.100
**LOL**
# PENNY
371.246
So how's it going with Sheldon?
Are you guys still not talking?
374.375
# LEONARD
374.541
Not only is he still not talking to me,
but he does this thing...
377.544
377.711
...where he stares at you
and tries to get your brain to explode.
380.714
380.400
**LOL**
381.966
You know,
like in the classic sci-fi movie Scanners?
385.511
385.678
Bzz-phew!
387.012
387.700
**LOL**
388.764
Never mind.
389.807
390.265
How about this one?
392.142
392.309
It says, "I know my physics,
but I'm still a fun guy."
395.312
395.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
395.479
Oh.
396.563
396.730
Oh, I didn't know
they still made corduroy suits.
399.608
# LEONARD
399.775
They don't. That's why I saved this one.
402.361
402.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
402.820
Okay, well,
let's just see what else you have.
406.156
406.323
Okay, here.
Take this and this and this...
411.370
411.537
...and these.
412.767
# LEONARD
412.767
ls this stuff you want me to try on?
413.998
# PENNY
414.164
No, this is stuff I want you to throw out.
416.875
416.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
# PENNY
417.042
Seriously, don't even give it to charity.
You won't be helping anyone.
421.046
420.300
**LOL**
421.505
What's this?
423.298
# LEONARD
423.465
That's the Bottle City of Kandor.
425.926
427.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
426.927
Uh-huh.
427.928
# LEONARD
428.762
You see, Kandor was the capital city
of the planet Krypton.
432.725
432.891
It was miniaturized by Brainiac
before Krypton exploded...
435.561
435.728
...and then rescued by Superman.
437.521
437.700
**LOL**
# PENNY
438.689
Oh, nice.
441.150
# LEONARD
441.817
It's a lot cooler
when girls aren't looking at it.
444.445
444.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
445.612
Here, why don't you put these on
while I find a shirt and sport coat?
448.866
# LEONARD
449.033
Great, be right back.
450.368
# PENNY
450.368
Where are you going? Put them on.
451.702
# LEONARD
451.869
Here?
453.287
# PENNY
453.287
Oh, are you shy?
454.705
# LEONARD
454.872
No, I'm not shy.
455.998
# PENNY
455.998
Don't worry, I won't look.
457.124
# LEONARD
457.291
I know you won't. Why would you look?
There's nothing to see. Not noth
460.627
# PENNY
460.794
Sweetie, put the pants on.
462.192
461.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
462.192
I'm gonna put them on.
463.589
# PENNY
464.715
So, you know, isn't there some way
you and Sheldon could compromise...
468.010
468.177
...on this presentation thing?
469.595
# LEONARD
469.762
No, no. Scientists do not compromise.
472.473
472.639
Our minds are trained to synthesize facts
and come to inarguable conclusions.
476.477
476.977
Not to mention,
Sheldon is bat-crap crazy.
480.856
480.400
**LOL**
# PENNY
483.025
What is this?
484.485
# LEONARD
484.651
Oh, careful.
486.779
485.500
**LOL**
487.154
That's my original series
Battlestar Galactica flight suit.
489.823
490.500
**LOL**
# PENNY
491.033
Oh, why didn't you wear it
on Halloween?
493.160
# LEONARD
493.327
Because it's not a costume.
It's a flight suit.
496.413
496.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
498.957
Okay, all right. Moving on.
500.918
501.085
Oh, wow, a paisley shirt.
503.253
# LEONARD
503.420
Uh-huh, it goes with my corduroy suit.
505.255
505.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
506.465
If you mean it should end up
in the same place, then I agree.
510.427
510.000
**LOL**
510.844
Is this your only tie?
513.263
# LEONARD
513.430
Ah, technically, yes.
515.224
515.390
But if you'll notice, it's reversible.
520.020
520.100
**LOL**
521.605
So it works as two.
522.981
# PENNY
523.440
Oh, sweetie,
I don't even think it works as one.
525.776
526.200
**LOL**
527.694
Is this all your clothes?
529.425
# LEONARD
529.425
Yup, everything since the eighth grade.
531.156
# PENNY
531.865
The eighth grade?
533.325
# LEONARD
533.492
My last growth spurt.
535.285
535.800
**LOL**
# PENNY
537.079
Okay, well,
guess we're back to the corduroy suit.
539.706
# LEONARD
539.873
Great.
540.957
# PENNY
540.957
Yup.
542.042
543.585
I said no. Put it down.
545.629
545.400
**LOL**
# PENNY

Hey, Sheldon.
553.303

Hello, Penny.
555.556
# PENNY
556.306
Get anything good?
558.392
# SHELDON
559.893
Just the latest copy
of Applied Particle Physics Quarterly.
562.980

563.397
Oh, you know, that is so weird
that yours came and mine didn't.
567.484
569.700
**LOL**
572.447
It was a joke.
573.532
574.908
Heh-heh.
576.201
576.400
**LOL**
578.328
Yup. Tip your waitresses.
I'm here all week.
582.374
583.300
**LOL**
# SHELDON
583.792
To save you from further awkwardness...
585.627
585.794
...know that I'm comfortable with the two
of us climbing the stairs in silence.
589.590
# PENNY
589.756
Oh, yeah, okay, me too. Zip it, lock it.
592.050
595.053
Put it in your pocket.
596.847
597.200
**LOL**
600.767
So you and Leonard--
602.206
# SHELDON
602.206
Oh, dear God.
603.645
603.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
603.979
Little misunderstanding, huh?
605.731
# SHELDON
605.898
A little misunderstand--?
607.316
607.482
Galileo and the pope
had a little misunderstanding.
611.403
610.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
614.239
Anyway, I was talking
to Leonard this morning...
616.366
616.533
...and I think he feels
really bad about it.
618.785
# SHELDON
619.119
Huh.
620.287
# PENNY
620.454
Well, how do you feel?
622.623
# SHELDON
623.123
I don't understand the question.
625.417
625.300
**LOL**
# PENNY
626.043
Well, I'm just asking if it's difficult
to be fighting with your best friend.
629.838
# SHELDON
630.005
Oh, I hadn't thought about it like that.
632.799
632.966
I wonder if I've been experiencing
physiological manifestations...
636.011
636.178
...of some sort
of unconscious emotional turmoil.
639.514
639.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
639.932
Wait, what?
640.974
# SHELDON
641.141
I couldn't poop this morning.
643.644
643.000
**LOL**
# PENNY
647.522
You should just talk to him.
I'm sure you guys can work this out.
650.567
# SHELDON
650.734
It's certainly preferable to my plan.
652.277
# PENNY
652.277
Which was?
653.820
# SHELDON
653.987
A powerful laxative.
656.156
655.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
657.532
Okay, so you absolutely
should talk to him.
659.493
659.660
I know Leonard values you as a friend.
661.453
661.620
He told me without your little idea...
663.497
663.664
...there was no way he could've come up
with this whole experiment thing.
667.125
667.100
**LOL**
# SHELDON
670.337
Excuse me. Little idea?
672.005
# PENNY
672.172
Yeah, he tried to explain it to me.
I didn't really understand it
675.217
# SHELDON
675.384
Of course you didn't.
He said "little idea"?
678.345
677.900
**LOL**
# PENNY
678.512
Oh. Well, no.
I mean, not in those words
681.556
# SHELDON
681.723
In what words, then, exactly?
683.600
# PENNY
683.767
The exact words aren't really
685.269
685.435
It's more the spirit in which--
686.624
# SHELDON
686.624
What did he say?
687.813
# PENNY
687.980
You had a lucky hunch.
689.273
689.900
**LOL**
690.691
I've been thinking.
Instead of arguing about this, why--?
693.443
# SHELDON
693.610
Don't you ever speak to me again.
696.154
# LEONARD
697.864
What--?
699.408
# PENNY
701.034
Oh, he:
703.161
703.500
**LOL**
712.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
714.589
Okay, I'm leaving for the conference.
716.967
# SHELDON
717.134
Have fun presenting my "lucky hunch."
719.219
# LEONARD
719.219
Sheldon, I didn't mean it like that.
721.305
# SHELDON
721.471
Why did you say it?
722.284
# LEONARD
722.284
I don't know
723.098
# SHELDON
723.265
Were you trying to impress Penny?
724.662
# LEONARD
724.662
No, no, not at all.
726.059
726.226
A little bit.
727.728
727.700
**LOL**
# SHELDON
728.228
How did that work out for you?
730.063
730.230
Leonard, ready to go?
731.481
# SHELDON
731.648
Libido, one. Truth, zero.
734.943
734.500
**LOL**
# LEONARD
736.695
I'm gonna ask one more time.
737.988
738.155
We did the work together,
let's present the paper together.
740.866
# SHELDON
741.033
And I'm telling you for the last time, it's
pandering, it's undignified, and bite me.
745.954
745.900
**LOL**
# LEONARD
747.831
Let's go.
749.082
# PENNY
749.249
Bye, Sheldon.
750.208
# SHELDON
750.208
Goodbye, Penny.
751.168
755.600
**LOL**
762.179
One of these
763.284
763.284
Phew!
764.389
764.600
**LOL**
# PENNY
767.392
There you go.
768.435
# LEONARD
768.602
You're right, this side does look better.
770.479
# PENNY
770.645
No, no, I didn't say better,
I said less stained.
773.940
773.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
775.233
I just checked the house.
There's probably 20, 25 people in there.
778.320
# LEONARD
778.487
You're kidding.
779.216
# PENNY
779.216
ls that all?
779.946
# LEONARD
780.113
All? In particle physics, 25 is Woodstock.
784.117
784.200
**LOL**
# PENNY
785.077
Oh. Well, then, good.
787.704
# LEONARD
787.871
I wasn't expecting such a crowd.
I'm nervous.
790.040
# HOWARD
790.207
It's okay. Open with a joke, you'll be fine.
792.375
# LEONARD
792.375
Okay, joke. Okay.
794.544
795.670
How about this? Urn, okay.
797.130
797.297
There's this farmer,
and he has these chickens...
800.467
800.634
...but they won't lay any eggs.
802.135
802.302
So he calls a physicist to help.
804.971
805.138
The physicist then does some calculations
and he
810.185
810.352
"I have a solution, but it only works
for spherical chickens in a vacuum."
815.982
818.500
**LOL**
818.777
Right?
819.820
# PENNY
823.990
Oh, sorry, I just-- I've heard it before.
826.493
826.700
**LOL**
# HOWARD
827.411
Let's roll.
827.932
827.932
Okay.
828.453
828.620
Hey, nice suit.
829.955
830.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
829.955
It's a classic, right?
831.289
# PENNY
831.832
I really should've brought my own car.
835.085
835.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
836.837
So in conclusion, the data show that at
temperatures approaching absolute zero...
841.216
841.383
...the moment of inertia changes
and the solid becomes a supersolid...
844.845
845.011
...which clearly appears to be a previously
unknown state of matter.
849.850
852.060
Thank you.
853.645
854.700
**LOL**
858.233
Are there any questions?
859.130
# VOICE
859.130
Yeah.
860.026
860.485
What the hell was that?
862.737
862.400
**LOL**
# LEONARD
864.865
Any other questions?
866.074
866.600
**LOL**
866.616
Dr. Sheldon Cooper here. I am the
lead author of this particular paper.
870.787
872.831
Thank you.
874.499
874.300
**LOL**
875.542
And you, sir, you have completely
skipped over the part...
878.211
878.378
...where I was walking through
the park...
880.297
880.464
...and I saw these children
on a merry-go-round...
882.716
882.883
...which started me thinking
about the moment of inertia...
885.594
885.760
...in gasses like helium at temperatures
approaching absolute zero.
888.847
# LEONARD
889.014
I didn't skip it.
It's just an anecdote. It's not science.
891.683
# SHELDON
891.850
Oh, I see. It was the apple falling
on Newton's head.
894.853
895.020
Was that just an anecdote?
896.271
# LEONARD
896.438
You are not Isaac Newton.
897.543
# SHELDON
897.543
No, no, that's true.
898.648
898.815
Gravity would have been apparent to me
without the apple.
901.568
901.300
**LOL**
# LEONARD
901.735
You cannot be that arrogant.
903.320
# SHELDON
903.487
You continue to underestimate me,
my good man.
906.114
906.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
906.281
If you weren't happy with my presentation,
then maybe you should've given it with me.
910.243
# SHELDON
910.410
As I've explained repeatedly, unlike you,
I don't need validation from lesser minds.
914.623
914.789
No offense.
915.957
916.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
915.957
Really? So why did you come?
917.125
# SHELDON
917.292
Because I knew you'd screw this up.
918.648
# LEONARD
918.648
I didn't screw it up.
920.003
# SHELDON
920.170
Oh, please. I admit,
that spherical-chicken joke was hilarious.
923.340
923.507
Thank you.
924.633
924.500
**LOL**
924.633
It was straight downhill from there.
925.759
# LEONARD
925.926
I've had enough of your condescension.
927.886
928.053
Maybe I didn't go to college
when I was 11, like you.
930.764
930.931
Maybe I got my doctorate at 24
instead of 16.
934.267
934.434
But you are not the only person who
is smarter than everyone else in this room.
938.438
938.939
No offense.
940.941
940.700
**LOL**
941.149
And I am clearly not the only person
who is tormented by insecurity...
945.111
945.278
...and has an ego
in need of constant validation.
947.531
# SHELDON
947.697
So you admit you're an egotist.
949.157
# LEONARD
949.157
Yes.
950.617
951.493
My name is Dr. Leonard Hofstadter.
I could never please my parents...
954.704
954.871
...so I need to get my self-esteem
from strangers.
957.123
957.290
But he's worse!
958.375
# SHELDON
958.542
Okay, that is it.
960.085
# LEONARD
960.252
Stop it.
961.962
961.700
**LOL**
963.797
You cannot blow up my head
with your mind.
966.341
# SHELDON
966.508
Then I'll settle for an aneurism.
968.468
968.900
**LOL**
968.635
Stop it.
969.511
# SHELDON
969.511
You hit me.
970.387
970.554
You saw that. He hit me.
971.805
# LEONARD
971.972
You tried to blow up my head.
973.139
# SHELDON
973.139
So it was working.
974.307
# LEONARD
974.474
It wasn't-- It was not--
You are a nutcase.
976.560
# SHELDON
976.726
We'll see. Heads up, you people
in the front row. This is a splash zone.
980.063

Stop it. Stop it.

Quit it.

You're lucky I didn't run you over.

# SHELDON
1016.182
I don't understand
what you're unhappy about.
1018.268
1018.435
You begged me to come, I came.
There's just no pleasing you.
1021.938

1022.105
You're right. I'm the problem,
the one that needs help.
1024.733
# SHELDON
1024.899
Well, that's not much of an apology,
but I'll take it.

**LOL**
# LEONARD
1028.194
Excuse me.
1030.196

Is there anything you'd like
to apologize for?
1033.283
# SHELDON
1034.200
Yes. Ahem.

1035.785
I'm sorry I tried to blow up your head.
1038.705
1038.900
