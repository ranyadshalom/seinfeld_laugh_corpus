Wow!

49.597
I'm not going to bother him,
I'm going to talk to him.

He thinks there's a difference.

# SHELDON
119.834
No, no, no. I'm really good at this.
All right, give me a hint.
121.920
122.003
Does it involve difficulty initiating
a stream of anything?
126.007
126.500
**LOL**

127.884
Well, given my age,
that's more than just a lucky guess.

Hey, Sheldon,
let's go mock the people

There's a new sports bar

# RAJ
187.443
You think they came up with that?
189.153

They were going
to drink beer and play darts.
192.782
# LEONARD

What's up?

195.618
Not his testosterone levels.

Excuse me. I happen to be very

He's working on a paper
about nano vacuum tubes,

and wants to know
if I'd take a look at it.
217.265
# SHELDON
218.224
That's strange,
219.600
219.767
that he would come to you
for that and not me.
222.061
222.900
**LOL**
223.813
Oh, I got two emails from him.
225.356
226.899
"Do you have Leonard's
email address?"
229.694
229.400

233.448
"Never mind, I found it."

And to think I idolized that man.
260.349
260.516
And Why?
262.018
262.185
At the end of the day he's just
another Hollywood phony.
264.937

**LOL**
# AMY

Is it really worth
getting upset about?
268.441
# SHELDON
268.608
They say don't meet your heroes.
270.193
270.359
Don't peek behind
that curtain of fame and celebrity,
273.154
273.321
because if you do,
you'll see them as they really
276.199
276.365
degenerate carnival folk.
278.242
278.700
**LOL**
# AMY
280.286
Come on,
he's a retired kids show host.
282.288
# SHELDON
282.455
That's even worse.
Using the sweet candy of science
285.666
285.833
to trick children into loving him.
287.752
289.253
Pervert.
290.463
291.000

# AMY
293.216
Have you thought about why Arthur
didn't want you to read his paper?
296.844
# SHELDON
297.011
Yes, I have.
298.387
298.554
And my only conclusion is the
prescription he was picking up
301.182
301.349
the other day was for cuckoo pills.
303.309
303.500
**LOL**
# AMY

Maybe he found you a bit much.

That's kind of a stretch.

There's the friendly chuckle.
320.618

From what I saw the other day,

some people might find you...

Doesn't matter.

No, go ahead, say it.
349.146
349.313
I know what it is.
I've heard it my whole life.
351.899
352.066
The word's "annoying".

So I won't be making fun of you,

You know, instead of beads and glue,
437.360
437.526
you guys can use my soldering iron.
438.926

You'd be able to make
much cooler stuff.

# SHELDON
521.652
Well, then, I'll make this quick.
523.946
524.113
I want to talk about the paper
you sent Leonard.
526.741
526.907
Now, I know he said it's promising
528.267
528.492
and he's going to collaborate on it,
530.202
530.411
but now that you and I are friends
again, I am at your disposal.
534.290
534.457
And, frankly, lending my name
536.125
536.292
and reputation to it will help,
because a lot of people think
538.919
539.086
that you're a washed-up has-been.
541.797
541.964
Or dead.

# SHELDON
554.727
It's because I'm annoying, right?

# BILL
651.699
What are you guys working on?
653.075
# LEONARD
653.242
Oh, we're making nano vacuum tubes.
656.245
# BILL
656.954
That's interesting.
658.268
# ARTHUR
658.268
Haven't you stolen enough from me?
659.582
659.748
Back off, bow tie!
661.876

Hey, guys, what do you think?
670.092
# AMY
670.926
Wow, Penny, good job.
672.386
# PENNY
672.553
Thanks. Target, 4.99.
I'm getting a drink.
675.264
675.300
**LOL**
# AMY
677.224
What are you working on?
678.580
# RAJ
678.580
I'm making a necklace for my mom.
679.935
# AMY
680.102
That's sweet.
681.103
# RAJ
681.270
Yeah, she and my dad are
going through a bit of a rough patch,
683.397
683.480
so I wanted to do something to let
her know I was thinking about her.
685.983
# PENNY
686.066
What's going on with them?
687.193
# RAJ
687.359
They're just having
a little trouble communicating.
689.778
689.945
My dad says it's because
the sound of my mom's voice
692.114
692.281
makes him want to tear his ears off
and sew them over his eyes
694.367
694.450
so he never has to look at her again.
695.930
696.500
**LOL**

700.247
Look who's here to put
the "Jew" in "Jewelry Night."

# BERNADETTE
706.879
Oh, sure,
so it's fine when you say it.
709.173

**LOL**
# HOWARD
710.633
Sorry we're late.
I wanted to swing by the lab
712.301
712.384
and pick up some even
cooler tools for us to use.
715.471
# RAJ
715.638
I didn't know you were coming again.
716.910
# HOWARD
716.910
Well, last week was a blast.
718.182
718.265
Plus, I thought you might
like having a guy here.
720.851
721.400
**LOL**
724.772
It was not funny.
726.315
726.700
**LOL**
# AMY
727.650
So, what tools did you bring?
728.859
# HOWARD
729.026
Everything we need
to make jewelry molds.
730.626
730.736
Here's some silver, a crucible
732.363
732.529
and an acetylene torch
to melt it down.
734.406
# PENNY
734.573
Ooh! That looks like fun.
736.408
# BERNADETTE
736.575
Maybe you should master glue
before you move on to fire.
739.662
739.600
**LOL**
# HOWARD
740.996
Okay, who's up first?
742.331
# AMY
742.498
Rajesh, want to make a bracelet
for your mom to go with the necklace?
745.668
# RAJ
745.834
No, thanks.
747.169
# HOWARD
747.336
I was gonna make
a necklace for my mom,
748.879
749.046
but unfortunately,
she doesn't have a neck.
751.006
751.700
**LOL**
753.008
She's just chins and fat and feet.
756.387
757.300

760.800
**LOL**
# LEONARD
760.683
Okay, we're almost ready to go.
762.309
762.476
Once we bond the wires,
we can test the tubes.
764.687
# ARTHUR
764.853
This is so exciting, I feel...
767.773
767.940
like I'm 75 again.
769.942
770.600
**LOL**
# LEONARD
774.697
Oh, God.
775.739
# ARTHUR
775.906
What... what is it?
777.116
# LEONARD
777.283
Sheldon just sent me a picture of him
and Bill Nye getting smoothies.
780.077
781.600
**LOL**
# ARTHUR
783.956
Can I ask you a question?
785.249
# LEONARD
785.249
Yeah, sure.
786.542
# ARTHUR
787.626
Why do you put up with Sheldon?
789.128
# LEONARD
790.045
Oh.
791.005
791.171
You know, because we're friends.
792.881
# ARTHUR
795.259
Why?
797.136
797.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
798.637
Wow, you ask really hard questions.
800.306
# ARTHUR
800.472
Yeah.
801.765
801.200
**LOL**
# LEONARD
801.932
Look, I know he can be aggravating,
804.143
804.310
but what you have to remember is that
he's not doing it on purpose.
807.104
807.271
It's just how he is.
808.522
808.689
But he's also loyal and trustworthy
811.650
811.817
and we have fun together.
813.235
# ARTHUR
813.402
You know you're describing a dog.
816.655
817.000
**LOL**
# LEONARD
818.699
He did bite me once.
819.908
820.900
**LOL**
822.077
But in his defense, I came up
behind him while he was eating.
825.080
825.500
**LOL**
# ARTHUR
826.165
Yeah, they hate that.
827.875
828.700
**LOL**
# LEONARD
830.085
You know what, Sheldon is the
smartest person I have ever met.
834.340
834.506
He's a little broken
and he needs me.
836.800
838.427
I guess I need him, too.
840.095
# ARTHUR
840.763
Why is that?
841.764
# LEONARD
842.514
Boy, you will not
let this go, will you?
844.391
844.800
**LOL**
847.269
Oh, geez.
848.520
# ARTHUR
848.687
Another photo from Sheldon?
850.272
# LEONARD
850.439
No, I have to go pick him up.
851.774
851.940
Bill Nye ditched him
at the smoothie place.
854.151
854.800
**LOL**
# ARTHUR
856.028
He probably stole his wallet, too.
858.197

# HOWARD
863.285
You know, if you guys are interested,
864.453
864.536
there's a technique
where I can take a lock of your hair,
866.776
866.872
refine it into carbon dust,
and use the hydraulic press at work
870.084
870.250
to turn it into a tiny little diamond
with your DNA in it.
873.337
# PENNY
873.504
Oh, that's amazing!
875.005
# HOWARD
875.172
Yeah. See Bernie's engagement ring?
876.572
876.673
That came right off my mom's back.
879.134
879.200
**LOL**
# BERNADETTE
880.803
He's kidding.
881.970
882.137
If that were true,
it'd be so much bigger.

**LOL**
# RAJ
886.850
"My name is Howard.
I can make your hair into diamonds.

My mom is morbidly obese.
Everybody love me."

**LOL**
# HOWARD
893.941
Whoa, where is that coming from?
895.609
# RAJ
895.776
I'll tell you where it's coming from.
897.778
897.945
All you do is make fun of me
for coming to girls' night,
899.739
899.822
and now you're here ruining it
for everyone.
901.532
# PENNY
901.615
Raj, cool it.
He's gonna make us hair diamonds.
905.285
904.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
906.203
How am I ruining anything?
907.496
907.663
I'm just trying to help you
make better jewelry.
909.543
# RAJ
909.665
But this isn't about the jewelry.
911.417
911.583
This is about me having a place where
I can open up about my feelings.
915.045
# HOWARD
915.671
Since when can't you open up
with me?
918.465
# RAJ
918.632
There are just some things
919.967
920.134
that I feel more comfortable
sharing with the girls,
921.886
921.969
because they won't make fun of me
923.679
923.846
or and call me names, or ask me if my
"Koothrapanties are in a bunch."
927.808
927.900
**LOL**
# HOWARD
931.520
Buddy, I was just joking around.
934.106
# RAJ
934.273
Yeah, well,
sometimes your jokes hurt.
935.983
# HOWARD
937.359
You're right.
938.485
938.652
I didn't realize
I was making you feel that way.
941.363
943.365
It was very brave of you to tell me.
945.576
# RAJ
945.742
Thank you.
947.035

It wasn't easy.

I'm surprised to see you here.

Yeah, me, too.
964.887

Somewhere around the third floor,
967.097
967.264
I began to see a white light.

If you're hoping to get in touch
with Bill Nye, I can't help you.

I've been informed that he's now
Bill Nye the Restraining Order Guy.

No, I'm... I was thinking,
if it isn't too much trouble,
991.455

I'd like to get your opinion
about my paper.

I hacked into your e-mail

**LOL**
# ARTHUR
1005.886
And... what did you think?
1007.888
# SHELDON
1008.055
Well, first, I think the fact
1010.307
1010.474
that you use your birthday
as a password is embarrassing.
1015.020

about how I acted the other night
1048.595
1048.762
so I made you a little something.

You didn't have to do that.
1052.307
# RAJ
1052.307

1053.559
1053.725
I used some of the jewelry techniques
you taught us.

It's a lightsaber belt buckle.

we can build that rocket,
