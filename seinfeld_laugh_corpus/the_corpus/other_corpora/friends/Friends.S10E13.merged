When she gets here, is it okay
if I introduce you two as my wife...
116.949

carrying my child, ha, ha?

# MONICA
146.458
We wanna get to know her better.
147.980
148.148
And, uh, she's never been to New York,
so she wants to see the tourist
151.733
151.901
Statue of Liberty,
Empire State Building.

# CHANDLER
154.028
Oh, there's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.

And, you know, there's always
some idiot who goes, "Moo."

No, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?
175.174
175.341
Uh, a mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?
178.844

# ROSS
194.277
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Long Island with you.
196.361

# ROSS
342.091
Rach, I think I'm gonna
wait out here...
344.301
344.469
...because, uh, my throat is feeling a
little scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.

That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?

Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on
the phone if you'd like to speak to him.

Oh, great.
Um, are you gonna be okay?

What, the heart attack
or sitting here talking to you?

I was gonna make us some dinner...
515.805
515.973
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.

I think we solved the mystery
of the heart attack.

It's just so weird seeing him like that,
you know? I mean, he's a doctor.

What?

# ROSS
580.079
They gave him a lot of medication.
581.746
581.914
He wouldn't even know
if you were there.

584.000
We'll go see him first thing
in the morning.

Can we ask you some
questions about the father?
744.159
# ERICA
744.326
Oh, sure. Yeah.
746.077
746.245
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.
750.999
751.876
Got a scholarship and went to college.
753.481
# CHANDLER

How's that, now?
762.844
# ERICA
763.387
Well, there's a chance
it's another guy.
766.222
766.390
I mean, I've only ever been
with two guys...
769.976
770.144
...but they sort of overlapped.
772.395
772.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
773.147
So, what does the other guy do?
774.647
774.815
Does he go to college too?

No, he's in prison.

Well, um,
was he falsely accused of something?
784.032

784.950
No.
786.326
786.494
He killed his father with a shovel.
788.787
789.200
**LOL**
790.956
Other than that, he's a great guy.
792.665

I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

Are you awake?

# CHANDLER
815.648
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.
818.817
818.500
**LOL**
# MONICA
822.905
Well, all right, let's say that it is him.
824.948
825.115
Would we not want the baby? No.
826.783
826.951
Would we treat him any differently?
828.660
# CHANDLER
828.660
I'd keep an eye on him.
830.370
831.400
**LOL**

We have to find out
which the father is.
835.041

How?

# CHANDLER
836.105
I don't know.

They have tests for these things, right?
839.233
# MONICA
839.233
Yeah, but maybe we're overreacting.
841.297
# CHANDLER
841.465
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.
844.801
844.700
**LOL**
845.511
He probably loves his mommy.
847.262
847.429
He's probably got a tattoo that says
"Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.
