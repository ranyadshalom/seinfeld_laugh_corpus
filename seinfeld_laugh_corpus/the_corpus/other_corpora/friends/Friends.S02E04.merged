That was 10 blocks from here,
and the woman was walking alone at night.
9.174
9.384
I would never do that.
11.010

Mom, come on, stop worrying.

I'm not "married" married,

He was just a friend, and he's gay...

I can't believe you married Duncan.
149.064

150.859
We lived together,
we told each other everything.
152.985
# PHOEBE
153.194
I'm sorry, Monica, but I knew if I told you,
you'd get really, like, judgmental...

...and would not approve.
158.031
# MONICA
158.241
Of course I wouldn't approve.

But at the last minute
I couldn't go through with it.
276.984
277.402
So they let me be the guy who comes in
to fix the copier but can't...
280.320
280.530
...because there's people
having sex on it.

Why, yes, Ross, pressing my third nipple
opens the delivery entrance...
306.388

...to the magical land of Narnia.

**LOL**
# JULIE

You know, in some cultures, having
a third nipple is actually a sign of virility.

You get the best huts,
and women dance naked around you.

For your information, I'm going to see him
so I can put all those feelings behind me.
382.589
383.132
And the reason I'm dressed like this
is because I think it's nice...

Is it because she's so cold in bed?

makes it feel like school?

No. No. She's great. And it's not

706.997
So I thought about what you said
and about what he said.
709.916
710.126
And, well, his way,
I get to have sex tonight, so...
712.627
714.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
719.301
What is this in my pocket?
721.678
722.346
Why, it's Joey's porno movie.
724.556
725.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
727.226
Pop it in.
728.309
# JOEY
729.228
I'm fine with it, I mean,
if you're okay watching a video...
731.604
731.772
...filled with two-nippled people.
734.065
734.400
**LOL**
# RACHEL
737.486
Great. People having sex.
That's just what I need to see.
740.280
# ROSS
740.698
What's wrong with people having sex?
742.741
# RACHEL
743.075
Well...
744.743
745.578
Well, um, you know,
these movies are offensive...
750.123
750.332
...and, uh, degrading
to women and females...
754.794
755.500
**LOL**
755.463
And, uh, the lighting's
always unflattering.
759.090
760.200
**LOL**
761.135
And...
762.510
762.678
Monica, help me out here.
764.346
# MONICA
764.346
Hell, I wanna see Joey.

# JULIE
772.938
So is there, like, a story,
or do they just start doing it right...
775.607
777.193
Oh. Never mind.
779.068

793.958
794.168
See, I'm coming to fix the copier.
795.960
796.212
I can't get to the copier. I'm thinking,
"What do I do? What do I do?"
799.964
799.900
**LOL**
801.717
So I just watch them have sex.
804.093
805.100
**LOL**
807.556
And then I say... Here's my line.
809.057
809.433
You know, that's bad for the paper tray.

Wait, you see me again.
Hang on, the guy's butt's blocking me.
819.943

There I am. There I am. There I am.

So, um... So, what's up?
You came to see me yesterday.
835.250
# DUNCAN
835.543
Oh, yeah, um...
837.293
838.671
All right.
839.838
841.215
I kind of need a divorce.
843.383
843.843
Okay.
846.678
846.700
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
847.137
How come?
848.179
# DUNCAN
848.764
Um, actually, I'm getting married again.
852.183
# PHOEBE
852.393
What?
853.601
# DUNCAN
853.853
Oh, God,
I don't know how to tell you this.
855.812
# PHOEBE
858.023
I'm straight.
859.357
859.800
**LOL**
# DUNCAN
861.235
Yeah, I know.
862.652
# PHOEBE
863.863
I don't understand. I don't understand.
How can you be straight?
867.156
867.366
I mean, you're so smart and funny...
869.826
870.035
...and you throw
such great Academy Award parties.
872.912
873.500
**LOL**
# DUNCAN
873.122
I know. That's what I kept telling myself.
875.498
875.708
But you just reach a point
where you can't live a lie anymore.
878.543
878.400
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
880.546
So how long have you known?
882.755
883.300
**LOL**
# DUNCAN
884.425
I guess on some level
I always knew I was straight.
887.886
888.200
**LOL**
888.846
I thought I was supposed
to be something else.
890.930
891.140
You know, I'm an ice dancer, all my
friends are gay. I was just trying to fit in.
895.894
895.700
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
897.688
And, um... And there's actually a woman?
901.858
# DUNCAN
903.027
Her name's Debra.
904.256
# PHOEBE
904.256
Oh.
905.486
905.700
**LOL**
907.531
Well, is she the first
that you've been with?
910.450
# DUNCAN
912.244
Well, I've never told you this...
913.870
914.038
...but there were one or two times
back in college...
919.584
919.752
...when I'd get really drunk
and go to a straight bar...
921.920
922.129
...and wake up with a woman next to me.
924.380
924.300
**LOL**
924.548
But I told myself it was the liquor,
and everyone experiments in college.
929.761
930.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
931.305
Sure.
932.347
# DUNCAN
932.556
But now I know I don't have a choice
about this. I was born this way.
935.767
936.500
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
939.647
I don't know what to say.
941.230
941.398
I mean, you know,
you're married to someone for six years...
944.400
944.568
...and you think you know him.
946.069
946.236
And then one day he says,
"Oh, I'm not gay."
949.280
949.500
**LOL**
# DUNCAN
954.662
I'm... I'm still me.
956.871
958.300
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
958.916
Why couldn't you just have
figured this out six years ago?
962.418
963.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
965.005
You know,
it still smells like monkey in there.

Well, this has been great,
but I'm officially wiped.

**LOL**
983.565
Come on, look, it's only 11:30.
985.775
986.026
Let's just talk. We never just
hang out and talk anymore.

# RACHEL
1000.541
Well, you have been in our lives
for nearly two months now...
1004.377
1005.004
...and we don't really know you.
1006.879
1007.089
I mean, who is Julie?
1008.673
1009.300
**LOL**
1010.134
I mean, what do you like?
What don't you like?
1012.301

We want to know everything.

So?
1018.725

the time to get to know Julie?

I got the time to get to know Julie.

Can I go?

Okay, Julie, so let's start with
your childhood. What was that like?
1038.745
1038.700
**LOL**
# JULIE
1040.080
Well, in a nutshell...
1041.623

Ah-ah-ah.
1043.166
1043.800
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
1045.711
So, um, have you told your parents?
1048.337
# DUNCAN
1048.839
No, but it'll be okay. They're pretty cool.
1051.841
1052.051
My brother's straight, so...
1054.385
1054.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
1055.888
Here you go.
1057.305
1057.556
You know what?
I just have one more question. Um...
1060.058
1060.517
If you had figured this out sooner,
and, um, I had been around...
1065.438
1065.731
...do you think I would have been
the one who?
1068.441
1069.443
No, no. That's all right. Don't tell me.
1071.486
1071.737
I don't think either answer
would make me feel better. Here.
1075.698
# DUNCAN
1077.701
I love you, Phoebe.
1078.868

And my second-grade teacher
was Miss Thomas...
1106.104

1106.355
...and my first-grade teacher
was Mrs. Cobb.

Are you just gonna pounce?

It is your first time with her, and, you know,
if the first time doesn't go well...

...well then, that's pretty darn
hard to recover from.

Right.
1225.598
1227.684
Maybe it doesn't have to be this tough.
1230.394
1230.979
Maybe you were on the right track with
that whole, you know, spontaneous thing.

want you to...
1245.534
1245.702
What?
1246.702
1246.702
I don't know, catch me off guard.
1247.703
1247.871
You know, with, like, a really...
1249.997
1250.707
...good kiss.
1252.041
1252.876
You know, really...
1254.543
1254.711
...sort of, um, soft at first.
1258.756
1259.883
And then maybe, um,
brush the hair away from my face.
1264.804
1265.305
And then look far into my eyes...
1269.392
1269.643
...in a way that lets me
know something...
1272.311

1284.365
1284.574
...you'd pull me
really close to you so that...
1287.493
1287.744
So that I'd be pressed up, you know,
right against you.
1291.289
1291.581
And, um, it would get kind of...
1295.876
1297.629
...sweaty...
1299.213
1300.882
...and, uh... And blurry.
