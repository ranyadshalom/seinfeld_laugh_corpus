What?

Are you kidding? Okay,
I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint.

Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.

Chandler's eyes!
24.523

**LOL**
# CHANDLER

I got glasses.
27.443

27.652
You always had glasses.
30.070

Are you sure?

**LOL**
# RACHEL
38.788
Didn't you used to have a pair?
40.330
40.498
They were really round and burgundy,
and they made you look kind of, um....
44.668
# JOEY
44.836
Feminine.
45.858
# RACHEL
45.858
Yes!
46.879

I think the glasses look great.
They make you look sexy.

Really?
52.260
# MONICA
52.260
Yeah.
53.010
# CHANDLER
53.178
You didn't think
I used to wear glasses, right?
55.387
# MONICA
55.555
Of course.
56.076
56.076
Pfft.
56.597

I had no idea.

# PHOEBE
113.863
What do you want for
an engagement present?
115.948
# CHANDLER
116.116
Oh, that's okay, we're not having a party...
118.242
118.409
...so you don't have to get us--
119.806
119.806
Ah, buh-buh-buh! Heh.
121.203
# MONICA
121.371
If someone wants to give us a present,
we don't want to deprive them of that joy.
125.457
125.400
**LOL**
# RACHEL
126.459
Oh, you should get them
one of those little CD players.
128.961
# MONICA
129.170
Oh, I already have one.
130.504
# PHOEBE
130.672
Unless someone borrowed it
and left it at the gynecologist.
133.882
134.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
137.095
Yeah, and by "someone"
she means Joey.

143.350
# CHANDLER

What we want, honey.
144.915
# MONICA
144.915
No, you don't want this.
146.311
146.700
**LOL**
147.313
I want to have your grandmother's
cookie recipe.
149.982
# PHOEBE
150.191
You mean the chocolate chip
cookie recipe?
152.609
# MONICA
152.777
Uh-huh, yeah.
153.694
# PHOEBE
153.694
The one my grandmother...
154.611
154.779
...made me swear on her deathbed...
156.446
156.614
...that I would never
let out of our family?
159.074
159.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
159.826
Dying people say the craziest things.
162.870
162.800

# MONICA
164.414
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my children.
167.833
# PHOEBE
168.918
Break my heart. Oh, all right.
171.503
171.600
**LOL**
# MONICA
171.713
I'll be the mom who makes the
world's best chocolate chip cookies.
175.215
# CHANDLER
175.466
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?
178.719

Ahoy!
181.493

181.493
Hey.
182.264
182.473
How's the boat?
183.829
# JOEY
183.829
I'm getting into this sailing stuff.
185.184
# MONICA
185.351
You finally took it out of the marina?
187.186
# JOEY
187.812
Why would I do that?
189.271
189.400
**LOL**
189.981
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.
192.858
# PHOEBE
193.651
If you don't sail it,
what do you do on it?
195.777
# JOEY
195.987
It's a great place
to just kind of sit...
197.863
198.031
...hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.
201.491
202.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
203.036
It's good that you finally
have a place to do that.
206.288

**LOL**
# RACHEL
207.081
Joey, I could teach you
to sail if you want.
209.374
# JOEY
209.584
You could?
210.793
# RACHEL
210.793
Yeah, I've been sailing my whole life.
212.002
212.170
When I was 1 5,
my dad bought me my own boat.
215.214
215.600
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
216.674
Your own boat?
217.737
# RACHEL
217.737
He was trying to cheer me up.
218.800
219.010
My pony was sick.
220.886
221.200

# CHANDLER
232.232
You know what I was thinking?
233.315
# MONICA
233.315
What?
234.399
# CHANDLER
234.859
Nothing, I just like to go like this.
236.944
237.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
238.154
Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
239.738
# CHANDLER
239.738
Why, do you have a lecture?
241.323
# ROSS
241.491
No, why?
243.138
# CHANDLER
243.138
Then, free as a bird. What's up?
244.785
244.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
244.953
Uh, my dad wants to know if you want
to play racquetball.
247.746
# MONICA
247.914
Wow, that's great! Dad must like you.
249.623
249.791
He doesn't ask just anyone to play.
251.334
# ROSS
251.334
He didn't really ask for you.
252.876
253.044
He asked for "Chauncey."
I assumed he meant you.
256.546
256.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
257.173
Did you correct him?
258.632
# ROSS
258.800
No, I thought it would be
more fun this way.
261.426
261.500
**LOL**
# MONICA
262.887
Maybe this is something
you could do this every week.
265.347
# ROSS
265.515
Or you could sit on the porch...
267.015
267.183
...and make sure no one
steals the trashcans.
269.643
269.811
He does that every week too.
271.937
272.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
273.273
Just so you know, you have to let
him win. He hates to lose.
276.566
# ROSS
# MONICA
# CHANDLER
276.734
Oh, no problem.
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.
279.736
# ROSS
280.905
You're not a lefty?
282.197
# CHANDLER
283.658
Does anybody know me?
285.367
285.600
**LOL**
# MONICA
290.456
What's wrong, Phoebe?
291.498
# PHOEBE
291.666
I just went to my old apartment
to get you the cookie recipe...
295.085
295.253
...and that stupid fire burned it up!
297.796
# MONICA
297.964
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof box...
301.883
302.051
...and keep it at least 1 00 yards
away from the original?
305.012
308.600
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
310.643
Because I'm normal.
313.312
313.900
**LOL**
315.148
That was the one legacy
my grandmother left me.
317.691
317.942
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.
320.777
# ROSS
320.945
We have to get you
an engagement present?
323.113
323.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
324.073
Don't worry about it.
325.324
# ROSS
325.533
No one got me an engagement present.
328.076
327.900
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
328.453
Okay, here.
I don't have the recipe, but here.
332.247
332.498
I wish you health
and happiness.
334.916
# CHANDLER
335.877
An old cookie?
337.961
337.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
338.254
See, this is what happens
when you don't register for gifts.
341.590
341.400
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
342.717
I made a batch and I froze it.
And this is the only one left.
347.429
# CHANDLER
347.597
We can't accept this.
348.847
# PHOEBE
348.847
Why not?
350.098
# CHANDLER
351.059
Because it's gross.
353.101
353.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
353.811
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.
357.064
357.273
I do this at work all the time.
358.732
# PHOEBE
358.900
Really?
359.671
# MONICA
359.671
Yeah, I think I can.
360.442
360.610
Oh, yay!
361.985
364.000
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
365.406
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.
367.282
# ROSS
367.450
Two! I've been engaged twice.

**LOL**
# JOEY
379.045
Look at this clown.
380.295
380.463
Because he's got a bigger boat
he thinks he can take up the whole river.
383.799
383.966
Get out of the way, jackass!
386.676
386.800
**LOL**
388.429
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?
391.056
391.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
393.810
That is the Coast Guard.
395.311
# JOEY
395.311
What are they doing out here?
396.812
396.979
The coast is all the way over there.
399.231
399.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
400.108
Joey, just ignore the boats.
401.608
401.776
We're not finished with our lesson.
402.923
# JOEY
402.923
All right.
404.069
404.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
404.237
I'm gonna go over the basic
points one more time.
406.488
# JOEY
406.656
Come on, Rach. Not again. I got it, okay?
Let's start sailing!
409.825
409.992
I want to go over there
where that boatload of girls is. Yeah, oh!
413.620
414.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
414.872
Oh, is that what you wanna do?
416.248
416.416
You want to give a shout out
to the old hot chicas?
419.167
419.400
**LOL**
419.335
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.
421.670
421.838
Quick question,
423.422
423.422
What's this called?
425.006
# JOEY
425.550
Uh, boat rope?
427.510
428.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
427.510
Wrong.
429.469
429.637
How do you get the mainsail up?
430.992
430.992
Uh....
432.347
# JOEY
432.932
Rub it?
434.599
435.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
437.645
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?
441.148
# JOEY
441.315
I'd say, "Come again?" Ha, ha.
443.733
443.800
**LOL**
443.901
No, no, I know this one.
I know this one. Uh, um....
446.445
448.900
**LOL**
# RACHEL
448.739
Time's up. Now you're dead.
450.532
# JOEY
450.700
And deaf!
451.825
451.900
**LOL**
# RACHEL
451.993
Okay, you go on
and make your little jokes.
454.161
454.328
If you don't know
what you're doing at sea...
456.371
456.539
...you will die at sea.
Am I getting through to you, sailor?
459.958
459.600
**LOL**
# JOEY
460.460
Yes.
461.461
# RACHEL
461.461
Don't just say yes.
462.461
462.628
This isn't a game.
You could get hurt out here!
465.172
464.900
**LOL**
465.339
So do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?
468.133
469.500
**LOL**
# JOEY
471.512
I want to make a
ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

# MONICA
486.694
You don't? Heh.
Well, that's the difference...
489.529
489.697
...between a professional and a layman.
491.531
492.300
**LOL**
# PHOEBE

That and arrogance.

# MONICA
498.372
Hey. How was sailing?
499.915
# JOEY
500.625
I don't want to talk about it.
502.626
502.900

# PHOEBE
516.349
I can't believe that.
517.557
517.725
Now the only thing left
of my grandmother's legacy is...
521.061
521.229
...this crumb.
522.896

I wish you a long and happy marriage.

532.782
Well, I had a great time.
534.449
534.617
Um, Chauncey on the other hand....
537.953
537.900
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
538.162
I will tell the story.
540.163
540.414
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding...
543.500
543.751
...he even said I could call him Dad.
545.585
# ROSS
545.753
And what did he ask you
not to call him?
547.587
# CHANDLER
548.548
"Daddy."
550.006
550.200
**LOL**
551.175
Look, here's the story.
553.134
554.011
We had just finished playing racquetball...
556.429
556.597
...and we were gonna take a steam.
558.223
558.391
I walk into the steam room...
559.975
560.142
...and it's really steamy.
562.060
561.900
**LOL**
564.647
So I take off my glasses,
and that's when it happened.
567.816

592.550
You gave my father a lap dance.
594.968
595.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
598.431
Why do they put
so much steam in there?
600.974
600.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
602.518
Because otherwise they'd
have to call it the "room" room.
607.272
607.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
608.774
Why, okay? Why?
Why did that have to happen?

# PHOEBE
613.654
Come on, it's not that big a deal.
615.280
# CHANDLER
615.489
Not that big a deal? There
617.866
618.117
There was touching of things.
620.493

**LOL**
# ROSS
620.703
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad...
622.871

to that part?

**LOL**
# MONICA
629.545
Listen, I'm sure Dad doesn't care.
He probably thought this was funny.
633.089
633.257
He'll be telling this story for years.
635.050
# CHANDLER
635.217
I don't want him to tell
this story for years.

637.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
638.304
Oh, but he will.
640.597
641.432
He still tells the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.
645.518
645.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
647.355
I wasn't escaping.
648.480

Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?
650.940

If that is your father calling
to tell this story...
661.993

Come on. Hello.

I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

Okay, I'll call you later, Dad. I love you.

Aren't you a little overdressed?

**LOL**
# RACHEL

Yeah, and you better make sure
he tips you this time.
687.727

**LOL**
# CHANDLER
688.813
I figured I would try to convince
him not to tell the story anymore...
692.107
692.358
...and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.
695.235
695.486
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.
697.987
698.239
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.

back out on the water, matey?

Oh, uh, I don't know the boat way

Why not?
727.413

Because you're mean on the boat.

I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.
741.573

She wouldn't let me help out at all.

# RACHEL
743.784
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.
But you couldn't move your arms...
747.162

...because you were wearing
three life jackets.
750.373

Look, Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.
758.798
758.966
But I tell you something,
that was not mean.
761.134
761.302
My father is mean. He used to yell at me
all the time on the boat.
765.096
765.347
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.
768.433
# JOEY

Does a good teacher say,
"Put down the beer, pinhead!"
771.519
772.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
772.271
Does a good student drink 7 beers
during his first lesson?

776.317
Six and a half.
777.525
777.700

I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.
782.155
# JOEY
782.364
Well, it hit me anyway.
783.698

It would have hurt a lot less
if I had finished that last beer.
787.118

I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
and, uh, stop yelling.

I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to sail a boat.

As a matter of fact, when I started
