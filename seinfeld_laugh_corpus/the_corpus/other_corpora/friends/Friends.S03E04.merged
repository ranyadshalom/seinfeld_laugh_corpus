flinging, flanging hard to open.

there's a new product that guarantees...
37.369
37.537
...you'll never have to open up
milk cartons again?
40.497

Meet the Milkmaster 2000.

AUDIENCE :
Ooh.

**LOL**
# MIKE
49.549
This is his first time. He's never used this.
You're gonna see how easy this is to do.
54.053
54.929
This works in any milk carton.
56.472
# JOEY
56.472
Wow, it is easy. Ha, ha.

Now I can have milk every day.

Perhaps you would like me to turn like this

# CHANDLER
131.047
Hey, man. What's up?
132.486
# JOEY
132.486
Maybe you can tell me.
133.924
134.175
My agent would like to know
why I didn't show up at my audition today...
137.886
138.054
...the first good thing she gets me in weeks.
How could you not give me the message?
141.932
# CHANDLER
142.100
I'll tell you, I do enjoy guilt...
144.518
144.600
**LOL**
145.061
...but it wasn't me.
146.812
# PHOEBE
146.980
Yes, it was. lt was him. Uh-huh.
148.939
149.400
**LOL**
150.900
Okay, it was me.
152.234
# JOEY
154.404
How was it you?
156.072
# PHOEBE
156.072
Well, it was all so crazy, you know?
157.739
157.991
Chandler was in the closet
counting to 1 0 and was up to seven...
160.993
161.161
...and I hadn't found a place to hide yet.
163.162
163.700
**LOL**
164.497
Look, I meant to tell you, and I wrote it all
down on my hand. See? All of it.
168.959
# JOEY
169.419
JOEY: Yep, that's my audition.
170.336
# MONICA
170.336
Yeah.
171.253
171.900
**LOL**
171.546
See? Now, this is why I keep
notepads everywhere.
174.423
# PHOEBE
174.591
Yep. And that's why we don't
invite you to play.
177.509
177.600
**LOL**
# JANICE
178.595
What is the great tragedy here?
Get yourself another appointment.
182.097
# JOEY
182.348
Well, Estelle tried. The casting director
told her I missed my chance.
186.393
# PHOEBE
186.561
Well, that is unfair.
187.811
187.979
I'll call her.
I'll tell her it was totally my fault.
190.647
# JOEY
190.857
You can't.
The casting director doesn't talk to friends.
193.775
193.985
She only talks to agents.
195.632
# PHOEBE
195.632
What a sad little life she must lead.
197.279
197.600
**LOL**
198.781
Okay. Ooh.
200.782
# JOEY
200.950
What are you doing? What are you doing?

205.079
Hi, this is Caitlin
from Phoebe Buffay's office.
208.332
208.600
**LOL**
208.499
Um, is, um, Anne there for Phoebe?
212.252
212.420
She'll know what it's about.
214.755
214.600
**LOL**
# JOEY
214.923
Hang up. Hang up right
216.882

**LOL**
# PHOEBE
218.384
Annie? Hi. Listen,
we've got a problem with Joey Tribbiani.
221.970
222.222
Apparently, he missed his audition.
Who did you speak to in my office?
225.682
225.975
Estelle? I don't know
what I'm gonna do with her.
228.268
228.436
So your husband leaves and burns down
the apartment. The world does not stop.
232.648
233.000
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
233.816
Is anybody else scared?
235.400
# PHOEBE
236.986
If Joey loses this audition,
then that is it for Estelle. I don't care.
240.906
241.908
Annie, you are a doll.
What time can you see him?
244.576
244.744
I need a pen. Pen.

Where's my boy?
266.223
266.391
Here's my boy.
268.517

What's, uh--?
What's my boy doing with a Barbie?
279.778
280.800
**LOL**
# CAROL
280.863
He picked it out at the toy store himself.
He loves it.
283.532
# SUSAN
283.700
He carries it everywhere,
like a security blanket.
286.368
286.536
But with ski boots and a kicky beret.
289.579
289.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
290.498
Yeah, it's cute.
292.207
292.375
Why does he have it again?
295.377
295.100
**LOL**
# SUSAN
295.586
So he's got a doll. So what?
298.547
299.382
Unless you're afraid
he's gonna grow up to be...
302.926
303.094
...in show business.
304.720
305.500
**LOL**
# CAROL
305.388
This wouldn't have to do with the fact
that he's being raised by two women?
309.057
# ROSS
311.102
You know what? It's fine. If you're
okay with the Barbie thing, so am I.
316.064
# ROSS
316.232
Give Daddy the Barbie.
Give me the Barbie. Okay, how about--?
319.526
318.000

Don't you wanna play
with a monster truck?
322.070

324.157
No? Okay.
325.407

# RACHEL
334.083
You are so pathetic.

I'm gonna have to see her tonight.
377.626

Last night at dinner,
when the meals came...
387.552
387.720
...she put half her chicken piccata
on my plate and took all my tomatoes.
392.474
392.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
394.394
And that's bad...
396.520
396.687
...because you hate chicken piccata?
398.980
399.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
399.649
No.
400.816
# ROSS
400.983
You didn't wanna share your tomatoes.
Tomatoes are very important to you.
405.362
404.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
405.530
All of a sudden, we were this couple.
407.489
407.698
And this alarm started going off
in my head.
410.325
410.493
"Run for your life!
Get out of the building!"

Ugh. Men are unbelievable.
415.914
# MONICA

What is it with you people?
417.707
418.000
The minute you feel something,
you have to run away?

# CHANDLER
421.421
I know. That
423.338
424.200
**LOL**
424.674
That's why I don't wanna go tonight.
I'm afraid I'm gonna say something stupid.
429.136
# MONICA
429.345
Oh. You mean that guy thing
where you act mean and distant...
432.180
432.348
...until you get us to break up with you?
433.453
433.453
Mm-hm.
434.558
# JOEY
434.725
Hey, you know about that?
435.934
437.300
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
437.854
What do I do? I wanna get past this.
439.521
439.689
I don't wanna be afraid
of the commitment thing.
442.023
442.191
I wanna go through the tunnel
to the other side.
445.694
445.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
446.696
Where there's no fear of commitment.
448.322
448.322
Ah.
449.948
449.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
450.116
Do we have any--?
452.075
456.372
Do we have any thoughts here?
457.914
# JOEY
458.458
I've never been through
the tunnel myself because...
460.500
460.668
...you're not allowed through
with more than one girl in the car.
463.336
463.504
Hmm.
464.629
464.300
**LOL**
466.883
But it seems to me it's pretty much
like anything else. Face your fear.
471.178
471.387
You have a fear of heights?
Go to the top of the building.
474.389
474.557
You're afraid of bugs.
476.558
477.185
Get a bug.
478.435
479.000
**LOL**
479.645
Right?
481.062
481.230
You have a fear of commitment.
482.981
483.232
So I say you go in there and you be
the most committed guy there ever was.
487.694
# RACHEL
487.862
Amazingly, that makes sense.
490.113
# CHANDLER
490.990
Do you think?
492.533
# JOEY
492.533
Oh, yeah. Go for it, man.
494.075
494.243
Jump off the high dive.
495.410
495.578
Stare down the barrel of the gun.
Pee into the wind.

# CHANDLER
501.000
Joe, if I'm staring down
the barrel of a gun...

You got it.
545.168
545.168
Oh! You got it.
546.336
546.796
Um, will he work for scale, you ask me?

Well, I don't know about that.

642.098
# CHANDLER
642.600
Yes, I did.
643.767
643.934
Yes, I did. Because you're my girlfriend...

Yup. We're a couple,
and that's what couples do.
681.096
681.764
And I wanna meet your parents.

We should take a trip with your parents.

Ha, ha. I actually am. This is amazing.
701.324
701.534
My entire life, I have feared this place.
704.786
705.037
And now that I'm here, it's like,
what was the big deal?
707.747
707.915
I could probably say,
"Let's move in together," and I'd be okay.
711.793
# JANICE
712.294
You probably want us
to move in together?
714.629

It doesn't scare me.

717.528
Yeah, well it scares me.

I'm not even divorced yet.
You just invited me over here for pasta...
723.138
723.305
...and all of a sudden
you're talking about moving in together.
726.307
726.475
And I wasn't even that hungry.
728.560
729.100

You know what? It's getting really late,
and I should just, um

# CHANDLER
732.857
Don't go. I've scared you.
I've said too much.

I'm hopeless and awkward
and desperate for love.

Hey, Janice, it's me.
747.996

820.903
...you go shopping,
you get your butt in a bubble bath.
823.404

If you want her back,
you have got to start acting aloof.

She has to know you're not needy.
829.410
# RACHEL

So, what you have to do is...
831.371
831.539
...you have to accidentally run into her
on purpose...
834.499
834.667
