699.239
Yeah.
699.781
700.900
**LOL**
701.450
But you don't talk about
your girlfriend...
704.536
704.704
...and the intimate stuff
you do with her.
707.914
# RACHEL
708.666
Not even with your best friend?
709.729

710.960
That is so sad.

713.400
**LOL**
713.671
You're missing out on so much.
716.131
716.424
I mean, the bonding and the sharing...
719.050
719.301
...and knowing they're going through
the same thing you are.
722.971
# ROSS
723.139
Oh. So, what, you tell each
other everything?
727.642
# RACHEL

Pretty much.

Okay, now close your eyes...
762.844

# MONICA
768.225
Richard's living room, drinking wine.

# PHOEBE
770.853
No, no, no. Not a Richard thing.
Just put down the glass and get out.
776.065

I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.

796.295
There are no questions
in the happy place.

There's just, you know,
the lovely waterfalls...
817.899

...and the trickling fountains...
820.610
820.778
...and the calming sounds
of the babbling brook.

I, uh, never said hate.
I was very careful about that.

# JANICE
840.589
A little birdie told me you wanting to
rip your arm off and throw it at me.
845.844
# JOEY
847.304
And you got "hate" from that?
You're taking a big leap there, I, uh....
851.558
849.600
**LOL**
# JANICE
851.725
All right, fine, fine, fine!
853.601
853.769
We have got to do something about
our little situation here.
857.605
857.773
So this is my idea.
859.399
859.567
You and me spending
some quality time together.

# JOEY
877.626
Does it have to be a day?
879.002
# JANICE
879.169
Yes, because that's how long
it takes to love me.
883.631
883.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
884.174
Yeah, I know. Ha.
I sleep in the next room.
888.303

**LOL**
# MONICA
892.558
I went down to the post office...
894.559
894.727
...and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered...
897.645
897.813
...for Richard about the Civil War.
900.815
900.983
He loved the Civil War.

Girth?
940.730

# ROSS
946.487
Rachel says sharing's great
and supposedly...
949.906
950.074
...we ought to be doing it.
952.575
953.619
Uh, do you want to?
955.954
956.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
957.581
We're not gonna talk about girth?

969.884
970.052
...Rachel and I are in bed
talking about fantasies...
973.638
973.806
...and I happened to describe
a particular...
977.809
978.394
...Star wars thing
979.894
# CHANDLER
980.062
Princess Leia and the gold bikini.

984.524
985.693
Whoa. Wow.
987.694
987.903
Well, that was easy. Ha, ha.
988.654
988.654
Ha, ha.
989.404

Okay.
991.364
# ROSS
991.364
Okay.
991.906

Okay, you know when you're
in bed with a woman...
995.451
# ROSS
995.619
Uh.
996.703
997.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
996.912
...and, uh, ahem, you know,
you're fooling around...
1000.248
1000.416
...and you get all these
mental images in your brain?
1003.209
1003.419
Like Elle MacPherson
or the girl at the Xerox place?
1006.671
# ROSS
1006.839
With the bellybutton ring? Oh.
1008.194
# CHANDLER
1008.194
Oh! I know.
1009.549
1009.500
**LOL**
1009.717
And then all of a sudden,
your mom pops into your head.
1012.301
1014.054
And you're, like,
"Mom, get out of here!"
1017.724
1017.600
**LOL**
1017.975
But after that,
you can't think of anything else.
1020.601
1020.769
And you can't stop what you're doing.
So it's kind of like you're...
1026.065
1026.442
...you know, you know....
1028.860
1029.028
You don't know!

1065.189
And, uh, you know,
I love this woman. Ha-ha-ha.

I have to go pick up the baby.
So I'll see you later, sweetheart.

# CHANDLER
1100.557
I appreciate you giving it a shot.
1102.600
# JOEY
1102.768
But you know, the good thing...
1105.103
1105.270
...is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived.
1108.731
1108.899
And what's even more amazing,
so did she. Ha, ha.
1112.151
1112.319
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.
1114.278
1114.900

I guess that's something.
1117.657
# JOEY
1117.825
Oh, man, that's huge!
1119.659
1119.827
Now I know I can stand to be
around her. Which means...
1123.246
1123.413
...I get to hang out with you.
1125.123
1125.290
Which is kind of
the whole point anyway. Ha, ha.
1128.167
# CHANDLER
1128.794
Okay.

Maybe.

Honey, relationships are hard.
Like with your mom and me.

1259.091
You know, after we graduated from
college, we broke up for a while.
1262.927
1263.095
It seems her father,
your grandfather...
1265.638
1265.806
...wanted her to travel around Europe
like he did.
1268.432
1268.600
Of course, he got to do it
on Uncle Sam's nickel...
1271.352
1271.520
...because he was also strafing
German troop trains at the time.
