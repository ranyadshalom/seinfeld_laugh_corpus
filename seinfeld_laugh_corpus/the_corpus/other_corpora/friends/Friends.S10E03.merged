Well, it was good,
until we got back to our apartment.
806.012
806.180
And then we were fooling around and
he started to put his hand up my leg...
809.849
810.017
...and I kept slapping it away.
811.684
# CHANDLER
811.852
You didn't like that?
813.186
814.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
815.147
Well, it wasn't just me, all right?
He freaked out too.
817.982
818.150
He couldn't even undo my bra.
819.901
# MONICA
820.110
Wow, really? One time he just looked
at my bra and it popped open.
823.488
824.100
**LOL**
# RACHEL
826.867
I do not know what's wrong with us.
829.202
829.370
We've kissed before
and that's been great.
831.704
831.997
But this time
it was leading somewhere...
833.957
834.124
...and I was very aware of the fact
that it was Joey touching me.
837.627
# MONICA
837.795
You guys have been friends forever.
839.712
839.880
The first time you kissed Ross
was weird.
842.423
842.591
Mm-hm.
843.321
843.321
You couldn't stop laughing.
844.050
844.218
You got through that.
844.947
844.947
Mm-hm.
845.677
# RACHEL
845.845
Okay. That's true.
That's true, we can do this.
849.264
849.431
You're right. We can do this.
We'll just power through.

# JOEY
852.935
Hey, uh, Chandler, can I talk to you
for a second?

No need, problem solved.
We are powering through.

877.418
No.
878.543
# MONICA
878.752
I'm sorry for screwing up that "cutting
her out" plan, but I have a new plan.
882.672
882.840
Chandler will call in a few minutes
with an emergency.
885.967
# PHOEBE
886.135
Oh, okay, what kind of emergency
gets us both out of here?
889.262

What do you think of Mike and Chandler
being in a car accident?

Both of you, look at me.
Look how young I look.

910.900
**LOL**
912.369
Oh, gosh, we have
so much to catch up on.
915.038
915.247
But first things first. Touch my abs.
I don't exercise at all.
920.543

920.711
Oh, gosh. So, Monica, you're married.
923.546

# AMANDA
925.861
Oh, smell my neck.
928.009
927.700

It's not perfume. It's me.
It's my natural scent.

945.318
# MONICA
945.903
When were we not friends?
947.321
# AMANDA
947.321
Well, it was 1 992.
948.738
948.906
And I remember, because that was the
year I had sex with Evel Knievel. Ha, ha.
953.701
952.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
955.120
Uh, we were friends in 1 992.
956.829
# AMANDA
956.997
No, I distinctly remember
you were dodging her calls...
960.166
960.334
...and trying to avoid seeing her.
962.502
# MONICA
963.629
You were going to cut me out?
965.693
# PHOEBE
965.693
Well, kind of.
967.757
# MONICA
967.925
Oh, my God.

Oh, bugger.

Should I not have said that? Unh!
I feel like a perfect arse.

988.486
988.779
Oh, my God, are you all right?
Yeah, I'll be right there.

Oh, I'm so sorry,
but Chandler was in a car accident.

It was right after
we were living together...
1107.897
1108.065
...and you were driving me crazy,
okay?

1110.109
You were really controlling
and compulsive and shrill.

Exactly. No matter what I tried to do,
I couldn't keep you out of my life.
1131.462
1131.630
Of all the people I've cut out...
1133.256
1133.423
...you were the only one
who ever clawed her way back in.
1136.717
1136.700

# MONICA
1138.887
That's because I'm scrappy.

# PHOEBE
1141.098
Yeah, you are, and I'm so glad that
you fought your way back in...

1155.362
Well, I guess we should go back in.

We should do the same for Amanda.

Does it look like this is
my first time, huh?

Hey, listen, can I ask you a question?
When you and Monica first hooked up...
1256.921
1257.089
...was it weird going from friends
to more than that?
1261.801
# CHANDLER
1262.678
Kind of. Sneaking around,
having to hide from you guys
1265.638
# RACHEL
1265.806
No, no, no. No, I mean...
1268.015
# JOEY
1268.183
...sexually.
1269.850
1270.300
**LOL**
1270.018
Yeah, uh, was there a part
of you that felt like it was...
1274.981
1275.148
...really wrong?
1277.400
# CHANDLER
1279.528
Actually, no.
No, it felt right, you know?
1282.363
1282.531
If felt like, uh:
1283.948
1284.116
"I can't believe we haven't
been doing this the whole time."
1286.826
# CHANDLER
1288.829
I can tell from your expressions that's
the good news you were hoping for.
1292.373
1292.600

Well, I'm gonna go continue
to spread the joy.
1299.880

Just because it happened that way
for them doesn't mean it has to for us.

# JOEY
1309.933
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
1311.600
1311.810
I mean, just because something's
difficult doesn't mean that you quit.
1315.271
# RACHEL
1315.439
Right, totally.
1316.293
# JOEY
1316.293

1317.148
1317.357
...we'll just keep trying
and trying until we do it.
