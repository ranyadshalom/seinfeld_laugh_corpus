# PHOEBE
13.596
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.
16.015
# JOEY
16.182
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited about the fact...
19.727
19.936
...that I just kissed her!
21.520

It's awesome!

# MONICA
150.817
You got it from Pottery Barn?
152.964
# RACHEL
152.964
Yeah. It's an apothecary table.
155.112
155.280
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?
157.656
# CHANDLER
157.824
A pharmacist.
159.575

166.456
# JOEY
166.624
I hate Pottery Barn too.
168.083
168.251
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.
171.503
# CHANDLER
171.671
You took off your pants
and got under the sheets.
174.381

182.222
# MONICA
182.390
She hates mass-produced stuff.
184.433
184.601
She thinks her furniture
should have a story behind it.
187.603
# RACHEL
187.770
This has a story behind it.
189.813
190.064
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.
194.401
194.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
196.946
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.
199.406
199.574
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?
203.619
# JOEY
203.786
Hey! I made that for her.
206.622
206.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
208.124
You made pottery?
208.957
# JOEY
208.957
Yeah.
209.791
209.959
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.
212.878
213.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
215.131
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.
218.508
# RACHEL
218.676
I'll tell her that it's an antique.
221.261
221.429
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.
223.430
223.598
Ah, I love these little drawers.
226.183
226.351
Oh, look!
It says that it holds 300 CDs.
229.436
# CHANDLER

Ah, just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

Thanks again, man.
265.681

If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

That'd be great!
270.937
270.937
Okay.
271.645

But at least let us
bring the wine.

# JOEY
300.049
What?
301.446
# JANINE
301.446
I can't handle two nights in a row...
302.843
303.011
...with them.
304.636
304.600
**LOL**
# JOEY
305.555
What's wrong with them?
307.180

Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just....
317.524

She's very loud for such
a small person.
320.485
320.800
**LOL**
# JOEY
323.865
Uh, they're my best friends.
326.116
326.284
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.
330.037
# JANINE
330.246
Of course we can still
hang out with them.
332.331
332.498
Just not two nights in a row.
335.208
337.003
Okay?
338.629

338.629
I guess.
340.255

390.556
Just only 500 bucks.

# PHOEBE
392.433
500 bucks at a flea market?

Oh, no.
400.858
# RACHEL
400.858
Yeah, no.

It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.
404.694
405.300
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
406.531
A dollar?
407.970
# RACHEL

And fifty?

409.900
**LOL**
409.575
So it was like
one and fifty dollars.
412.244
# PHOEBE
412.412
They gave you the old-time pricing.

Oh, good.
429.219
429.387
I bet it has a great story too.
431.596
431.764
Did they tell you
where it's from or....
433.890

472.472
I said ours was an original.
473.931

Why?

Can we cover this up, please?
493.742

Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

**LOL**
518.351
You know what I think?
She's just weird.
520.810

It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.
524.356

She's not weird. She likes

MONICA :
I can't believe this.
665.080
665.247
Who is she to judge us?
666.289
666.457
We couldn't have been nicer to her.
668.646

Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.
674.589
674.757
I'm sure she said it...
676.591
676.759
...because she was nervous 'cause
you're my best friends.
680.053
680.221
And it was our first date.
682.389
682.556
Plus, she's really sick.
685.350

**LOL**
# CHANDLER

You said you made that up!
689.479

better than the "play" thing?

They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

I looked like an idiot.

925.591
and I think you should
928.051

1035.617
# PHOEBE
1035.617
No, but I am mad.

Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...
1040.329
1040.497
...and it's in my living room...
1042.874
1043.042
