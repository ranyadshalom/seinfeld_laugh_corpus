Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.
8.549
8.800
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...
11.760
11.970
...for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?
15.723
16.100
**LOL**
# JOEY
16.558
Sure, neighbor. Come on in.
18.517
# CHANDLER
19.894
Is Janine around?
20.978
# JOEY
21.229
She's at dance class.
22.646
# CHANDLER
22.897
Can I check my room?
24.148
# JOEY
24.357
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.
27.234
28.100
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
31.031
Oh, my God.
32.614
32.824
It's like a guy never lived in here.
35.617
36.800
**LOL**
36.369
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.
40.122
# JOEY
40.790
It is?
41.832
42.300
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
42.292
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?
45.836
45.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
46.004
No.
47.004
# CHANDLER
47.213
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?
50.924
51.000
**LOL**
# JOEY
51.134
No.
51.655
# CHANDLER
51.655
No.
52.176
52.385
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?
55.637
55.847
This is a "guy's" place.
57.514
57.724
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.
60.851
61.300
**LOL**
# JOEY
62.187
You're right. I'll talk to her.
63.896
# CHANDLER
63.896
Talk to her. Be a man.
65.606
# JOEY
65.815
I'm a man.
66.732
# CHANDLER
66.732
Defend yourself.

How was breakfast with Hillary?
121.495
# MONICA
121.495
Okay.
122.496
122.705
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.
126.375
# CHANDLER
# ROSS
126.584
Is this Hillary,
your hot assistant chef, Hillary?
130.003
# MONICA
130.255
Yeah.
131.902
# ROSS
131.902
The one that stares at me?
133.549
133.600
**LOL**
# MONICA
134.008
No. The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.
137.719
138.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
138.429
Still, I could tell. She was into me.
141.140
142.200
**LOL**
143.351
Why don't you set us up?
144.643
# RACHEL
144.853
Ooh, are you setting Ross up
with someone?
146.562
146.729
Does she have a wedding dress?

# PHOEBE
152.861
Rachel, I'm making up flyers
to try to get new massage clients.
157.614
157.824
So can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copy machine?
160.450
# RACHEL
160.660
Well, sure, but they might think it's weird
considering I don't work there anymore.
165.038
165.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
165.957
Oh, my God. What happened?
168.000
# RACHEL
168.251
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.
170.127

You've lasted all year. Good for you.
180.387
181.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
183.349
But, Pheebs, you could still use
the copy machine where I actually work.
186.685
186.895
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.
189.646
189.898
Kim will freak out.
She already doesn't like me.
192.107
# CHANDLER
192.317
I don't think my boss likes me.
194.005
# MONICA
194.005
I don't think mine likes me either.
195.694
# ROSS
196.404
Maybe it's a universal thing.
198.780
# JOEY
198.990
Or maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 1 1 :30 on a Wednesday.
202.701
202.900
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
205.788
Yeah, let's head off to work.

# RACHEL
220.011
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?
222.012
# PHOEBE
222.222
Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.
224.306

You kissed him?
229.728
# PHOEBE
229.728
Totally.
230.479
# RACHEL
231.356
Phoebe, are you serious?
233.148
# PHOEBE
233.358
Yeah, I was just in there,
he came in and introduced himself.
235.859
236.110
The next thing I know,
we're making out.
239.363

Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

270.895
Do you, uh, know this kid?
Is it a relative?
273.689

# JANINE
273.898
No. I just thought it was cute.
275.816

276.025
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
Okay, uh....
279.194
278.400
**LOL**
279.362
Look, Janine, I really want you
to feel at home here, but...

...some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.
285.409

Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.
296.253
# JOEY

I don't know this baby.
I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.
300.799
301.400

303.136
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.
307.472
# JANINE
307.682
I'm sorry. I just thought
I'd try and make the place a little nicer.
310.934
# JOEY
311.144
Yeah, but it's too much stuff.
312.728
312.979
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.
317.274
317.700

317.483
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.
321.445

I just thought--
323.990

323.990
I'm sure it's a famous watering can.
325.824
325.700
**LOL**
326.034
But come on.
327.242
327.410
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?
330.579
331.200
**LOL**
# JANINE
331.664
It's a curling iron.

# JOEY
339.005
Oh. Well, that's okay then.
341.673
341.500
**LOL**
341.924
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...
345.344
345.595
...and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.
349.598
350.300
**LOL**
350.641
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

Yes, but I've really gotten in touch
with my feminine side enough today.

In fact, we're two sachets away

This has been kind of a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

# CHANDLER
689.939
It's okay. I just feel like I need
to be in a guy place...
692.482
692.733

# MONICA
694.902
Go over to Joey's and...
697.278

...drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

# CHANDLER
701.283
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

705.246
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

**LOL**
711.210
I'm sorry. We do. We do.

755.254
Uh, remember that thing that happened
yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.
759.299
# KIM
759.508
You didn't cancel the fabric order
from Taiwan?
761.926
# RACHEL
763.012
Okay, two things didn't happen.
765.305
765.400
**LOL**
765.598
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?
768.475
768.726
Well, it turns out that's not true.
771.227
# KIM
771.437
It's not true?
Oh, that's interesting.
773.480
# RACHEL
# KIM
773.689
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copy machine...
778.234
778.444
...yesterday during lunch,
and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.
781.112
# RACHEL
781.280
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God,
you think I made out with him?
784.532
# KIM
784.742
Listen to me, if you think sleeping
with Ralph is gonna get you my job...
788.036
788.204
...you are sadly mistaken.
789.788
# RACHEL
789.955
Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.
792.207
792.416
Oh, this is such a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.
794.751
795.002
Nobody made out with him.
I did not use my keycard yesterday.
798.880
799.131
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

# HILLARY
846.303
You know, you're a really great listener.

Okay. I'm from Long Island.
873.788
874.039
I came to the city for college.
876.666
874.700
**LOL**
876.834
Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...
881.671
881.922
...I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you. Hmm?
886.467
888.000
**LOL**
# JOEY
890.848
So if you sear the stems
of the flowers first in a frying pan...
895.310
895.519
...your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.
898.354
898.400

I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.
906.237

**LOL**
# MONICA
908.115
Okay, but, Joey, come over later.
910.033
910.200
I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...
912.035
912.202
...out of just a pine cone
and some peanut butter.
914.495
# JOEY

Aw. I love birds.

What?
922.504
# CHANDLER
922.504
You're arranging flowers.
923.338
924.924
You got dead flowers.
926.966
927.217
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers.
930.136
930.500

# JOEY
933.474
Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?
936.559
936.810
Flowers, they're just, you know,
nice to look at.
939.687
939.897
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.
944.442

You're turning into a woman.

Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

Why didn't you just tell the truth?
976.454
# RACHEL
976.454
I did.
977.725
977.935
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.
983.064
984.300
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
984.233
Well, what if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?
987.902
988.112
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?
991.906
992.157
Did she ever think of that?

The only thing you can do.
Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren.

...I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

"And you will never get promoted...

1166.540
...especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...
