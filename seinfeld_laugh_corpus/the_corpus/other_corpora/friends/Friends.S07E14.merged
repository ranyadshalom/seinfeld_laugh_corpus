# RACHEL
737.570
It was stupid to get upset
about not having a husband and kids.
740.321
740.573
All I really needed was a plan.
742.824
743.325
See, I wanna have three kids.
745.034
# PHOEBE
745.327
Let me guess. And you want to have them
all at the same time...
747.787
747.955
...and you want to have them
for your brother. Ha, ha.
750.331
750.400
**LOL**
# RACHEL
752.168
As I was saying....
753.835
754.336
I should probably have the first
of the three kids by the time I'm 35, right?
757.630
757.798
Which gives me five years.
759.966
# PHOEBE
# RACHEL
760.676
So if I wanna have a kid when I'm 35,
I don't have to get pregnant until I'm 34.
764.846
765.055
Which gives Prada four years
to start making maternity clothes.
768.767
770.000
**LOL**
771.687
Oh, wait, but I do want to be married
for a year before I get pregnant.

# RACHEL
788.496
So I don't have to get married
until I'm 33.
790.538
790.706
That's three years.
That's three whole years.
792.707
792.875
Oh, wait a minute though.
794.083
794.376
I'll need a year and a half
to plan the wedding.
797.462
797.300
**LOL**
798.214
And I'd like to know the guy
for like a year, year and a half...
801.132
801.383
...before we get engaged.
804.344
804.512
Which means I need to meet the guy
by the time I'm 30.
808.723
809.300

# ROSS
810.059
Which is fine,

No, Ross. No, it is not fine.
819.317

According to my plan, I should already
be with the guy that I'm gonna marry.

But you know what? You know what?

It's all okay.
It's okay, because I turned 30 today.
971.678
971.845
And I can do anything I want.
