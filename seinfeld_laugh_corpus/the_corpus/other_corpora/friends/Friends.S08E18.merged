Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary party?

# MONICA
# ROSS
7.215
Sure.
7.736
7.736
Yeah.
8.257
# JOEY

Who's the guy?
10.072
# PHOEBE
10.072
Parker, I met him at the dry cleaners.
11.719
# CHANDLER
12.303
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?
15.097
16.100
**LOL**
17.726
Who said that?
19.727
19.600
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
20.061
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.
24.982
25.275
And he treats me like a queen.
26.942
27.110
Except at night, when he treats me
like the naughty girl I am.
30.070
30.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
32.240
Oh, by the way, would it be okay
if I give the toast this year?
35.117
# ROSS
35.452
Are you sure you want to
after what happened at their 20th?
38.245
# MONICA
38.455
Yeah, I'd really like to.
40.706
# ROSS
40.706
Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.
42.958
43.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
43.209
Yes. Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.
48.589
48.798
This year, I'm gonna make them cry.

# CHANDLER
51.634
You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

**LOL**
# MONICA
54.637
No, really, any time Ross makes a toast,
everyone cries and pats him on the back.
59.808
59.000
**LOL**
60.018
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."
64.730
64.981
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."
69.318
70.000
**LOL**
# JOEY
70.820
Well, I can promise you,
at least one person will be crying.
73.822

I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.
78.243
# MONICA
78.453
Really? You can do that?

670.544
And they said even though they lost
their sight, it was all worth it.

# AUNTLISA

# RACHEL
676.904
Oh, well, I don't know about that.
678.593
678.844
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.
682.430
683.300
**LOL**
# WOMAN
684.225
How did you propose?
686.539
# RACHEL

Oh, yeah, that's a great story.
688.853

**LOL**
# ROSS
689.939
Well, um, actually,
I took her to the planetarium.
694.109
694.527
That's where we had our first date.
697.278
696.200
**LOL**
697.446
Um, she walked in, and I had the room
filled with, uh, lilies, her favorite flower.

AUNT LISA: That is so sweet.

# ROSS
709.125
Then Fred Astaire singing, uh,
"The Way You Look Tonight"...
712.794
712.962
...came on the sound system
and the lights came down...
715.880
716.048
...and I got on one knee...
717.215
717.466
...and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the
721.803
722.054
"Will you marry me?"
723.304
723.472
Aw.

731.021
Hey, uh, Phoebe? Look, uh...
734.274
735.818
...I want to apologize about before, okay?
We were being jerks.
739.487
739.739
Parker's a nice guy,
and I'd like to get to know him.
742.365
# PHOEBE
742.533
Then you better do it now.
743.783
# JOEY
743.993
Why?
745.223
# PHOEBE
745.223
Because I'm gonna kill him.

He's just too excited
about everything.
751.332
752.100
**LOL**
751.584
I mean, I'm all for living life, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

**LOL**
# JOEY
759.341
I know. I'm having the worst time.
761.342
761.510
There was a 1 5-minute line for the buffet,
and when I finally got up to the plates...
765.680
765.848
...I slipped on a giant booger.
769.100

Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

775.191
I guess it could've been.
I didn't really look at it.
778.067

I just wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out of there.
782.280
781.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
782.531
I just thought he was such a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.
790.079

There's nothing wrong with him.
He's a good guy.

You think?
793.875
# JOEY
793.875
Yeah, know what I think?
794.876
795.085
We were all just being too negative.
796.962
# PHOEBE
796.962
You're right.
798.838
799.089
You're right. He's just embracing life.
We could all stand to be more like Parker.
804.135
802.100
**LOL**
804.303
You know what? I am like him.
I'm a sunny, positive person.
807.889
# JOEY
808.349
Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.

# MONICA
824.990
Okay, it's time for the toast.
827.700
827.868
I know that normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'm gonna do it.
831.871
834.200
**LOL**
834.041
No, it's gonna be great. Really.
837.585
838.420
Okay, um....
839.838
840.089
Mom, Dad, when I got married...
844.425
844.677
...one of the things
that made me sure that I could do it...
848.096
848.264
...was the amazing example
the two of you set for me.
850.723
851.350
For that, and for so many other things,
I wanna say thank you.
855.019
855.229
I know I probably don't
say it enough...
858.815
859.650

When I look around this room...
875.123
875.291
...I'm saddened by the thought
of those who could not be with us.
879.168
879.461
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.
883.715
885.134
But she can't...
886.968
887.219
...because she's dead.

to her children in Terms of Endearment?

You want to hear something sad?
939.520
939.688
Um, the other day
I was watching 60 Minutes...
941.522
941.690
...and there was this piece
on these orphans in Romania...
944.192
944.000

...who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

Everything isn't perfect?
Everything isn't magical?

Everything isn't aglow
with the light of a million fairies?

Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.

Well, it's a good thing I didn't do it...
