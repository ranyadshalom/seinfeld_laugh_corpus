You said you'd marry Joey?

# RACHEL
6.131
Okay, you have to realize,
I was exhausted, I was emotional.
9.633
9.801
I would have said yes to anybody.
11.552
11.720
Like that time
when you and I got married.
14.680
14.500
**LOL**
16.641
I'm not helping.
18.600
18.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
19.060
So you said yes to him,
and you just had our baby?
23.355
# RACHEL
23.523
That is right. And traditionally,
the daddy gives the mommy a present.
27.776
27.944
But I am prepared to let that go.
29.903
30.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
31.072
So when I came here to see if you
wanted to maybe start things up again...
34.908
35.076
...you were engaged to my best friend?
38.412
38.580
Well
39.913
40.081
Really?
41.832
41.700
**LOL**
# RACHEL
42.083
I thought Chandler
was your best friend.
44.626
# ROSS
44.794
Well, Chandler's my oldest friend.
45.732
45.732
Mm-hm.
46.670
46.838
Joey's my-- No! Uh-uh!

Hey, I'm gonna take off.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

I don't want to be negative. So I'll say
most of the signs you bought are good.
117.908

# PHOEBE
121.079
No, they ran out of "It's a Girl!"
But I can fix this one.

It's okay.
144.810

Ross and Rachel will be back soon,
and then I gotta go to the office.
148.313

# CHANDLER
157.219
I couldn't sleep last night.
158.532
158.700
I started worrying about this big
divisional meeting I have today.
161.994
162.162
The more I worried,
the more I couldn't sleep.
164.329
164.497
You know, and then I was, like, "If I fall
asleep now, I'll get six hours' sleep.
168.417
168.585
But if I fall asleep now,
I'll get five hours' sleep."
171.670
171.838
No matter what I did,
I couldn't fall asleep.
174.089
# JOEY
174.257
You know what you should've done?
Told yourself that little story.

Oh.
191.732

Oh! Ha, ha.
192.941
193.109
Oh, my gosh. Look, there's something
every mother needs.
196.236
196.404
A giant, stuffed gorilla that takes up
the entire apartment.
200.782
200.950
What are people think--?
Oh, you guys, I love it.
206.163

Uh, he's downstairs getting the stuff
out of the cab.
211.835
# JOEY
212.003
Uh, is he still mad at us?
213.379
# RACHEL
213.379
Well, you more than me.
214.755
214.923
But he can't stay too mad at me.
I mean, I just had his baby. Ha, ha.
217.841
# JOEY
218.009
That's not fair. I can't do that.
220.260

**LOL**
# RACHEL
221.179
I'm not sure you should be here
when he comes up.
223.513
# JOEY
223.681
I didn't think I should be here either.
But somebody said he'd be over it.
227.809
# CHANDLER

Hey, what do I know?
I wanted to get a bigger gorilla.

# MS.MCKENNA
236.861
The numbers we're seeing in Chicago,
New York and London are solid.
240.656

But many of our field offices
have reported disappointing yields.
245.118

**LOL**
# MS.MCKENNA
251.000
Boston is down. Atlanta is down.
Houston is down.
253.669
253.836
I could go on and on.
But instead of boring you...
256.838
257.006
...I'll go straight to my 42-point plan.

She's just so cute.
276.233

Oh, I just want to bite her ear off
and use it as a sucking candy.
280.153
280.321
Mm-hm.

281.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
282.240
Phoebe. Ha, ha.
283.782
283.950
But I could take one of those little feet
and put it in a pita pocket.
286.785
288.100
**LOL**
# ROSS
288.997
Okay. I put most of the stuff away.

No, I, uh, left the diapers
at the hospital.

There's some in the bag,
but I'll run out and get some more.
309.891

310.059
All right, thanks. Oh, could you stop
at the coffeehouse and get me a muffin?

315.585

What do I want?

# ROSS
323.072
Please, take your time.
It's an important decision, not like...
326.158

someone. This is about a muffin.

It says to try holding the baby
close to your body...

...and then swing her rapidly
from side to side.

...picked up my grandmother's ring and
you "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.
559.099
# JOEY

Can I just stop you there
for a second?

I don't really know what that means.

You were saying?
572.362
# ROSS
572.530
And I could even understand
that you couldn't tell Rachel.

But why couldn't you tell me, huh?
You had all day to, and you didn't.

Oh, I'm kind of part of this.
705.704

# CHANDLER
708.040
Actually, it's a husband-and-wife
kind of thing.
710.333

710.501
I knew I should've married Chandler.
713.002

# MONICA
714.630
MONICA: Okay, what's up?
715.985
# CHANDLER
715.985
Okay. Um, ahem.
717.340
717.508
You know we said it would be fun
to move to Paris for a year?
720.468
720.636
And you could study French cooking,
and I could write...
723.763
723.931
...and we could picnic along the Seine,
and go wine-tasting in Bordeaux.
727.392
# MONICA
727.560
Oh, yeah.
728.832
# CHANDLER
728.832
Okay.
730.103
730.271
You know how people say
that Tulsa...
733.314
733.400
**LOL**
735.192
...is the Paris of Oklahoma?
737.318
737.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
739.739
What? Who says that?
741.406
# CHANDLER
742.575
People who have never been
to Paris?

Well, what's going on?
747.287
# CHANDLER

We're moving to Tulsa.

# MONICA
752.877
Excuse me?
754.044
# CHANDLER
754.044
Okay.
755.211
755.379
Ms. McKenna, she kind of,
uh, works above my boss
757.714
758.174
She asked me to move to Tulsa and
be president of our office there.
761.551
761.719
And I was sleeping
and apparently said yes.
764.929
765.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
765.097
Tulsa, Oklahoma?
766.890
# CHANDLER

The Sooner State.

# MONICA
772.521
Chandler, I don't even want to see
the musical Oklahoma.
775.565
# CHANDLER
775.733
"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin"'?
"Surrey With the Fringe on Top"?
778.610
# MONICA
778.778
Are you trying to tell me we're moving
to Oklahoma or that you're gay?
782.781
782.400
**LOL**
784.867
All right, not that this matters, but did
they at least offer you a huge raise?
788.703
# CHANDLER
788.871
No. But they are going to lease us
a Ford Focus.
793.208
792.800

I'll get out of it.
795.898

What is wrong with Emma?
799.423
# MONICA
799.423
Oh, she misunderstood.

# CHANDLER
807.223
Ma'am, uh, do you have a minute?
809.933

I kind of have some bad news.
I don't think I can move to Tulsa.

818.150
Ha, ha. Ahem.
819.734
819.200
**LOL**
819.902
Um, I kind of fell asleep
in the meeting this morning.
823.738
823.906
So when I said I'd move to Tulsa,
I didn't really know what I was saying.
827.408
# MS.MCKENNA
827.576
You fell asleep?
828.827
# CHANDLER
828.994
But only because I was up all night
worried about this meeting.
831.996
832.164
Isn't that funny?
833.832
833.800
**LOL**
835.042
Irony. Not a fan? All right.
837.710
838.100
**LOL**
839.713
See, here's the thing.
841.047
841.215
I went home and told my wife
about Tulsa, and she won't go.
844.843
845.010
See me, I love Tulsa. Tulsa is heaven.
Tulsa is Italy.
848.429
848.597
Please don't make me go there.
851.015

Chandler, I--
851.954
# CHANDLER

No, no, no.
852.725
852.935
Look, Carol. Can I call you Carol?
856.062
857.398
Why would I
when your name is Elaine?
859.858
860.100
**LOL**
862.695
Sorry. Oh!

What a great picture of your son.

Well, she's lovely.
I like a girl with a strong jaw.

You, uh, want me to help you with that?

# ROSS
992.616
I don't think that we are.

But you two are supposed
to be together.

# ROSS
999.081
Well, I thought so too.
But then she said she'd marry you.
1002.375
# JOEY
1002.960
Come on, Ross,
that didn't mean anything.
1005.086
1005.254
She'd just had the baby. She was
all freaked out about doing it alone.
1008.798
1006.000
**LOL**
1008.966
She would have said yes to anybody.
1010.654
# ROSS
1010.654
Yeah, that's what she said.
1012.343
# JOEY
1012.511
So?
1014.158
# ROSS
1014.158
So I don't want to be just anybody.

You know what?
1020.601
1020.769
It's better this way anyway.
1023.855
1025.232
I don't know what I was thinking,
going down that road again with us.
1028.443
1028.610
It's just much easier if we're
just friends who have a kid.
1033.865
# JOEY
1034.033
Really?
1034.720
# ROSS
1034.720

1035.576
And you're okay with that?
1037.890
# ROSS
1037.890
Yes. That's what we always planned.
1040.204
1040.372
And if you have a plan,
you should stick to it.
1042.832
1043.000
That's why they call them plans.
