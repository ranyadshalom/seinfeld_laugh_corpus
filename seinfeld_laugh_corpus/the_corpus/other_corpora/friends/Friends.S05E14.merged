Yeah, hey, then we could do
that telephone thing...
35.284
35.493
...you know, where you have a can,
we have a can...
38.120
38.329
...and it's connected by a string.
40.539
40.600

Monica and Chandler were, like...
187.186
187.395
...doing laundry
or going grocery shopping...?

190.815
All that time Monica spent on the phone

We were at Ugly Naked Guy's apartment
and saw them doing it through the window.

Yes, but you know what?
It doesn't matter who knows what.
233.232

Now enough of us know
that we could just tell them we know.
236.610
236.861
Now all the lying and the secrets
will finally be over.
239.821

I've already looked at
like a thousand apartments this month.
661.326
661.577
None of them even compares
to that one.
663.870
# RACHEL
664.497
You know what you should do?
665.747
# ROSS
# RACHEL
665.956
You should find out what his hobbies are
and then use that to bond with him.
670.126
670.336
Yeah. Like if I wanted something
from Joey...
672.295
672.505
...I would strike up a conversation
about, say, um, sandwiches...
676.675
678.300
**LOL**
679.053
...or, uh, my underwear.
680.762
# JOEY
681.764
I'm listening.
683.139

686.017
# ROSS
686.227
That is a great idea.
688.603
688.813
And I know Ugly Naked Guy because
we've been watching him for five years.
693.400
693.609
So that gives me back my edge. Ha, ha.
697.362
697.400
**LOL**
697.530
Let's see now. He had the trampoline.
700.031
# PHOEBE
700.241
But he broke that.
701.388

Hey, didn't he used to have a cat?
716.923
# PHOEBE
717.133
I wouldn't bring that up.
It would probably just bum him out.
