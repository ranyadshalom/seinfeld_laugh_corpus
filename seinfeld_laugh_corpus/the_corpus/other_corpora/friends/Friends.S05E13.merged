wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."
250.457
251.084

If anybody was looking
for the best bad massage...
904.193
904.445
...and they thought, "Who's the best?"

906.906
They'd have to go to you.

Huh.
913.369

It would be you!

1006.672
So question
1008.589
1009.299
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?
1013.136
# FRANKSR.
1013.387
Yes, I was.
1015.388
# PHOEBE
1015.556
Okay, um, question
1017.245
1017.245
Um, did that marriage end...

1019.184
...A, happily...
1020.768
1021.061
...B, medium...
1023.312

...or, C, in the total abandonment...
1026.733
1024.800
**LOL**
1026.984
...of her and her two children?
1029.027
# FRANKSR.
1029.903
It really says that?
1031.112

1031.363
Yeah, see?
1032.447
1033.000
**LOL**
# FRANKSR.
1034.491
I guess then I would have to say C.
1036.826

1038.495
Total abandonment.

I don't want the lipstick that much.
1057.889

Would you do me a favor?
1062.935
1063.187
Would you give Lilly...
1064.896
1065.856
...that, please?
1066.815
# PHOEBE
1066.815
What?
1067.774
# FRANKSR.
1067.983
When you see Lilly, give her that note.
1070.193
1070.402
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...
1072.862
1073.363
...but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.
1078.117
1078.827
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?
1081.329
# PHOEBE
1081.580
But you came to see Lilly?
1084.165
# FRANKSR.
1085.209
Yeah. Why?
1086.250
# PHOEBE
1087.336
Lilly's dead.

1093.884
Are you sure?
1094.967

If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

1099.681
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe

Seventeen years ago.

Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.
1120.701

It's just, I don't know what to say.

I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.
1159.448

Would it make you feel
better if I said...

# PHOEBE
1170.752
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.
1173.963
1174.214
So you can just go.
1175.673
# FRANKSR.

I was a lousy father.

Yes, it is.
1185.433
1185.684
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.
1189.687
1189.938
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

But it was stupid.
