Monica and I are celebrating
our 1 0-month anniversary.

Got reservations at Jean-George.

10.634
Wow.

12.137
How'd you get in?
12.658
# CHANDLER
12.658
Oh.
13.178
13.388
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...
15.472
15.640
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.
18.475

Hi, Chandler.

# CHANDLER
23.981
Hey, Caitlin.
24.773
24.983
Somebody got a haircut.
26.150
# CAITLIN
26.359
Ugh. I hate it. I look like
an 8-year-old boy.
28.777
# CHANDLER
28.987
If that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.
31.447
32.400
**LOL**
# CAITLIN
35.035
It's, uh, $27 even.
36.327
36.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
36.327
Oh, okay. Here you go.
37.619
# CAITLIN
38.997
Where's the chicken?
40.080
# CHANDLER
40.331
Oh, it's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.
43.125
43.300
**LOL**
43.293
He said that eggs came first.
44.793
# CAITLIN
44.961
Ha, ha, thanks. I'll see you later.
46.525

# CHANDLER
54.387
What?
55.200
# ROSS
55.200
The flirting.
56.013
56.264
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, hmm, let's see, my sister?
59.725
60.200
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
60.685
I was not flirting.
61.769
# ROSS
61.978
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut...."
65.189
67.200
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
68.485
First of all, the impression? Uncanny.
71.653
72.100
**LOL**
72.363
Second, that wasn't flirting. That was just
casual conversation between two people.
76.325
# ROSS
76.534
Oh! Yeah, right.
78.160
78.500
**LOL**

138.762
# PHOEBE
138.762
I know.
139.805
140.014
But don't you think it should
be called Order and Law?
143.809
143.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
143.977
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.
146.311
# PHOEBE
146.479
Yeah. Don't get me started on that.
148.230
148.500

Chandler was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.
157.406
# CHANDLER
157.615
I was not. And oh, God! Shh!
160.826
161.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
161.244
I'm sorry, but you were. And besides,
if anyone should be hitting on her...
164.788
164.956
...it's the guy who's single...
166.456
166.624
...the guy who can do something about it.
168.750
# PHOEBE
168.918
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

You like Caitlin?

# RACHEL
178.678
Ha, ha, Ross, we broke up two years
ago. You've been married since then.
183.599
183.766
I think it's okay
that we see other people.
186.226

Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

I know she's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?
204.286
205.900
**LOL**
205.830
She forgot my vegetarian.
207.623
# ROSS
208.291
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.
212.211
212.462
And when she does,
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.
215.881
217.000
**LOL**
217.550
Oh, I am so glad you don't eat meat.

Chandler, she doesn't understand
a word of English.

Ha, ha, I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.
238.195

So, uh-- Ahem.
You flirt with guys all the time?
497.996

498.623
Sure. lt doesn't mean anything. Just like
I know it doesn't mean anything with you.
502.792
# CHANDLER
503.002
But there's a big difference.
You're a lot hotter.

# CHANDLER
510.218
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.
512.761
513.012
When you were going out with Ross, did it
bother you when he flirted with other women?
517.057
# RACHEL

Uh, no. No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

Hmm?

652.234
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.
654.736
# PHOEBE
655.655
But I already gave them back to you.

Okay, we have 1 0 minutes.
Do you want me to get into that now?

Hey, Pheebs.
690.063

How's that, uh...
691.856
692.024
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you, huh?
695.318
695.200
**LOL**
697.154
You and those, uh, vegetables

707.998
Do you like it?
709.916
710.900
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
711.919
No. That would be,
"Why are you being cute?"
713.920
715.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
715.256
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.
717.298

# CHANDLER
721.929
So, uh, Monica, do you like
Law and Order?
724.180
# MONICA
724.390
Yeah, it's good.
725.015
# CHANDLER
725.015
Oh.
725.640
725.808
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order...
728.810
728.978
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.
731.396
731.564
Shh. Shh.
733.440
732.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
735.151
Okay, let me get this straight.
736.735
736.902
It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?
739.821
# CHANDLER
740.030
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.
741.823
742.400
**LOL**
742.742
Look, I'm sorry, but some things
are different for men and women.
746.411
# MONICA
746.620
Go on, teach me about men and women.
748.413
# CHANDLER
748.622
Okay. I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.
751.583
752.200
**LOL**
752.960
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, "No big deal."
755.545
755.713
But the guy thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."
759.382
759.800
**LOL**
# MONICA
759.592
No way!
760.592
# CHANDLER
760.592
It's true.
761.593
# MONICA
762.261
Well, that's pathetic.
763.512
# CHANDLER
763.512
Again, true.

# CHANDLER
767.370
All guys that are awake.
768.933
769.500
**LOL**
769.685
Then we go to sleep.
770.769
770.936
All guys from the other end of the world
wake up and behave the exact same way.
774.981
775.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
776.233
All right. It's another commercial

779.194
# ROSS

You are not gonna run out

All right, well, I mean, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.

I'll replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.

Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.
