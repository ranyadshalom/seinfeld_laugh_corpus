Uh, this guy at work got me excited...
153.235
153.444
...about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?
156.613
156.823
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.

I think real estate is

# PHOEBE
612.778
Um, okay.
613.862
614.030
Well, all right.
Um, originally, I'm from upstate...
617.532
617.742
...but, um, then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.
620.994
621.203
So I moved to the city...
623.622
622.500
**LOL**
623.789
...where, um, I lived in a burned-out
Buick LeSabre for a while.
626.833
627.043
Which was okay. That was okay.
628.543
628.711
Until, um, I got hepatitis, you know...
630.712
630.921
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and....
634.841
631.600
**LOL**
635.500
**LOL**
636.218
But I got over it.

637.845
And, um, anyway, now I'm a, um,
freelance massage therapist...
642.265
642.433

but at least I don't pay taxes.

# THEODORE
702.805
No, I'll be fine.
703.660

I just should check the stitches.

Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.

# MIKE
721.303
But, I mean, you have met
humans before, right?
723.930
724.000
**LOL**
724.515
Why don't you go talk to my mom?
726.349
# PHOEBE
726.559
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.

You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

# PHOEBE
748.726
It's a testament to how he was raised.
750.957
751.167
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.
754.210
# BITSY
754.420
Is he really?
756.630
# PHOEBE
756.630
He is so considerate of my feelings.
758.840
759.049
You know, I think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.
763.428

Excuse me?

No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.
772.896
773.500
**LOL**
773.105
When he gets going...
774.731
774.940
...he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.

I mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?

Did you take that tape?
813.895
# CHANDLER
814.104
I had to! Imagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife...
817.607
817.817
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?
821.361

# CHANDLER
834.708
All right, I'm gonna watch it.
835.959
837.336
I mean, it's probably
not even what I think it is.
839.420
839.630
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.
843.216
843.384
Ha, ha. Can it?
845.218
845.800
**LOL**
# JOEY
846.762
See, in my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped...
850.265
850.474
...she doesn't say no to much else,
I'll tell you.
853.017
852.800
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
855.396
Then you have to watch it for me.
856.522
# JOEY
856.522
Whoa! What?
857.647
# CHANDLER
857.857
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. Please?
860.525

All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!

Why am I hearing cheering?

It's okay. It's just a football game.

# CHANDLER
875.791
It's just football?

You were all worried for nothing.

# CHANDLER
879.712
It's football! It's just football!

This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed football!
884.924
885.100

to get a beer!

...only offensive novelty rap?
925.173
924.800

925.382
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.
929.010

With an itty-bitty waist

Because that's who I am. Okay?
1152.942
1153.300
**LOL**
1153.527
I'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.
1157.196
1157.406
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...
1159.240
1159.449
...for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.
1163.828
1163.400

Is all of this about you not being able

# CHANDLER
1169.251
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.

He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.

# MONICA
1175.382
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?
