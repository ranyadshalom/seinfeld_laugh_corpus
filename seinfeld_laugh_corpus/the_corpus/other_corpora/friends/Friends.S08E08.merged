Oh. Why not?
25.816
# RACHEL

Because I know he's gonna flip out

Oh, Rachel.
This is all so "Papa Don't Preach."

No, Pheeb, wait, he's a scary guy.
I mean, one time he caught me smoking.
35.868

He said if he ever saw me doing that again,
he would make me eat the entire pack.

...but, oh, I wasn't allowed to.
All we got was a stupid steak dinner.

# DR.GREEN
179.303
Seventy-four?
180.679
180.930
I ordered the '75. That's a magnificent wine.
The '74 is sewage.
185.309
182.000
**LOL**
185.518
Why would you bring me sewage?
187.102
187.700

188.855
Is that a hard question? Are you an idiot?
Is that why you're a waiter?
192.816
# WAITER
193.026
This is why I told the manager
I wouldn't wait on you tonight.

Oh, come on.
Don't be such a baby.

He's right, though.
The '74 is absolute piss.

Rachel--
215.694
# RACHEL
215.694
No, it's okay. This is what's gonna happen.
216.757
216.925
I'm gonna wait a couple of years
and then the baby will tell him.
221.345
221.000
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
221.971
Why? So he can get mad at the baby?
224.494
# RACHEL
224.494
Hey, that is the baby's problem.
227.017
227.100

I'm not a bachelor anymore.
423.171
422.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
423.423
So don't think of it as a bachelor party.
425.048
425.216
Think of it as a two-month
anniversary present.

Uh, actually, sorry, I can't even make it.
I'm seeing Mona again tonight.

700.324
Yes. Ahem.
702.117

Yes, yes, I did, but it was
just a one-night thing. It meant nothing.

Oh? Really? That's what my daughter
means to you, nothing?

No, no, sir. Um, she means a lot to me.

# DR.GREEN
720.677
Oh, really? That's how you treat a friend?

Wait, wait.
Maybe she's a hooker and a stripper...
746.828
746.996
...but she got confused
about what she's supposed to do.
750.206
749.900

Could be. I mean, technically, she did strip.

# HOOKER
762.720
Uh, no, but I could pretend to strip.
765.180
765.347
But that's gonna cost extra.

766.807
Okay, here's the
767.933
767.933

Maybe Monica's playing a joke on you.

You know, getting her own husband
a hooker. That's pretty funny.
779.068

That is funny. Maybe for my birthday
she'll murder someone.

802.885
# DR.GREEN
802.885
But what?
804.260
804.428
You figured you'd get what you wanted,
then you'd dump her like Rachel.

Hey, I did not dump Rachel.
Nor are we still together.

My husband.
847.450
# STU
847.450
You hired your husband a hooker?

She's a stripper.
851.204
# STU

No, she's a hooker.
852.433
# MONICA
853.310
Is that what they call strippers sometimes?

# STU
855.145
When they're hookers.

**LOL**
# MONICA
857.189
Oh, my God, Stu,
I can't believe you did this.
860.400
860.609
You're absolutely sure she's a hooker?
862.569
# STU
862.820
Either that, or she's just the best,
most expensive date I ever had.
866.531
867.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
870.661
Maybe she meant to get you a hooker.
873.351
# CHANDLER
873.351
Why would she do that?
876.040
# JOEY
876.292
Maybe she wants you
to learn something.
878.126
878.700
**LOL**

Is there anything you're really bad at,
you know, sexually?

What's gonna happen in a minute?

All right, all right.
Maybe you should just ask her to leave.
899.439
# CHANDLER
899.690
Why me?
900.691
# JOEY
900.691
Hey, it's your bachelor party.
901.691
# CHANDLER
902.151
Which is why you should do it.

Remember?
You and me used to be inseparable.
930.303
930.554
Well, now it's like things are different.
935.266

935.517
Well, you know, things are different.
I'm married now.

Yeah, sure. And, hey, don't get me wrong,
I am so happy for you guys.

Just us, you know?
948.613
# CHANDLER
949.740
Yeah, I miss that too.

# RACHEL
1047.588
I know. Mona, just hear me out.
1049.547
1049.798
First of all, I am so sorry
about my father yelling at you.
1053.718
1053.927
But I heard that you totally
held your own.
1055.595
1055.763
You're gonna have to tell me
how you did that.

1062.643
1063.562
And yes, we are gonna have a baby.
1066.898
1067.149
But we are definitely not
getting back together.
1071.110
# MONA
1071.361
How can I be sure of that?
1073.280
# RACHEL
1073.280
Oh, because we drove each other crazy.
1075.198
# ROSS
# RACHEL
1075.365
I mean, he was possessive, he was jealous.
He could never just let the little things go.
1081.245
# ROSS
1081.497
Trying to date this woman.
1082.310
# RACHEL
1082.310
Right.
1083.122
1083.400
**LOL**
1083.290
But none of that compared
to how kind and gentle...
1088.336
1088.545
...and thoughtful he is.
1090.755
# ROSS
1091.006
You probably shouldn't touch me.
1093.591
1093.200

You know, I just don't wanna get
in the middle of something so complicated.
1097.929
# RACHEL
1098.138
I get it. But, Mona,
what relationship is not complicated?
1101.516
1101.767
We all have our baggage.
You must too.
1104.602
1104.853
Why else would you still be single?
1106.479
1108.190
I'm so gonna leave right now.
1109.482
1110.100
**LOL**
# ROSS
1113.779
Should I leave this open for you too?
1115.822
# MONA
1116.657
I'm not sure yet.
Why didn't you just tell me about all this?
1120.409
# ROSS
1120.619
Because what's going on with Rachel has
nothing to do with how I feel about you.
1123.830
# MONA
1124.081
Well, you still should have told me.
1126.332
# ROSS
1126.332
I know, and I was going to...
1128.584
1128.794
...but I thought it was better
that you heard it from Rachel's father.
1132.713
1132.600
**LOL**
1134.424
Look, I made a mistake...
1136.259
1136.510
...but it's only because
I really, really like you. Really.
