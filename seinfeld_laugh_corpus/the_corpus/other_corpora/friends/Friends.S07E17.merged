And we'll see who she likes best.
690.438
# JOEY
691.524
That sounds fair.
693.817
693.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
694.151
Maybe I'll take her
to that new French restaurant down the street.
697.862
# JOEY
698.072
Wait a second.
We have to set a spending limit on the date.
701.533
701.701
I don't have the money to take her
to a fancy place like that.
704.577
# ROSS
704.787
Well, sorry.
That's what I do on dates.
708.665
# JOEY
708.874
All right. Well, I guess I'll just have to do
what I do on dates.
713.461
709.500

713.100
**LOL**
# ROSS
719.093
So let's decide on a spending limit.

Yeah.
722.595
722.000
**LOL**
723.180
Uh....
724.472
726.350
And a slice....
729.060
728.600
**LOL**
730.479
Six dollars?
732.439
732.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
733.941
I was thinking more like a hundred.
735.567
# JOEY
735.567
Okay.
737.193
737.445
Can I borrow 94 dollars?

You listen here, missy!

**LOL**
# PHOEBE
773.981
What?
774.981
# MONICA
775.191
That was Megan. She booked The Swing Kings
on the day of our wedding...
778.651
778.819
...and said she'd only
give them back for the dress!
781.404
# PHOEBE
783.115
Does that mean Carcass is available?
786.117

What am I gonna do? That's the dress!
That is "the" dress!
792.248

Chandler wants the band.
What do I do?
796.294
# PHOEBE
796.504
Figure out a way to talk him out of it.

We have 8:00 reservations
at Grand Merci Bistro.
821.069
# JOEY
821.278
That's in 20 minutes.
You'd better get dressed.
824.614

826.075
I am dressed.
827.847

For me.
831.871

833.916
What's this?
Did you give yourself a facial?
836.793

837.002
I have an oily T-zone.

Okay, dude.
842.715

Hey, you sent Kristen flowers?
847.158
# ROSS
847.158
That's right.
848.596
# JOEY
849.181
You spent 1 00 dollars.
That's the limit. You're screwed!
853.643
853.600
**LOL**
# ROSS
854.478
Actually, I sent the flowers before
the actual date, so technically...
859.482
859.650
...technically, I didn't break any rules.
Thanks for stopping by though.
864.028
# JOEY
864.238
That's how it's gonna be?
I can break the rules too.
867.657
# ROSS
867.867
What are you gonna do?
869.139
# JOEY
869.139
I don't know.
870.410
870.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
870.661
I'm not surprised.
872.162
# JOEY
872.162
You won't get away with this.
873.663
# ROSS
873.873
You don't have much choice.
874.707
# JOEY
874.707
We'll see!
875.540

875.708
Bye-bye.

Yeah, bye-bye.

879.712
Hey! So just a light layer?

Yeah, just here and there.

Joey got meat sauce

Swing music is so out.
898.271
# MONICA

Phoebe, he's gotta be in the room
for that to work.
901.941
901.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
902.860
What are you guys talking about?
905.320
# MONICA
905.529
We're talking about The Swing Kings...
908.031
908.282
...and whether they're
the right way to go.
910.992
# RACHEL
911.201
I went to a wedding
where they had swing music...
913.870
914.038
...and two months later
the couple divorced.
916.497
917.900
**LOL**
917.791
I'm not saying
there's any connection here...
921.169
921.420
...but they did tell me
that's why they got divorced.
924.756
924.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
926.425
But I love swing music!
928.134
# PHOEBE
928.344
But The Swing Kings?
930.011
930.262
They suck so much that people actually die
at their concerts. They just stop living.
935.642
935.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
936.435
When Monica and I went to see them,
we had fun.
939.729
939.980
And there's another reason.
941.689
# RACHEL
941.899
Well, what is the other reason?
944.046
# CHANDLER
944.046
I don't want to say.
946.194
945.700
**LOL**
# RACHEL
946.403
Well, you have to,
because maybe it's stupid.
949.989
949.800
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
951.617
It's just while Monica and I
were dancing to them...
955.870
956.121
...it was the first time
I knew that...
959.290
959.875
...you were the woman that I wanted
to dance all my dances with.
964.337

Is your back feeling better?
982.626
# ROSS
982.626
Yeah, it's fine.
984.232
984.441
I guess, ahem, the more muscles you have...
987.235
987.486
...the more they can
spasm out of control.

I used to have a friend named Joey.

So Joey, you look familiar.
1035.908
1036.160
Are you on TV or something?
1038.870
# KRISTEN
1039.079
Joey doesn't like to talk about it...
1041.289
1041.540
...but he's one of the stars
of Days of Our Lives.
1044.959
1045.200
**LOL**
# ROSS
1045.836
That's right. That's right.
Don't you play a woman?
1050.006
1050.200
**LOL**
# JOEY
1052.968
A woman in a man's body.
1056.054
# ROSS
1056.305
Much better.
1058.389
1058.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
1059.516
So, Ross, it's funny, because you
look familiar to me too.
1062.602
1062.853
Have you ever been married?
1065.354
1065.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
1067.107
Yes, I have.
1068.149
1068.400
In fact, just the other day...
1070.651
1070.861
...Kris and I talked about how
I've been married and have a son.
1075.031
# KRISTEN
1075.282
Yeah, little Eric.
1077.304
# ROSS
1077.304
That's right. Wait. No, Ben.
1079.327
1080.100
**LOL**
# JOEY
1081.955
So you've just been married
the one time then?
1085.166
1085.400
**LOL**
# ROSS
1087.461
Well, um....
1089.379
# KRISTEN
1089.379
You've been married twice?
1091.297
# ROSS
1091.507
Yes. And...
1095.259
1093.300
**LOL**
1095.469
...another time after that.
1098.179
1097.900
**LOL**
1100.224
Boy, I'm getting hungry.
1103.226
1102.400
**LOL**
1103.477
Ahem. Hey, Joey, have you ever been
so hungry on a date...
1106.562
1106.814
...that when the girl goes to the
bathroom, you eat some of her food?
1111.234
1111.400
**LOL**
# KRISTEN
1113.654
You said the waiter ate my crab cake.
1116.948
1116.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
1119.034
So, Ross, now why did
that first marriage break up? Hm?
1123.913
1124.100
**LOL**
1124.581
Was it because the woman was straight
or because she was a lesbian?
1129.210
1128.600
**LOL**
# KRISTEN
1130.712
Do you two know each other?

1132.318
No.
1133.923
1133.600
**LOL**
# JOEY
1134.133
But he seems like
a guy who'd marry a woman...
1136.968
1137.177
...on the verge of being a lesbian
and then push her over the edge.
1141.722
1141.100

1144.643
Wait a minute!
Were you on a poster for gonorrhea?

Have you ever slept
in the same bed with a monkey?

Fine! You ever gotten stuck
in a pair of your own leather pants?
1161.868

# MONICA
1207.497
No. I'm wearing a wedding dress.

1213.149
# CHANDLER
1213.149
Then why can't I see it?
1214.962
# MONICA
1215.214
Oh. I guess you can.
1217.048
1217.299
But I have to return it,
so you can't like it.
1220.426
# CHANDLER
1220.636
Okay, I promise. I'll hate it.
1223.846
1223.600

Wow. You look hideous.

# MONICA
1234.233
Really?
1235.483

Yeah. That's like the most
ugliest dress I've ever seen.
1240.613
1240.600
**LOL**
1240.822
Why do you have to return it?
1242.865
# MONICA
1243.075
Because it doesn't really fit.
1246.035
1246.286
Oh, by the way, I booked The Swing Kings.
1248.329
# CHANDLER
1248.538
Oh, that's great. Great. Thanks.
1251.457
1251.667
But that dress, I mean, it's like, ugh, terrible.
1254.377
1254.586
It makes me want to rip it right off you.
1256.358
# MONICA
1256.358
Okay.
1258.130
1258.400
**LOL**
1258.340
But you can't rip it.
1260.049
1260.300
Well, maybe a little.
