My hand feels weird.
14.430

I guess it's because I'm engaged.

# CHANDLER

Already?

# RACHEL
26.234
Yeah, we got a lot to do.
We gotta think about the flowers...
28.777
28.945
...the caterers, the music
30.362
# CHANDLER
30.530
Oh, I got some thoughts on the music--

Chandler, too many cooks....

Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and try to say the right name.

**LOL**
# MONICA
42.292
Okay.
43.709
# CHANDLER

What in God's name is that?

# ROSS
45.524
Oh, my God, the wedding book?

I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.

This baby has everything.
Take, you know, locations for

First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...
59.099
59.309
...then by square footage.

**LOL**
# PHOEBE
62.645
That is so smart. Ha.
65.606
65.815
Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.
68.275
108.600
**LOL**
# ROSS
108.900
And that should conclusively prove...
110.901
111.194
...that I had the idea
for Jurassic Parkfirst.
114.905
114.800
**LOL**

Hey, Ross.
117.032
# ROSS
117.200
Phoebe, oh, my God,
what are you doing here?
119.451
# PHOEBE
119.619
I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.
123.122
# ROSS
123.373
Oh, my God. Um, of course.
125.541
125.708
Uh, would you please excuse me
for a moment?
128.335
128.503
Um, heh, do you know each other's
hometowns? Why don't you...?

133.200
**LOL**
133.508
What's going on?
134.925
# PHOEBE
135.135
Well, um, not much. I was just thinking
that since those guys just got engaged...
139.721
137.900
**LOL**
140.014
...that maybe it'd be nice
if they had some privacy.
142.224
142.433
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?
146.103
147.600
**LOL**
147.564
Um....
148.897
# ROSS
149.065
Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?
152.734
# PHOEBE
152.944
Nothing. Why?
155.154
156.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
157.407
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.
158.907
# PHOEBE
159.117
Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies
and it starts in like five minutes.

All right, um, a string quartet for the

# RACHEL
# MONICA
188.313
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing....

Well, you couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek....

# CHANDLER
208.124
Why are you napping over here
instead of over at your place?
211.293
# JOEY
211.461
The duck.
212.524
# RACHEL
212.524
What, the duck?
213.587
213.796
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?
216.131
216.500
**LOL**
# JOEY
217.091
Uh, well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...
221.470
221.721
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.
224.973
225.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
226.434
Now, do I get to look at this book...
227.893
228.061
...or is it just for people who are actually
involved in the wedding?
231.355
232.000

# MONICA
232.315
Of course you can look at it.
Yeah, I want your opinion too.

Okay.
235.818

What do you think about centerpieces?
238.132
# CHANDLER
238.132
Centerpieces.
239.404
# MONICA
239.656
Roses or lilies?
241.157
# CHANDLER
241.157
Definitely roses.
242.658
245.000
**LOL**
246.996
Well, I just think they're a bit more
wedding-y, you know.
250.332

But lilies are the clear choice.

Okay. I will find someplace else

417.499
417.792
I just don't know what the big deal is.

There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.
495.952

It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

We have it.
Only now we call it "the beach house."

I can't believe you spent my wedding fund
on the beach house.

# MRS.GELLER
628.336
We're sorry. We assumed...
629.711
629.879
...if you got married after you turned 30
you'd pay for it yourself.
632.839
633.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
633.007
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.
635.675
# MR.GELLER
635.843
Which means you had seven years
of beach fun...
638.178

We really do feel bad about this though.

# MR.GELLER

We started saving again
when you dated Richard.

But then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.
649.898

What about when I started
dating Chandler?

We might still have some
if your father hadn't thought...
668.083
668.250
...to sell ice over the Internet.

You guys are gonna have to get married
in, like, a rec center.
785.492

# CHANDLER
786.702
Honey, it's gonna be okay.
788.683
# MONICA
788.683
No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.
790.663
790.831
No swing band, no lilies.
792.770
# RACHEL
792.770
No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.
794.709
794.919
I mean, you don't need to have this...
797.712
797.922
...rustic Italian feast, you know?
800.799
801.200
**LOL**
801.050
And you don't need this custom-made
empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.
807.514
807.723
You can wear off-the-rack.
809.432
810.600
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
814.897
Look, it really is gonna be okay.
816.439
816.649
The important thing is that we love
each other and we're gonna get married.
820.819
# RACHEL
821.070
Do you even understand
what "off-the-rack" means?
824.739
825.300
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
826.659
Why don't you just pay for it yourself?
828.576
# MONICA
828.786
How? I don't have any money.
830.286
# CHANDLER
830.538
Well, I have some.
831.538
# MONICA
831.538
How much?
832.539
# CHANDLER
832.748
Well, close to....

847.221
# RACHEL
847.221
What? How much?
848.638
# MONICA
848.848
It's enough for wedding scenario A.
850.307
# RACHEL
850.307
Really?
851.766
852.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
851.934
How great are you, you little saver? Heh.
854.853
855.020
The amount you have is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.
857.939
# RACHEL
858.107
Oh, you guys
are so made for each other.
861.067
861.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
862.194
Well, you're not suggesting we spend
all of the money on the wedding?
865.446
865.614
MONICA & RACHEL :
Uh, yeah.
867.448
867.700
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
868.951
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...
872.662
872.872
...and I kind of have some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.
877.125
# PHOEBE
877.334
Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.
881.337
881.400
**LOL**
# MONICA
883.799
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.
887.302
# CHANDLER
887.469
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.
891.389
# MONICA
891.640
Honey, um, I love you. Heh.
894.058
894.226
But, um, if you call our wedding a party
one more time...
897.520
897.813
...you may not get invited.
899.355
900.000
**LOL**
902.109
We can always earn more money, okay?
But we're only gonna get married once.
906.112
# CHANDLER
906.322
Look, I understand, but I have to put
my foot down, okay? The answer is no.
910.742
# MONICA
911.994
You're gonna have
to put your foot down?
914.162
# CHANDLER
914.371
Yes, I am.
916.664
# PHOEBE
918.500
Wow. Money and a firm hand.
921.836
922.046
Finally a Chandler
I can get onboard with.
924.672

Joey.

**LOL**
# JOEY
937.436
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?
940.188
# RACHEL
940.356
Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.
944.651
945.100
**LOL**
# JOEY
945.361
No, no, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?
948.780
949.573
Something's on fire.
950.698
# RACHEL
951.033
No, I don't smell anything.
952.867
# JOEY
953.452
Oh, you know what?
It's probably just your burning loins.
956.788

**LOL**
# ROSS
961.543
Hey, what are you guys talking about?
963.044
# RACHEL

Nothing.
964.545
# ROSS
967.049
Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.
970.051
970.260
Hey, Rach, do you mind
if I heat this up on your loins?
972.470
973.700
**LOL**
# RACHEL
976.475
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey....
980.269
# ROSS
980.688
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up, huh?
983.898
# RACHEL
984.108
Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.
987.735
989.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
989.196
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
990.238
990.406
Well, uh, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.
994.701
995.744
'Sup?
996.953
997.600
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
998.414
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?
1002.417
1003.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
1004.962
Excuse me, ladies.
1006.754
1007.500
**LOL**
1007.756
I'm sorry?
1009.257
# PHOEBE
1009.466
My massage client, Arthur.
1011.843
1012.094
His daughter called and said
some guy that worked for me...
1014.762
1014.930
...gave him a really weird massage
this afternoon.
1017.098
# ROSS
1017.307
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.
1020.226
1020.700
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
1020.811
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.
1023.813
1024.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
1024.023
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.
1026.774
1027.026
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...
1030.111
1030.900
**LOL**
1030.320
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.
1034.532
1035.500
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
1036.785
Well, he's never coming back, okay?
You just cost me $80 a week.
1040.538
# ROSS
1040.789
You know what? This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.
1044.000
# PHOEBE
1044.293
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.
1047.253
1047.463
You could've sent him away.
1048.755
1048.922
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.
1051.674
1052.200
**LOL**
# ROSS
1053.343
He said he liked that.
1055.970
1056.200
**LOL**
1058.474
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.
1061.392
# JOEY
1061.769
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?
1064.979
1064.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
1067.149
His daughter was hot.
1068.337
# JOEY
1068.337
Gotcha.

Hey.
1078.993
# MONICA
1079.369
Listen, um...
1081.287
1082.706
...I've been thinking.
1084.165
1084.333
And it's not fair for me to ask you
to spend all your money on our wedding.
1089.337
1089.546
I mean, you work really hard for that.
1092.507
# CHANDLER
1092.841
Well.
1093.883
# MONICA
1093.883
Well, you work for that.
1094.926
1095.800
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1097.012
Look, I thought about it too.
1098.596
1098.764
And I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.
1104.352
# MONICA
1105.354
You do?
1107.272
# CHANDLER
1107.272
Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.
1109.190
1109.800
**LOL**
1111.026
Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...
1113.986
1114.154
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.
1117.365
1117.616
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...
1120.952
1121.203
...then that's what we're gonna do.
1123.329
# MONICA
1123.705
You are so sweet.
1126.124
1128.252
Oh, but wait.
1130.086
1130.587
What about our--?
What about the future and stuff?
1133.214
# CHANDLER
1133.382
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.
1135.716
1135.900
**LOL**
1135.968
So we only have two kids.
1137.343
1137.553
You know, we'll pick our favorite
and that one will get to go to college.
1141.389
1141.500
**LOL**
# MONICA
1142.391
Have you thought about that?
1143.725
# CHANDLER
1143.725
Yeah.
1145.059
# MONICA
1145.269
How many kids were we gonna have?
1146.936
# CHANDLER
1147.104
Uh, four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.
1150.857
1152.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
1152.609
What else did you think about?
1154.652
# CHANDLER
1154.820
Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.
1157.655
1157.906
Like a small place outside the city...
1160.575
1160.742
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes and stuff.
1163.995
1164.246
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...
1167.081
1167.374
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.
1171.878
1172.087
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.
1176.132
1176.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
1181.597
You know what?
1182.889
1184.099
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.
1186.767
# CHANDLER
1187.436
Sure you do.
1188.374
# MONICA
1188.374
No.
1189.312
1190.898
I want everything that you've just said.
I want a marriage.
1195.610
# CHANDLER
1196.778
You sure?
1197.946
# MONICA
1197.946
Mm-hm.
1199.113
# CHANDLER
1200.908
I love you so much.
1202.513
# MONICA
1202.513
I love you.
1204.118
1209.291
Hey, listen, when you were talking
about our future, you said cat.
1213.127
1213.420
But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.
1215.838
1215.900
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
1218.175
Ha, yeah, totally.

Yeah.
1245.743
1246.370
Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?
1247.870
1248.121
You keep making these stupid jokes
and these sleazy innuendoes...
1251.123
1251.333
...and it's just not funny anymore.
1253.209
# JOEY
1253.418
All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.
1256.712
1256.922
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.
1261.217
1261.900
**LOL**
# RACHEL
1261.385
Ugh.

You want to do it? Let's do it.

Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting.
Get those clothes off.

because you're in for a rough ride.
