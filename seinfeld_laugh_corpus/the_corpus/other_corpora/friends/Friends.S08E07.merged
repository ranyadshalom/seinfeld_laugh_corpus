Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!
10.259
10.427
You did the windows!
11.593
11.761
I have been begging for months
and you did, you cleaned!
14.388
14.556
And nagging works!

# MONICA

Oh, well, I hope by "maid,"
you mean "mistress"...
33.157

was cleaning

Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.
39.455

"Relinquish" is just
a fancy word for "lose."

# CHANDLER
42.751
Look, she's really nice, okay?
44.168

And she mentioned that she adored
the way that you arranged the sponges.
49.089
49.100
**LOL**
# MONICA
50.633
Did she really say that?
51.800
# CHANDLER

Yes, I distinctly remember
because I thought it was a joke.

**LOL**
# PHOEBE
160.577
Are you asking me out?
162.119

# RACHEL
229.229
I haven't discussed it,
but he's gonna be relieved.
231.772
231.940
Last week he brought this girl over...
233.815
233.983
...and I started talking to her
about morning sickness.
236.860
237.028
Then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.

But how great would that be, huh?
258.882

You living in my building?
260.509
260.677
I could take care of the baby,
I could come over whenever I want...

I have been looking for them all week
and she is wearing them.
405.862
# CHANDLER
406.030
So she stole your pants...
407.572
407.740
...and then she came back
and wore them in front of you?

Don't you see? It's the perfect crime.

I will prove it to you.
419.501
419.669
About a week ago,
I was wearing those jeans.
421.670
421.838
I dropped a pen in my lap
and it left an ink stain on the crotch.
424.840
425.007
When she comes back,
I will find it and show you that stain!
429.428
429.000
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
431.889
Is it possible the company
that sold the jeans...
434.516
434.684
...made more than just the one pair?
436.852
437.200
**LOL**
# MONICA
438.187
I guess.
439.187
# CHANDLER
439.355
So shouldn't we give her
the benefit of the doubt before we go...
442.482
442.650
...snooping around her crotch?
444.609
444.600

Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

I'm not angry at all anymore.

Look, I like you, but it shouldn't
be this hard. It's our first date.
569.442

First dates are supposed to be
about excitement and electricity.
573.572
573.739
And "Ooh, he touched my hand,
did he mean touch my hand?"
576.741
576.909

So, um, I was talking to Ross and he said
you were looking for a new place?

# RACHEL
750.416
Oh, yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.

But Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.

No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.
768.516
768.900
**LOL**
769.560
You could put it over here.
772.854
772.700

773.564
Or we could put it right here.
Aw! Cute, right?
776.858
777.600
**LOL**
777.026
Or over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.
788.578
788.746
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.
792.165
792.333
Imagine bringing home some girl...
794.375
794.543
...and trying to score
when there's a screaming baby.
797.295

It's so sweet that you want me

How come?
871.703
# MONICA
871.871
Because I put my head
between her legs.
874.706
874.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER

To see her pants?
876.542

Are you sure? Did you see the stain?

My pink flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!
902.275
# CHANDLER
902.443
And yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?
904.611

**LOL**
# MONICA
904.778
Here's the plan, okay?
906.404
906.572
I'm going to leave,
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.
909.574
# CHANDLER
909.742
Here's another plan. No.
912.619
912.700

913.704
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.
916.080
# CHANDLER
916.248
Why?
917.582
# MONICA
917.582

I fear a jury will see it the same way.

Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

You see that?
933.681
# MONICA
934.516
Do you see this? Unh....

**LOL**
# CHANDLER
938.687
All right. Yes, okay. I get your point.
941.189
941.357
But if it's not her bra,
will you just let the woman clean?
944.275
# MONICA
944.443
Yes. Absolutely. Okay?
946.110
946.278
You'll know it's mine because on
the right cup, the lacy part...
949.280
949.448
...there's very a noticeable rip.

and thought she was you

We can put screens here
so the baby has privacy...
1170.877
1171.044
...and maybe a mobile,
you know, over the crib...
1174.255
1174.423
...and, uh, here's a baby monitor which,
until the baby comes...

be with that woman.
