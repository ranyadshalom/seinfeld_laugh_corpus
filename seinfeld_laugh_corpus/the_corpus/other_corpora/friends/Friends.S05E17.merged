It's so unfair that
our date has to get cut short...

Yeah, it's weird.
I can't help it, though. He's so sweet.
304.261

He's like this little puppy dog, you know?
306.805
306.973
But like a really tough one
who shoots bad guys.

Ugh, it was horrible!
And the interview part went so well.
396.770
396.938
You know, like, I even made him laugh.
He said something about a boat...
400.399
400.566
...and I was like, "Well, yeah,
if you've got enough life jackets."
406.696
408.800
**LOL**
409.534
Trust me. lt was actually very funny.

All right, we were shaking hands...
419.543
418.700
**LOL**
419.710
...and he kind of leaned in toward me.
Maybe he was going to open the door.
423.255
423.423
But I totally misread him and I, uh....
427.634
428.200
**LOL**

such a mistake now, is it?
454.619
454.600
**LOL**

Wait a minute, wait. You don't think
that's why he wants me back?

in the interview...
467.215
467.383
...and now he wants me back of course...
469.217
469.385
...because, "Let's bring back
the girl who kisses everybody"!

**LOL**
# CHANDLER
475.099
Come on, Rach.

He wants you back
because you're right for the job.
482.397

Maybe. I don't know. Oh, God!
How could I be so stupid?

Okay, heh.

We have got to beat them!
730.166
# CHANDLER
730.166
Why?
731.563
# MONICA
731.731
Because Gary and Phoebe think
they're a hotter couple than we are.
735.358
735.526
Oh! So?
736.610
# CHANDLER
736.610
So?
737.694

So we've gotta go have a lot of sex
and prove them wrong!

# CHANDLER
742.742
You have got to stop this
competitive thing. It's crazy.
745.744
745.911
Just to impress Gary and Phoebe...
747.495
747.663
...you want me to go upstairs
and have sex over and over...
750.415
750.583
...and I'm saying no to this why?
Get your coat!

I don't know,

**LOL**
893.475
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
But you know what? It doesn't matter.
896.311
896.478
I'm never gonna meet her anyways.
897.416
# MONICA
897.416
Why?
898.354
# JOEY
898.522
Because it's impossible
to find her apartment!
900.648
900.816
She lives in some hot-girl
parallel universe or something.
904.527
903.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
905.446
What are you talking about?
907.030
907.197
She lives on the 2nd floor,
7th apartment from the left.
910.533
# JOEY
910.701
No, no, no, she lives on the 3rd floor,
8th apartment from the left.
914.662
# MONICA
914.830
No. Those first two windows,
that's the lobby.
918.082
918.292
That other window is the stairway.
You've been counting wrong.
921.753
# JOEY
922.004
I did not know that!
Thank you, Monica.
925.131

Uh, first, I would like to say thank you
for agreeing to see me again.
959.499
# MR.ZELNER
959.667
That's, uh, quite all right.
961.000
961.168
But I feel obligated to tell you
that this meeting is being videotaped.
965.505
965.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
969.093
Okay. Um.
970.718
970.886
Well, first, I would like to start
by apologizing for kissing you...
975.431
975.599
...and, uh, for yelling at you.
977.809
# MR.ZELNER
977.977
Fair enough.
979.686
# RACHEL
979.853
Now, you're probably going to hire
one of the people who, uh
983.564
983.732
Who did-- Who did not, um, ahem...
987.110
985.100
**LOL**
987.277
...yell at you and storm out.
989.654
989.905
And I think that's a big mistake.
And here's why.
992.657
992.908
I made a huge fool of myself,
and I came back. That shows courage.
997.370
997.997
When I thought you wanted sex
in exchange for this job, I said no.
1002.041
1002.251
That shows integrity.
1003.793
1004.400
**LOL**
1004.003
And I was not afraid
to stand up for myself...
1006.754
1007.006
...and that shows courage.
1009.215
1010.300
**LOL**
1010.759
Okay, ahem.
1011.801
1011.969
Now, I know that I've
already said courage...
1014.929
1015.180
...but you've got to have courage.
1017.557
1017.300
**LOL**
1018.308
And, um, finally...
1020.101
1020.269
...when I thought you were making
sexual advances in the workplace...
1023.563
1023.731
...I said no, and I was not litigious.
1026.065
# MR.ZELNER
1026.233
So there you go. You got courage...
1028.276
1028.444
...you got integrity,
you got courage again...
1032.113
1032.281
...and not litigious.
1035.033
1035.300

Oh, I knew that.
1044.375
1045.878
I really, really want this job.
1048.004
1048.213

I may regret this, but, uh...
1061.142
1062.019
...I'm gonna give you a shot.

Would it be inappropriate
if I gave you a hug?

I'm gonna leave. Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.

Now, I gotta go.
Officer Bing's got a 1 0-1 00.

# PHOEBE
1130.796
Oh, ha, ha. Um....
1133.089
1133.257
We kind of took a detour
on our way over here.
1136.217
# GARY
1136.385
We were strolling through the park
and no one was around, so....
1140.054
# MONICA
1140.222
You didn't.
1141.431
1141.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
1141.431
We did!
1142.640
1142.808
Ha, ha. We violated section 12,
paragraph 7 of the criminal code.
1147.520
1147.300
**LOL**
# MONICA
1150.691
The park, huh?
1151.712

Can you excuse me for a second?

# MONICA
1168.625
Hi, Chandler.
1170.209
# CHANDLER
1170.502
Monica, this is the men's room.
1172.712
1172.200
**LOL**
1173.922
Isn't it?
1175.423
1175.500
**LOL**
# MONICA
1177.593
Yes, it is.
1179.010
1179.178
But see, I've always found
the men's bathroom very sexual.
1182.763
1182.973
Haven't you?
1184.307
# CHANDLER
1184.307
No.
1185.641
1185.851
And if I did, I don't think
we'd be going out.
1188.769
1188.600
**LOL**
1189.479
This is getting ridiculous.
1191.439
# MONICA
1191.607
Come on, we can't let them win!
1192.920
# CHANDLER
1192.920
Uh
1194.233
1194.401
We've proved that we are hot, okay?
So why are you obsessed about this?
1198.946
# MONICA
1199.114
Phoebe and Gary are in that "can't keep
their hands off each other" phase!
1202.950
# CHANDLER
1204.328
So?
1204.953
1205.500
**LOL**
1204.953
So.
1205.578
# MONICA
1205.746
It makes me really sad that
we're not really there anymore.
1209.832
# CHANDLER
1210.125
Oh, is that what
this has all been about?
1212.877
# MONICA
1214.880
Wasn't it a lot more exciting
when we were, you know...
1217.673
1217.925
...all over each other all the time?
1220.176
# CHANDLER
1220.344
Yeah, that was great.
That was really great.
1223.804
1223.972
But to tell you the truth,
I'm more excited about where we are now.
1227.350
# MONICA
1227.809
Really?
1228.747
# CHANDLER
1228.747
Yeah.
1229.685
1229.853
I've never been in a relationship
that's lasted this long before.
1232.897
1233.065
To get past the beginning and
still want to be around each other?
1236.651
1236.818
I think that's pretty incredible.
1238.945
1239.112
And the fact that
this is happening with you...
1241.948
1242.366
...I think that's pretty exciting.
1244.492
# MONICA
1249.081
That's so sweet.
1251.123
1252.501
I know that I was acting
a little crazy...
1255.169
1256.213
...but I feel the same way.
1257.422
# CHANDLER
# MONICA
1257.422
Mm?
1258.631
# CHANDLER
1263.637
You know what I just realized?
1265.304
1265.514
You just freaked out
about our relationship.
1267.640
# MONICA
1267.808
Pfft, I did not.
1268.766
# CHANDLER
1268.766
Yes, you did!
1269.725
1269.893
Admit it. You freaked out!
1271.394
1271.600
**LOL**
# MONICA
1272.646
I freaked out a little.
1274.105
# CHANDLER
1274.314
A little?
You freaked out bigtime, okay?
1277.024
1277.300
**LOL**
1277.276
And I fixed it!
We have switched places.
1279.277
1279.486
I am the relationship king,
and you are the crazy, irrational screwup!
1284.031
