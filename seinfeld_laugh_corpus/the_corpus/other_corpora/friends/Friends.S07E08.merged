a secret this year?

# CHANDLER
10.552
No, we're playing this game
I learned at work.
12.344
12.554
You have to name all the states
in six minutes.
15.097
# ROSS
15.348
What? That's, like, insanely easy.
17.933
# CHANDLER
18.143
No, it's harder than it sounds.
You always forget at least one.
20.728
20.979
Or in some cases, 14.
24.106

# MONICA
25.358
It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing
against other people...

a group of well-educated adults...
169.585
169.836
...and Joey, can't name all the states.
174.464
171.600

Ross, if you don't know them by now,
you will never know them, okay?
209.208

That is the beauty of this game.
It makes you want to kill yourself.

This is crazy. I can do this.
215.964

I don't know.
Maybe because it smells weird.
