Hey, oh, how did it go?
8.924
# PHOEBE
9.134
Um, not so good.
10.175
10.385
He walked me to the subway and said,
"We should do this again."
13.178
13.800
**LOL**
# ALL
13.388
Ouch.
14.722
# RACHEL
14.722
What? He said, "We should do it again."
16.056
16.266
That's good, right?
17.307
18.000
**LOL**
# MONICA
17.517
Uh, no. Loosely translated,
"We should do this again,"
20.602
20.812
"You will never see me naked."
22.855
23.000
**LOL**
# RACHEL
24.065
Since when?
25.274
# JOEY
25.483
Since always. It's, like, dating language.
28.819
29.029
You know, like, "It's not you,"
means, "It is you."
32.239
33.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
33.616
"You're such a nice guy,"
34.992
35.201
"I'm gonna be dating
leather-wearing alcoholics...
37.161
37.370
...and complaining about them to you."
39.788
39.500
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
40.623
Or, you know, um, "I think we should see
other people,"
43.292

"Ha, ha, I already am."

47.880
# JOEY
48.089
Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.
50.049
# CHANDLER
50.258
Like when you're a kid
and your parents put your dog to sleep...
52.801
53.011
...and they tell you it went off
to live on some farm.
55.429
# ROSS
55.638
That's funny.
No, because, uh, our parents actually did...
58.682
58.892
...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.
61.393
# MONICA
61.603

Ha, ha. Hello.
The Milner's farm in Connecticut?
68.567
68.777
The Milners,
they had this unbelievable farm.
71.195
71.404
They had horses and rabbits
that he could chase.
73.947
74.157
And it was...
75.991
77.300

"So how does it feel
knowing you're about to die?"
138.095
# JOEY
138.304
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.
141.640
141.850
But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.
146.728
# CHANDLER
147.939
Hey, that was really good.
148.793
148.793

Thanks. Let's keep going.
151.191
# CHANDLER
151.401
Okay. "So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?"
156.238
# JOEY
158.783
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell, I can smoke.
162.661
# CHANDLER
162.871
"Smoke away."
164.621
172.505
Heh.
173.964
# CHANDLER
177.886
I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.
181.513
181.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
182.557
What?
183.474
# CHANDLER
183.474
Relax your hand.
184.391

Let your wrist go.
186.351

Not so much.

All right. Now try taking a puff.
192.107
192.567
Right.
193.984
# CHANDLER
195.862
Okay, no, give it to me.
197.550
# JOEY
197.550
No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.
199.239
# CHANDLER
199.449
No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want
to get this part or not? Here.
202.784
# CHANDLER
203.578
All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.
206.622
206.831
Think of it as the thing
that has been missing from your hand.
210.834
211.100
**LOL**
211.669
When you're holding it, you feel right.
213.962

You feel complete.

You miss it?

**LOL**
# MONICA
235.652
No, no, no.
236.693
236.903
They say it's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...
240.072
240.281
...to the tip of his index finger.
241.907
245.600

That's ridiculous.

263.221
Coffee, black.
264.972
266.099
Latte.
267.307
269.435
And an iced tea.
270.602

292.667
It's my bank.

# MONICA
294.210
What did they do to you?
295.460
# PHOEBE
295.670
It's nothing, it's just... Okay.
297.504
297.714
I'm going through my mail,

300.340

What are you talking about? Keep it.
315.127
# PHOEBE
315.127
It's not mine.
316.732
316.941
I didn't earn it.
If I kept it, it would be like stealing.
319.568
# RACHEL
319.777
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.
323.363
323.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
324.574
Okay. Okay.
325.699
325.908
Let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.
327.993
328.202
Do you know what I'd hear
with every step I took?
330.495
330.705
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."
333.123
333.900
**LOL**
333.333
And even if I was happy, okay,
and skipping...
336.168

We're with you. We got it.

Why should I let them meet him?
423.171
423.381
I bring a guy home and within five minutes
they're all over him.

Well, you do realize that the odds
of that happening are a little slimmer...
