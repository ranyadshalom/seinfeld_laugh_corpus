Hey.

# MONICA
# RACHEL
4.713
What's the matter?
6.255
# PHOEBE
6.423
Well, it's just-- It's one
of these situations that I just hate.
9.466
8.200
**LOL**
9.634
You know,
a massage client gave me three tickets...
12.386
12.554
...to the Helmut Peltz Exhibit
at the Morgan Chase Museum.
15.347
# JOEY
15.515
Now you're thinking
you gotta sleep with him.
17.850
17.700
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
18.727
No. No, it's just that he gave me
three tickets and there are six of us.
22.688
# CHANDLER
22.897
I'll give up my ticket.
24.106
# JOEY
24.106
Me too.
25.315
25.200
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
26.234
Okay. That's so generous.
27.484
# CHANDLER
27.652
And I think Ross is generous too.
30.571
30.400
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
31.281
Great. Okay. Then it's just us girls.
32.990
33.158
Great.
34.159
# PHOEBE
34.159
Yeah.
35.159
35.300
**LOL**
# RACHEL
36.119
So, what is the exhibit?
37.619
# PHOEBE
37.787
It's mostly just photographs...
40.497
40.665
...of, um, lesbian love scenes interspersed
with video games and free sandwiches.
45.544
47.700
**LOL**
# JOEY
49.424
Oh, man.
50.883

Hi.
55.575
# RACHEL
55.575
Hi. Hi there.
56.346
# CHANDLER
56.514
Hey, Ross, listen.
57.973
# JOEY
58.141
Chandler got you out of going to the
lesbian sandwich museum this weekend.
61.935
61.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
63.772
Thanks? But I have plans.
Uh, Elizabeth and I are going out of town.
68.609
# MONICA
68.777
Oh, that's great.
69.402
# ROSS
69.402
Yeah.
70.027
# MONICA
70.195
Think about all the money
that you're gonna make.
72.488
70.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
72.655
Why? What?
73.697
# MONICA
73.865
Well, her father pays you
for babysitting, right?
75.783
# ROSS
75.950
Uh-oh.
76.492
77.000
**LOL**
76.492
Ha, ha.
77.034
78.244
No, no. That's funny.
But maybe it's time to move on.
80.996
81.164
You know, let it go. Stop it.
82.831
83.400
**LOL**
83.917
Besides, Rachel's going out
with Elizabeth's father.
86.418
86.586
So, uh, he's much older than she is.
89.546
90.006
Looks like I'm not the only one
interested in fossils. Huh?
94.635
95.200
**LOL**
# RACHEL
95.678
Ross, all that does is remind us
that you are interested in fossils.
99.431
99.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
101.226
Okay, okay.
102.267
102.435
Uh, well, Rachel's gonna need to yell
sweet nothings in his ear. Huh?
107.940
109.500
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
111.945
Ross?
113.154
# ROSS
113.154
Oh, come on, that's funny, you know?
114.363
114.531
Because he's got, like, a hearing aid,
you know?
117.533
118.100
**LOL**
118.827
Because he's all old.
120.410
124.400
**LOL**
127.900
**LOL**
128.419
One second.
130.003
# PAUL
131.339
Okay, look, Ross.
133.715
134.551
Just so you know,
since Lizzie likes you so much...
136.969
137.137
...I accept the fact
that you're going out with her.
139.388
# ROSS
139.556
Really? Okay, that's great.
141.473
# PAUL
141.641
Yeah. But then I changed my mind.
144.393
144.561
I'm funny like that.
146.270
146.100
**LOL**
147.230
So I've told Lizzie
and now I'm telling you.
149.106
149.274
I don't want you seeing
my daughter anymore.
151.692
# ROSS
151.860
All right, look. I realize it upsets you.
154.236
# PAUL
154.404
Yes, it does.
155.654
156.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
157.782
But Elizabeth and I are both adults...
160.868
161.035
...and so I don't think there's really
anything you can do about it.
164.872
# PAUL
165.039
I'll tell the university about
your relationship and have you fired.
167.875
# ROSS
168.042
Oh, a man with a plan.
170.586
210.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
212.295
This is so exciting. You get your picture
back up on the wall of fame.
216.131
# JOEY
216.299
I know. It was so cool
when it was up there before.
218.800
218.968
Me and Jim Belushi would just be
cracking up about something.
222.596
222.400
**LOL**
222.764
Then I get fired off Days of Our Lives
and he takes me down.
226.058
226.226
Now he's just laughing at me.
228.310
228.800
**LOL**
229.062
Look at him. That smug Belushi bastard.
232.648
232.600
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
234.484
Oh. Okay. Maybe when they put
your picture back up...
237.194
237.362
...they could put you next to Matt Lauer.
239.529
239.697
Look at him just smiling at me. Hee-hee.
242.950
243.000
**LOL**
244.160
Yeah, I know. We'd be great together.
246.703
247.000
**LOL**
# JOEY
249.290

Who are you?
252.668
253.600
**LOL**
# JOEY
255.546
Joey Tribbiani.
257.339
257.507
From the wall?
259.174
259.342
Okay, maybe this
will jog your memory, huh?
262.010
262.500
**LOL**
263.680
Huh?
264.763
266.307
Okay, anyway.
267.516
267.684
I'm ready to go back up on the wall.
I'm the star of a new TV show.
271.603
# THEDRYCLEANER
272.563
Show me in the TV book.
274.168
# JOEY
274.168
Oh, well, it's not on TV yet.
275.774
274.900
**LOL**
# THEDRYCLEANER
275.942
Well, then it's not on the wall yet.
278.110
278.800
**LOL**
# JOEY
279.779
Okay, fine. I will bring you a tape. Huh?
283.865
# PHOEBE
284.534
So, um, now, do you have any
of Matt Lauer's clothes here?
287.411
287.578
Maybe just ones
that haven't been cleaned yet?
290.372
290.600

292.834
God.

Soaking up all the culture.
300.883
# RACHEL
300.883
Yeah.
301.967
# MONICA
302.135
Where do you want to start?
303.115
# RACHEL
303.115
Ooh, the gift shop.
304.094
# MONICA
304.262
Yeah.

Hey, and then lunch.
307.472
# RACHEL
307.472
Oh, wait, yes, but I can't eat too much.
309.057
309.225
Paul's taking me out to dinner tonight.
He said he has a big surprise planned.
312.602
# PHOEBE
312.770
Ow, wow. What do you think?
Maybe he's gonna tell you he's gay?
317.024
316.900
**LOL**
# RACHEL
318.276
What? No, why?
319.651
# PHOEBE
319.819
No reason. That would just be
a really big surprise, right?
323.238
323.100
**LOL**
324.365
You could put the aisle over here
and then have the wedding ceremony here.
327.701
# RACHEL
328.077
I didn't know
you could get married here.
330.120
# MONICA
330.288
This would be a beautiful place
to get married.
332.456
332.623
Yeah, but I wouldn't put the aisle there.
And I'd never have the ceremony there.
336.084
336.252
You'd have the ceremony
under this big, beautiful arch.
338.712
338.880
May I help you?
340.464
340.300
**LOL**
# RACHEL
341.132
Oh, sorry. Didn't mean to interrupt.
It's a beautiful space.
344.051
344.218
Do you do a lot of weddings here?
345.385
345.385
Yes, we're very popular.
346.553
346.721
There's a two-year waiting list. Sorry.
349.348
349.600
**LOL**
# RACHEL
350.641
Monica, you should totally put
your name down for this place.
353.018
# MONICA
353.186
What? Are you crazy?
355.437
355.605
I'm not getting married.
I'm not even engaged.
358.357
# PHOEBE
358.524
Yeah, but there's a two-year wait.
What if you get engaged in two years?
362.027
362.195
Then you've gotta wait
another two years for this place?
364.404
364.572
That's four years.
Chandler's not gonna wait that long.
367.074
367.241
He's gonna find somebody else,
you know?
369.076
369.243
Someone who put their name on the list.
370.577
370.577
Mm-hm.
371.912
371.400
**LOL**
# RACHEL
372.997
Yeah. Honey, it can't hurt
to put your name down.
375.248
375.416
If in two years you're not engaged,
you just don't use it.
378.919
# MONICA
379.379
Well, I guess there is no harm
in putting my name down.
382.214
# RACHEL
382.382
I'm gonna do it too.
384.029
# PHOEBE
384.029
Me too.

# RACHEL
390.056
Oh, Pheebs.
391.348
# PHOEBE
391.724
Don't feel too sorry for me.
At least my boyfriend isn't gay.
394.851
396.700
**LOL**
# MONICA
397.271
Phoebe, that's not--
398.981
# PHOEBE

Don't even get me started on yours.

**LOL**
# JOEY
412.286
What? But you saw the show.
414.329
# THEDRYCLEANER
414.329
Yes. lt was very offensive to my people.
416.373
# JOEY
418.835
Dry cleaners?
420.210
420.400
**LOL**
# THEDRYCLEANER
422.630
Russians. lt showed them
as terrorists and villains.
425.841
# JOEY
426.008
Okay, okay.
Look, you got Harrison Ford up there.
429.386
# THEDRYCLEANER
429.554
That's right.
Mr. Ford is a very good customer.
431.930
432.098
He brings us a lot of clothes.
You bring us nothing.
434.391
# JOEY
434.559
Okay, well, that may be true.
435.934
436.102
But in Air Force One, okay,
the Russians were terrorists and evil.
440.564
436.900
**LOL**
440.731
And plus, he kills a bunch of them.
That's offensive to Russians.
444.151
# THEDRYCLEANER
444.318
I've never seen it.

460.001
Wow. The only thing I got
from my grandmother was her eyes. Heh.
463.545
463.713
I mean, not her actual eyeballs.
466.423
467.000

Well, so we have to hide our relationship
from one more person.
