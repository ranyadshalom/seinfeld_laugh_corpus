Before you start handing out rings

Wow, you seem to be doing much better.
664.746
664.914
That's great. How are things going?
666.561
# PHOEBE
666.561
Good.
668.208
668.376
No, but-- Okay, it feels like everything's
been about me lately.
671.711
671.879
So, what's happening with you?
673.463
# RACHEL
673.631
Oh. Well, actually, we were just talking
about me not going to Ross' wedding.
678.259
# PHOEBE
678.427
Oh.
679.198
# RACHEL
679.198
It just might be too hard...
679.969
680.137
...given the history and all that.
682.555
# PHOEBE
682.723
Wow, this reminds me of the time
when I was, um, living on the street.
686.893
687.061
And this guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.
690.897
692.500
**LOL**
# RACHEL
693.776
Well, how is this like that?
695.777
# PHOEBE
695.986
Well, let's see. It's not really like that.
700.031
699.000
**LOL**
700.199
Because, you see,
that was an actual problem.
702.826
702.993
And, uh, yours is just, like, a bunch
of high-school crap...
706.454
706.622
...that nobody really gives-- Yeah.
709.332
708.700
**LOL**
# RACHEL
714.630
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought
716.673
# PHOEBE
716.841
All right, here come the waterworks.
719.008
719.400
**LOL**
# JOEY
721.011
Oh. I don't know what I'm gonna do.
722.512
722.680
I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.
725.181
725.349
And I called 91 1 and they yelled at me.
727.434
727.601
If this isn't an emergency, then what is?
729.519
729.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
731.564
Hey, guys.
732.689
# CHANDLER
# JOEY
732.689
Hey.
733.815
733.900
**LOL**
# ROSS
735.151
I just wanted to thank you for last night.
What a great party.
737.902
738.070
And the guys from work had a blast.
739.821
739.989
You know, one of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.
743.074
743.242
Yeah, and another one had never been
to a party before, so....
747.287
747.500
**LOL**
# JOEY
749.039
So, uh, hey, that wedding ring, huh?
751.458
753.100
**LOL**
753.043
Man, that is nice.
754.127
# ROSS
754.127
Yeah. Yeah, right?
755.211
# JOEY
755.379
Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one
of those babies up for myself.
758.882
759.049
Where might one get one of those?
761.760
762.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
762.303
That ring, when my grandmother
first came to this country...
766.097
766.265
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.
770.560
772.400
**LOL**
# CHANDLER
773.147
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.
777.108
778.000
**LOL**
# ROSS
778.027
Oh, absolutely.
It's been in my family for generations.
781.196
781.363
And every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.
785.366
# CHANDLER
785.534
So you might say it's a magic ring.
789.245
789.000
**LOL**
# JOEY
793.584
Yeah, the stripper stole it.
796.377
795.800
**LOL**
# ROSS
797.922
My ring? My wedding ring?
799.964
800.132
The stripper stole my wedding ring?
803.843
804.011
How? How could this happen?
806.262
# CHANDLER
806.430
Well, I think it all started when you said,
"Hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man."
810.642
810.600
**LOL**
# ROSS
813.020
All right, all right. Fine.
I'm gonna call the cops.
815.730
# JOEY
815.981
Dude, I screwed up.
You don't have to turn me in.
819.317
818.700
**LOL**
# ROSS
819.485
Not on you, on the stripper.
821.486
# JOEY
821.486
Oh, yeah, well, I already did that.
823.488
823.656
They said they're gonna look into it
right after they solve all the murders....
827.075
827.500
**LOL**
# ROSS
827.952
Okay, we'll call the company
that sent her.
830.203
# JOEY
830.371
I did that too.
831.538
831.705
They wouldn't give me
her name or number.
833.623
833.791
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.
836.042
836.210
I said, "You talk to the police,
you tell them I'm missing a ring."
839.254
839.300
**LOL**
# ROSS
840.339
So, what, Joey? What are you telling me?
That there's nothing we can do?
843.675
843.843
How could this happen?
846.490
# JOEY
846.490
Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry.
849.138
# CHANDLER
851.809
Well, what if we just, uh, called her...
855.353
855.521
...used a fake name
and had her come to my office?
858.523
# JOEY
858.691
Oh, that sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!
862.360
863.900

898.250
# MONICA
898.250
Well, you can't have the baby here!

I haven't sterilized the apartment

# RACHEL
903.068
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.
904.527

You know what? It's okay. I'm gonna boil
some water and just rip up some sheets.
908.948
910.100
**LOL**
# PHOEBE
909.575
Ow, it's all right.
It's probably false labor.
912.243
912.411
They said that, that can happen
near the end. So just
914.746
914.914
Somebody get the book.
915.810
# MONICA

Uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.
932.597
932.765
And when she comes in, hopefully
she won't recognize you because
936.267
936.435
Well, why would she?
938.061
938.300
**LOL**
938.479
Uh, okay. And then you buzz Ross and I.

If she didn't take it...
1012.802

Then who did?

1060.309
...then you get to do the mom thing.
1062.685

it's like

1086.835
It's like I know them, you know, and....

I mean, you're not gonna be the one
worrying about saving for college.
1112.026
1112.194
Or yelling at them when they're bad.
1114.779
1114.947
You know?
Or deciding to put them on Ritalin...
1116.823
1116.990
...when they just won't calm down.
