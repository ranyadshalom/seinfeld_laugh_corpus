293.501
You're probably gonna catch her
just as she's about to go to the gate.
296.378
296.546
You're gonna call out her name
and yell, "I love you."
299.548

She's gonna say, "I love you too."
301.967

She said, "Thank you."
707.622

I said, "I love you."

And she said, "Thank you."

# CHANDLER
734.650
All right, look, forget it.
735.984
736.152
Okay, forget it.
You told her you love her. It's over.

It is not over. You're over.

753.836
Good one.
755.336
754.900
**LOL**
# MONICA
756.547
It's not over because she's gonna call you
and tell you she loves you.
760.175
760.342
The reason why she couldn't is because her
feelings were so strong that it scared her.
763.803
763.971
Now, you go home
and you wait for her call.
766.055
766.223
She could be calling you from the plane.
Come on, go.
768.683
# ROSS
768.851
Okay, okay. But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over.
773.104
773.439
No, wait, wait. Unless, eventually, I call her,
you know, to see what's going on...
777.984
778.152
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.
782.530

She doesn't know

This isn't how it was supposed to go.

Of course there's another guy.

If I hadn't let you talk me
into going to the airport in the first place...

951.366
# JOEY
951.533
Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.
953.368
953.535
Because you already told her you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.
956.579
956.747
Then she called you and told you
there was another guy.
959.123

So yeah. Go to London.
That will scare her.

You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight at all. Am I right?

...but they also need massages to relax?
1046.919
1047.087
So I just figured we could combine the two.
Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.
1051.716

I can fix up the van, bolt the table
in the back and you know what I've got?
