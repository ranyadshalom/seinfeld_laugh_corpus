If there is a serial killer loose in your
neighbourhood, it seems the safest thing...
3.717
3.718
is to be the neighbor.
4.787
4.806
They never kill the neighbor.
The neighbor survives to do...
7.875
8.400
**LOL**
7.942
the interview afterwards, right?
"He was kind of quiet."
10.875
10.945
These neighbors,
they're never disturbed...
13.275
13.381
by the sounds of murdering.
Just stereo.
15.881
16.500
**LOL**
15.984
Chain saws, people screaming, fine.
17.881
17.952
Just keep the music down.
20.384
20.655
And women who fall in love
with the killer.
22.950
21.400
**LOL**
23.024
They write to him in prison. Here's
a woman that's hard to disappoint.
26.924
27.300
**LOL**
27.095
She's only upset
when she finds out...
28.958
29.030
he's stopped killing people.
And she goes:
31.291
30.900
**LOL**
31.399
"You know, sometimes I feel like I don't
even know who you are anymore."
35.094
34.500
**LOL**
41.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
41.275
No. Eight years
isn't such a long streak.
43.707
# ELAINE
43.778
It isn't?
45.460
# JERRY
45.460
No. I haven't vomited in 13 years.
47.143
47.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
48.416
Get out.
50.496
# JERRY
50.496
Not since June 29th, 1980.
52.577
# ELAINE
52.687
You remember the date?
54.550
# JERRY
54.656
Yes. Because my previous vomit
was also June 29th, 1972.
60.626
57.300
**LOL**
60.695
That's why during the '80 vomit
I was yelling to George:
64.322
63.500
**LOL**
64.432
"Can you believe it?
I'm vomiting on June 29th again."
68.901
68.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
69.237
When Joel told me he hadn't
thrown up in eight years...
72.101
72.173
I was wondering if he was normal.
73.736
# JERRY
73.736
No, Elaine, he's normal.
75.299
75.443
Your boyfriend is normal.
He just has the same name...
78.137
78.212
as one of the worst serial killers
in history.
80.644
81.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
82.316
Oh, Jer, I gotta go. I gotta go.
84.646
# JOANNE
84.719
Hi.
85.582
85.582
Hey.
86.446
86.521
We just saw your boyfriend
at a bus stop.
88.589
# ELAINE
88.690
Oh, yeah?
89.889
# JOANNE
89.889
Yeah. What's his name?
91.088
# ELAINE
91.192
Joel.
92.174
# JOANNE
92.174
Joel what?
93.157
# ELAINE
93.361
Rifkin.
94.792
# MICHAEL
95.096
Rifkin? Joel Rifkin?
97.126
95.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
97.126
Yeah. It's just a coincidence...
99.155
99.233
obviously.
100.198
# MICHAEL
100.198
Guess you better...
101.164
101.235
keep on his good side.
102.996
103.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
103.838
Very funny. That's very funny.
105.803
# JOANNE
105.873
Yeah, I wouldn't sleep
with my back to him if I were you.
109.101
109.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
109.210
Yeah. Well, that's
enough of that. Enough.
111.437
# MICHAEL
111.546
If you smell anything
decaying in his car's trunk...
114.308
114.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
114.415
Look, this is my boyfriend
we're talking about.
116.779
116.884
He's a gentleman. He's good-looking,
he's a good shaver.
119.680
119.754
And he hasn't thrown up in eight years,
so just shut up about him. Shut up!
123.620
123.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
126.728
The whole city is talking
about this monster, Joel Rifkin.
129.558
129.630
And I am dating a Joel Rifkin.
131.561
# JERRY
131.632
But you like your Joel Rifkin.
134.133
133.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
134.133
Yeah. I wish he had a different name.
136.635
# JERRY
136.738
Ask him to change it.
138.465
138.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
138.539
You can't ask a person
to change their name.
141.301
# JERRY
141.375
Why not?
142.591
# ELAINE
142.591
Would you change yours?
143.807
# JERRY
143.911
If someone asked me nicely.
146.036
145.800
**LOL**
146.781
I'm Claude Seinfeld.
148.212
149.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
149.817
Hey, how many people
did Rifkin strangle, 18?
152.317
# JERRY
152.386
Yeah, 18 strangles.
153.851
# KRAMER
153.921
You know why Rifkin
was a serial killer?
156.148
156.224
Because he was adopted.
158.349
158.900
**LOL**
160.394
Just like Son of Sam was adopted.
162.485
162.597
So apparently, adoption leads
to serial killing.
165.564
168.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
169.470
Joel and I have an extra ticket
to the Giants game.
172.004
# KRAMER
172.073
I'll go.
172.868
# ELAINE
172.868
Okay.
173.663
173.500
**LOL**
175.109
I'll leave a ticket for you at will call.
177.024
# KRAMER
177.024
Yeah!
178.940
178.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
181.249
Should I have asked George?
182.839
# JERRY
182.950
Hey, did you hear George
got back with Karen?
185.348
# ELAINE
185.419
Karen?
186.385
# JERRY
186.385
Risotto.
187.350
# ELAINE
187.588
I feel full after the risotto.
189.553
189.900
**LOL**
189.690
Oh, the risotto broad.
191.555
# JERRY
191.555
Yeah.
193.419
193.594
He's got a good thing with her.
I'm doubling with them tonight.
196.686
# ELAINE
197.131
You don't like double dates.
198.194
# JERRY
198.194
George does.
199.256
199.333
He feels it's a good
personality showcase.
201.731
202.400
**LOL**
201.803
He likes a date to see him
with a friend...
203.894
203.971
so she gets a window
into his non-date personality.
206.596
207.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
206.941
I've looked through that window and
screamed at him to shut the blinds.
210.533
210.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
212.680
He feels he's funnier, more relaxed.
214.577
# ELAINE
214.649
And you're taking..?
216.098
# JERRY
216.098
Jodi, the masseuse.
217.547
# ELAINE
217.652
Hey, did you get a massage yet?
218.782
# JERRY
218.782
No.
219.913
219.987
How many times do I have to go out
with her before I get a massage?
223.318
222.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
223.591
Jerry, she gives massages all day. She
doesn't want to give them on dates.
227.218
# JERRY
227.328
Yeah, I know. She just wants
to have sex.
230.761
229.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
230.865
So what?
232.330
# JERRY
232.400
It's like going to Idaho
and eating carrots.
235.060
235.100
**LOL**
235.303
I like carrots, but I'm in Idaho,
I want a potato.
239.134
238.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
241.976
So I go into this clothing store,
and the saleswoman is wearing this...
246.069
245.800
**LOL**
246.180
low-cut thing.
247.770
247.849
So I said to her,
"Can I ask you a question?
250.110
250.184
When you put on a top like that,
what's your thought process?
253.981
254.700
**LOL**
254.121
What's going on in your mind?"
256.348
# KAREN
256.490
That is so funny.
258.285
# GEORGE
260.328
You listening to this?
261.993
261.100
**LOL**
# JODI
261.993
Yeah, I heard you.
263.659
# JERRY
263.831
Boy, my neck is killing me.
266.422
267.100
**LOL**
266.834
It's right in this spot.
Very tender over here.
269.334
# JODI
269.403
So, what did she say?
271.300
# GEORGE
271.405
Well, nothing.
I didn't actually say that.
274.668
272.600
**LOL**
# JODI
276.010
You just said you said it.
277.441
# GEORGE
277.511
Sweetheart, I was exaggerating.
280.239
# KAREN
280.348
I'm learning a lot
about you tonight, George.
283.110
281.500
**LOL**
283.184
I've never seen you like this.
284.979
# JERRY
286.654
It's like somebody's
pulling on wires back here.
289.780
289.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
290.258
It's like, you never see
a really attractive woman...
293.020
293.094
getting a traffic ticket.
294.855
# JODI
294.929
How can you say that?
My sister got a ticket last week.
298.521
298.599
Are you saying she's not attractive?
301.463
# GEORGE
301.802
Obviously, these are not
hard-and-fast rules.
304.700
304.805
Darling, the tea is getting
a little cold, sweetheart.
307.465

317.418
Yeah.
319.383

**LOL**
# JERRY
322.957
I strained my neck last night.
324.986
# JODI
324.986
Really, how?
327.016
# JERRY
327.094
I tried brushing my teeth
by holding the brush...
329.719
329.797
and moving my head
from side to side.
332.525
332.300
**LOL**
333.100
It didn't work.
334.690
# JODI
334.969
So, what's the deal
with your friend George?
337.765
# JERRY
337.838
No deal. Why?
339.371
# JODI
339.440
What was all that "attractive women
not getting tickets" nonsense?
342.805
# JERRY
342.910
Well, he was just showcasing
his non-date personality.
346.343
# JODI
347.315
How can you hang out with him?
349.042
# JERRY
349.116
Yeah, sometimes
it really makes me tense.
352.674
353.000
**LOL**
# JODI
353.854
Did you see
the way that he was eating?
356.013
# JERRY
356.090
Yeah, he's disgusting.
358.181
358.100
**LOL**
# JODI
359.126
I have to tell you,
I really don't like him.
361.626
# JERRY
361.729
Yeah, me either.
363.264
# JODI
363.264
It's just I hate that type.
364.798
# JERRY
364.865
He's a bad seed.
366.865
367.100
**LOL**
# JODI
368.803
Now, you, however, you, I like.
372.202

So, what do you think?
381.615
# KAREN

Really enjoyed it.

She's very nice.
385.415
385.987
Let's discuss this later.
388.351

388.456
You think she liked me?
She seemed to like me.
391.047
390.200
**LOL**
# KAREN
# GEORGE
391.826
I was personable, don't you think?
394.408
# KAREN
394.408
You were extremely personable.
396.989
# GEORGE
397.131
Because I thought I picked up
a little something.
400.098
400.500
**LOL**
400.167
I'm very good at this.
Did you pick up anything?
402.929
# KAREN
403.037
I didn't pick up anything.
405.402
# GEORGE
405.402
The second time I sent noodles back...
407.767
408.000
**LOL**
408.676
I thought she made a face.
410.573
# KAREN
410.811
I didn't see a face.
412.469
# GEORGE
413.681
I thought I saw a face.
415.442
415.600
**LOL**
# KAREN
415.516
What is the difference?
417.000
# GEORGE
417.000
No difference. I could care less.
418.483
418.552
She's Jerry's girlfriend.
420.570
# KAREN
420.570
George, instead of talking about this...
422.588
422.690
we could be... You know.
424.883
# GEORGE
# KAREN
# GEORGE
426.927
So you think she liked me?

438.320
Massaging your neck.

Boning up on football?

448.549
Yeah. Yeah. You know what?
451.117
451.185
There are a lot of players
named Deion these days.
455.016
454.700
**LOL**
455.423
What a cool name, Deion.
458.014
458.092
If I were gonna change my name,
I'd go with Deion.
460.717
# JOEL
461.629
Deion Benes?
463.697
# ELAINE
463.831
Well, as a woman,
it makes no sense.
465.626
466.500
**LOL**
467.101
But I mean...
Well, let's say I was you.
469.635
469.703
And I decided I was gonna
change my name...
472.033
472.106
For no real reason whatsoever.
474.572
474.775
Deion Rifkin.
477.366
479.113
That is so cool.
482.239
481.400
**LOL**
# JOEL
483.551
Deion Rifkin?
485.084
# ELAINE
485.786
Well, maybe you're not
the Deion type.
487.751
487.855
Okay, then let's see, let's see,
what do we got? Oh, oh, oh, O.J.
492.517
492.593
O.J. Rifkin. Oh, you don't even use
a name. It's just initials.
496.459
494.900
**LOL**
496.564
Oh, please, please, change your name
to O.J. It would be so great.
499.827

# JOEL
499.934
Elaine, what is going on?
502.366

# JERRY
507.407
Yeah.
509.175
508.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
509.510
Sex wasn't so good?
511.591

No. Sex was fabulous.

513.000
**LOL**

So?
516.232
# JERRY
516.232
I want the massage.
518.216
517.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
519.386
Did you ask her?
520.386
# JERRY
520.386
I put her hands there.
521.386
521.455
She just pulls it away immediately.
She's not into it.
524.285
# GEORGE
524.425
Why not?
525.737
# JERRY
525.737
I guess because it's her job.
527.050
527.128
It's very frustrating.
529.788
529.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
530.664
So we had a good time,
the four of us.
533.892

533.968
Yeah.
534.832

534.832
We all got along.

What did Jodi say?
539.784

539.784
She had a good time.
541.097

541.208
Is that it?
542.208

542.208
Pretty much.

547.544
# JERRY
547.648
What?
548.847
# GEORGE
548.847
No, no. It's all right. Great.
550.046
550.117
She had a good time.
551.582
# JERRY
552.553
Yeah.
554.780
554.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
554.922
You hesitated.
556.104
# JERRY
556.104
I was blowing on the coffee.
557.286
558.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
557.424
She didn't like me.
559.253
# JERRY
560.461
It's not like you'll be spending
a lot of time with her.
563.257
# GEORGE
563.364
So she doesn't like me?
564.829
# JERRY
564.965
No.
567.056
567.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
569.236
She said that?
570.253
# JERRY
570.253
Yes.
571.270
# GEORGE
572.173
She told you she doesn't like me?
573.389
# JERRY
573.389
Yes.
574.605
# GEORGE
574.875
What were her exact..?
576.159
# JERRY
576.159
"I don't like him."
577.443
577.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
582.850
Why didn't she like me?
584.315
# JERRY
584.451
Not everybody likes everybody.
585.633
# GEORGE
585.633
I wasn't nice?
586.815
# JERRY
586.954
You were very nice.
588.653
# GEORGE
588.653
I bent over backwards for that woman!
590.353
590.100
**LOL**
590.457
Was it what I said about her sister?
592.207
# JERRY
592.207
It has nothing to do with her.
593.958
594.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
594.061
I don't even know her sister!
But if she's getting tickets...
597.096
597.164
she's not that good-looking!
599.494
599.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
601.602
You vomited in 1987.
603.363
# JERRY
603.470
Oh, no. That was the dry heaves.
605.435
605.800

# JERRY

What are you doing here?
611.941
611.000
**LOL**
# JODI
612.046
I was giving Kramer a massage.
613.842
# JERRY
613.842
Kramer.
615.638
616.200
**LOL**
# JODI
617.084
Gotta run, I have an appointment.
618.708
# GEORGE
618.786
Let me take your table.
619.735
# JODI
619.735
That's okay.
620.683
# GEORGE
620.754
Please. I love to help people.
622.321
622.389
This is what I do.
Come on, I'm going this way.
626.050
624.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
626.126
I'll see you tonight.
627.853
629.300
**LOL**
# KRAMER
630.598
Hey! I am looser than creamed corn.
633.826
634.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
633.901
Who told you to get a massage?
I haven't gotten one from her!
636.993
# KRAMER
637.071
Oh, you don't know
what you're missing, buddy.
640.629
639.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
640.741
No one hails a cab like me.
642.809
642.876
My hailing technique is unmatched.
644.876
644.945
See, I get the wrist going
side to side and:
647.138
647.214
Cabs are crashing into themselves
to just pick me up.
650.147
648.500
**LOL**
650.217
All right, here we go.
Let me get the door.
653.411
653.520
Feminists aside,
I know women like the door-holding.
656.248
656.323
Here we are. Alrighty. Good. Okay.
659.984
660.060
Let's get together again soon.
661.718
661.795
Say hello to your sister.
662.942
# JODI
662.942
You've never met.
664.090
# GEORGE
664.164
Whatever. If I wasn't involved right
now, I wouldn't mind being set up.
668.360
665.800
**LOL**
668.435
Something tells me
she's a knockout!
671.698
671.000
**LOL**
# KRAMER
671.805
But first, she sets
the mood perfectly...
673.896
674.041
with this New Age music
played over ocean sounds.
678.100
678.178
Then she lays you out on this table.
680.439
680.914
And she proceeds to rub oil
over your entire body.
686.577
686.600
**LOL**
686.687
And she rubs long and deep.
690.689
690.758
Jerry, she rubs with love.
693.383
694.000
**LOL**
695.129
Every muscle she touches
just oozes...
700.189
700.200
**LOL**
700.668
beneath those silky, soft fingers.
703.066
703.671
You can scarcely
contain yourself, buddy.
706.069
# JERRY
706.140
So you had a good time, huh?
707.202
# KRAMER
707.202
Oh, yeah.
708.265
# JERRY
708.342
Enjoyed yourself?
709.541
# KRAMER
709.541
Very much.
710.740
# JERRY
710.811
All right, now, you listen,
and you listen good!
714.074
712.800
**LOL**
# KRAMER
714.381
What?
715.164
# JERRY
715.164
The massages are out!
715.948
# KRAMER
716.016
What..?
717.147
# JERRY
717.147
They're out!
718.277
718.900
**LOL**
# KRAMER
718.352
Why?
719.870
# JERRY
719.870
If I can't get one, you're not!
721.387
# KRAMER
721.488
Wait a minute. I need my massages.
Can't you see I'm burned out?
725.684
726.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
729.396
I'm sorry, Kramer.
731.830
# KRAMER
731.830
Why, why? Look, I paid for her!
734.263
734.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
735.469
Don't you ever
talk about her like that!
737.833
# KRAMER
737.905
Yeah, but why?!

Final!

Oh, you have photos in your wallet?
749.214
# JOEL
749.214
Yeah.
750.447
750.517
Why, is that weird?
752.018
# ELAINE
752.018
No, it's normal.
753.518
753.654
You're very normal.
You're totally normal.
758.157
755.500
**LOL**
759.860
Who's this?
761.509
# JOEL
761.509
That's my mother.
763.157
# ELAINE
763.364
Oh, yeah. I see the resemblance.
765.523
# JOEL
765.632
No, there's no resemblance.
767.132
# ELAINE
767.132
Yeah, there is. Right here...
768.633
# JOEL
768.702
Elaine, I was adopted.
771.032

# ELAINE
771.772
Oh, that's nice.
774.841
774.700
**LOL**
# JOEL
774.942
Oh, the game's about to start.
I wonder where your friend Kramer is.
779.138
780.100
**LOL**
# KRAMER
783.550
Yeah, a ticket for Kramer?
786.380
# TICKETMAN
786.854
Here it is. I need some ID.
788.668
# KRAMER
788.668
Oh, yeah.
790.481
794.728
You know, I forgot my wallet.
796.507
# TICKETMAN
796.507
Well, I can't give it to you then.
798.286
# KRAMER
798.565
Are you kidding me?
799.929
# TICKETMAN
799.929
I'm afraid not.
801.293
# KRAMER
801.402
Come on, just look at me.
Now tell me I'm not Kramer.
805.871
805.900
**LOL**
# TICKETMAN
807.207
I'm sorry. I need proof.
808.787
# KRAMER
808.787
Look, I'll drive out here tomorrow...
810.367
810.600
**LOL**
810.444
and I'll show you the ID.
812.011
812.079
I got nothing to do all day.
814.079
# TICKETMAN
814.214
Neither do I.
816.714
816.000
**LOL**
816.784
But without ID...
818.749
818.819
I need confirmation
from the person who left the ticket.
821.979
# KRAMER
822.089
Where's a phone?
824.419
# ANNOUNCER
825.726
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.
830.354
830.731
Would Joel Rifkin
report to the stadium office.
835.268
834.900
**LOL**
835.335
Joel Rifkin, telephone.
838.666
838.400
**LOL**
# JOEL
838.839
Who would be calling me here?
841.806
# ELAINE
842.810
He's not the murderer.

What's the matter with you?
858.354
# KRAMER
858.354
Jerry, I need another massage.
859.951
# JERRY
860.093
You just had one.
What do you need another one for?
862.559
# KRAMER
862.663
Because of the Giant game.
I told you, it went overtime.
865.425
865.499
You know those seats.
They're very unforgiving.
868.090
# JERRY
868.235
Oh, please.
869.684
# KRAMER
869.684
And then the game-winning field goal...
871.133
871.238
went over the net and into the crowd,
and I dove over three rows.
876.435
876.700
**LOL**
876.543
My back, it's killing me.
878.873
879.313
It's killing me, Jerry!
881.745
880.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
881.949
Well, did you get the ball?
883.779
# KRAMER
883.779
Oh, I got the ball.
885.610
885.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
885.686
I never caught a foul ball
at a baseball game.
887.981
# KRAMER
888.121
Well, it's quite a thrill.
890.746
890.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
890.824
Well, get somebody else.
892.387
# KRAMER
892.387
Nobody does it like she does.
893.950
894.027
She's the best.
895.158
# JERRY
895.158
Tonight's the night.
896.288
896.363
I'm getting one. No ifs, ands or buts.
898.897
# KRAMER
898.999
Well, what about my massage?
901.131
# JERRY
901.131
Ask Newman.
903.263
902.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
906.473
So I lugged that table,
that big, heavy massage table...
909.440
909.510
all the way down to the cab!
911.373
911.879
You ever see one of those things?
913.425
# KAREN
913.425
Of course.
914.971
# GEORGE
915.415
Well, I don't know.
Maybe you haven't.
917.483
917.551
You know. Not everybody's seen
a massage table.
919.949
918.600
**LOL**
# KAREN
920.053
You think I've never
had a massage?
921.814
922.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
921.922
Anyway, I don't even get a thank you.
I don't get it.
925.458
# KAREN
925.559
George, frankly, I'm getting
a little tired of hearing about her.
928.822
# GEORGE
928.929
I wanna know what I did
to this woman.
931.156
930.000
**LOL**
# KAREN
931.331
You got a little thing for her?
933.160
# GEORGE
933.300
No, no. She's going out
with a friend of mine.
936.699
936.803
It's only courteous
to try and like each other.
939.337
# KAREN
939.439
What's the difference?
Who cares if she doesn't like you.
942.269
942.342
Does everybody in the world
have to like you?
944.535
# GEORGE
944.678
Yes. Yes. Everybody has to like me.
I must be liked.
949.147
946.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
951.685
Of course I support your decision
to change your name.
956.119
955.800
**LOL**
# JOEL
956.590
After the Giant game, I realized
that this problem isn't going away.
962.026
# ELAINE
962.229
Well, listen,
I just want you to know...
964.229
964.331
that I was more than willing
to stick it out with Joel Rifkin.
967.832
# JOEL
967.935
Sure.
970.697
971.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
# JOEL
972.606
Okay, you got your list?
973.890
# ELAINE
973.890
Yeah, yeah. Ten names.
975.174
# JOEL
975.242
Great.
976.492
# ELAINE
976.492
Okay, and if somebody objects...
977.742
977.844
you can just veto it.
978.628
# JOEL
978.628
Okay.
979.411
# ELAINE
979.479
Okay, you start.
What's your first choice?
982.742
# JOEL
983.283
Stuart.
984.397
# ELAINE
984.397
No. Second choice.
985.510
# JOEL
986.553
Stuart's no good?
988.177
987.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
988.655
I have never met a normal guy
named Stuart.
992.191
# JOEL
992.659
Okay. My second choice is Todd.
997.253
# ELAINE
997.864
Todd.
1000.228
1000.434
No. Veto.
1002.161
1002.200
**LOL**
# JOEL
1002.269
All right.
1004.064
1004.605
Hey, I think you're gonna like
my third choice.
1007.037
# ELAINE
1007.107
Oh, great.
1008.220
# JOEL
1008.220
Alex.
1009.334
# ELAINE
1010.911
I gotta tell you, I have
a bad association with the name Alex.
1015.107
# JOEL
1015.315
Bad association?
1017.532
# ELAINE
1017.532
In college, I sat next to an Alex...
1019.749
1019.820
in art history.
He always drank coffee...
1022.047
1022.122
and after every sip, he would go:
1024.713
1026.300
**LOL**
1027.160
I mean, every two seconds:
1029.728
1029.796
And he would take, like, 40 sips,
and after every one:
1032.990
1034.034
I had to drop the class.
1035.897
1037.100

to drop off my stuff

# JERRY
1045.278
Oh, no problem. That's fine.
1047.243
# JODI
1047.848

1049.813
# JERRY
1049.916
It's New Age music.
1052.541
1052.619
Sounds of the forest.
1054.914
1055.100
**LOL**
1054.988
I find it soothing.
1056.555
1057.858

A massage table.

What are you doing?
1064.862

Just checking it out.
1066.294
1066.366
Look at how this thing is made.
1068.832
1068.935
Can I tell you something?
That's a hell of a piece of equipment.
1072.471
1072.800
**LOL**
# JODI
1072.572
Actually, I should get a new one.
1075.403
# JERRY

Nonsense. This one's fine.
1078.235
# JODI
1078.478
So where do you wanna go?
1080.360
# JERRY
1080.360
Go? Why go anywhere?
1082.241
1083.583
That feels good.
1085.810

Yeah, that's...

1088.955
That's good.

That's very nice.
1101.028

1101.101
No. No, this isn't good.
I can't do this.
1104.261
# JERRY
1104.337
Why? What's wrong?
1106.098
# JODI
1106.173
I can't.
1107.468
# JERRY

# GEORGE
1119.086
You know what?
1120.983
1121.254
I should go talk to her.
1122.821
1123.256
Nothing confrontational.
Just two adults sitting down...
1126.052
1123.900
**LOL**
1126.126
trying to clear the air.
1127.659
1127.894
I know if I could spend
some time alone with her...
1130.485
1131.031
I've got to. I've got to.

# KAREN

Well, I think I can still catch her.
1135.329
# KAREN
1135.502
All right, George, I have had
just about enough of this.
1138.366
# GEORGE
1138.505
What are you talking about?
1140.188
# KAREN
1140.188
I am talking about you and Jodi.
1141.870
1141.942
You're completely
obsessed with her.

# KAREN
1147.380
Who is more important to you,
her or me?
1149.675
1149.750
I like you, she doesn't.
Who you gonna pick?
1153.308
1156.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1159.259
I'm sorry, Karen. I care for you...
1161.020
1161.094
but I can't stand
when someone doesn't like me.
1163.628

**LOL**
# KAREN
1163.730
Well, now I hate you!

Ned's a guy who buys
irregular underwear. Next.

Ellis.
1181.526

1181.526
Ellis? You might as well go with Alex.
1183.374
1183.300
**LOL**
1183.450
It's the same thing.
1185.451
# ELAINE
1185.451
Ellis and Alex aren't even close.
1187.452

# JERRY
1217.517
Who you kidding?
You come to my apartment...
1219.710
1219.786
with your table and your little oils.
I'm not supposed to expect anything?
1224.289
1224.591
You're a massage teaser.
1226.716

# JODI
1228.361
Listen, I massage who I want
when I want.
1231.396

I don't submit to forcible massage.

What for?
1256.769

We need to talk.
1258.150
# JERRY
1258.225
You need to talk?
1259.424
# JODI
1259.424
We have nothing to talk about.

Look, it's no secret
what's going on between us.
1263.523
1264.000
**LOL**
1264.030
She doesn't like me.
Now, Jerry, if you don't mind...
1266.758
# JERRY
1266.833
George, anything you have to say
to her, you can say in front of me.
1270.926
# GEORGE
1274.374
Jerry...
1276.465
1276.543
this woman hates me so much...
1279.703
1279.779
I'm starting to like her.
1282.313
1282.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
1283.016
What?
1284.784
# GEORGE
1284.784
She just dislikes me so much...
1286.552
1287.153
it's irresistible.
1289.949

Swedes are big massagers. They like
Swedish meatballs, Swedish massage.
1329.758
1329.829
They like having meat in their hands,
these people.
1332.864
1332.300
**LOL**
1332.933
But it's weird.
They have a high suicide rate.
1335.263
1335.335
They're always rubbing
each other's necks.
1337.426
1337.504
For a neutral country,
they seem kind of tense.
1339.868
1340.100
**LOL**
1340.774
I don't like the idea of
a professional massage.
1343.206
1343.310
I don't want people touching me
that don't wanna have sex with me.
1346.937
1346.800
**LOL**
1347.013
You get me all loosened up,
juices flowing, then:
1349.877
1349.950
"That's it. Okay, you're done."
1353.315
1352.700
**LOL**
1353.420
Like having chocolate
rubbed over your face.
