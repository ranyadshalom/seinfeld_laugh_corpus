To me, government...
1.996
2.015
is basically parents for adults.
5.266
2.700
**LOL**
2.800
**LOL**
5.807
Especially the IRS. The IRS is like
Ward and June Cleaver...
9.104
9.611
and we're all
Wally and the Beaver.
12.305
12.400
**LOL**
12.380
And your accountant
is Eddie Haskell...
14.345
14.415
showing you all these neat tricks
to get away with stuff.
17.211
17.000
**LOL**
17.852
That's fine, unless you get audited.
19.544
19.621
Then you don't want some
wise guy in a suit going:
22.246
22.323
"You have a very
lovely office here, sir."
25.722
25.300
**LOL**
25.860
Because jail is the government's
way of sending you to your room.
29.225
29.500
**LOL**
29.297
And when you meet Whitey
and Lumpy in the joint...
32.833
33.568
there's really gonna be
something wrong with the Beaver.
36.899
36.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
42.810
Does he like you?
43.691
# ELAINE
43.691
What do you think?
44.571
# JERRY
44.646
Do you like him?
45.760
# ELAINE
45.760
Yeah, I like him. Definitely.
46.873
46.948
I like him a lot.
48.276
# GEORGE
48.349
So, what's wrong with him?
49.679
# ELAINE
49.679
Nothing, and I've looked.
51.009
51.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
51.085
Well, I'm sure you'll find something.
53.449
# JERRY
53.521
So how'd you meet him?
54.469
# ELAINE
54.469
In the office.
55.418
# JERRY
55.490
So he's a writer?
56.456
# ELAINE
56.456
Yeah.
57.421
# JERRY
57.492
Yeah, big surprise.
58.941
58.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
58.941
I was sitting on the reception desk.
60.390
60.461
I was looking pretty hot.
62.620
63.100
**LOL**
62.697
I was wearing my slingback pumps.
64.180
# GEORGE
64.180
What are those?
65.664
# ELAINE
65.733
Ask your mother.
You live with her now, don't you?
68.597
69.203
Anyway...
70.827
70.400
**LOL**
70.905
then this guy comes up to me,
and he starts feeling my jacket...
73.997
74.075
between his thumb
and forefinger like this.
76.666
# JERRY
76.744
So, what'd you do?
77.994
# ELAINE
77.994
I said, "What do you think?"
79.244
79.313
And he said, "Gabardine?"
80.903
80.982
And I said, "Yeah." That was it.
83.949
83.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
85.787
Just felt your material?
87.270
# ELAINE
87.270
Yeah. Jake Jarmel.
88.754
# GEORGE
89.357
Sounds like a cool guy.
90.539
# JERRY
90.539
Sounds like a jerk.
91.721
92.300
**LOL**
91.793
Felt your material, come on.
94.623
# GEORGE
94.696
Jerry, where'd you get that sweater?
96.213
# JERRY
96.213
In the back of my closet.
97.731
# GEORGE
97.799
I think that's what the back
of closets are for.
100.868
100.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
101.769
Hey, that's Barry.
103.359

Hi.
106.773
# GEORGE
106.841
Who is that?
108.256
# JERRY
108.256
That's Barry Prophet, our accountant.
109.671
# GEORGE
109.744
I don't know how can you let
this guy handle your money.
112.312
# ELAINE
112.380
Not my money. He handles
Jerry's money. He just does my taxes.
115.506
# JERRY
115.583
Barry, how you doing?
116.412
# BARRY
116.412
How are you?
117.241
# JERRY
117.318
This is my friend George.
118.067
# BARRY
118.067
Hey.
118.817
# ELAINE
118.886
What are you doing
in this neighborhood?
120.783
# BARRY
120.855
Nothing, really.
122.479
123.024
You... You eat here?
124.138
# JERRY
124.138
Yeah.
125.251
125.500
**LOL**
125.326
So how's my money?
126.741
# BARRY
126.741
Well, it's still green.
128.156
# JERRY
128.229
What, do you got a cold?
129.229
# BARRY
129.229
No. No.
130.229
# ELAINE
130.832
Look at that ring.
132.582
# BARRY
132.582
Oh, you like that?
134.333
135.200
**LOL**
136.104
Hey, say, where's the bathroom?
137.694
# JERRY
137.772
Bathroom?
Bathroom's right over there.
139.863
# BARRY
139.941
Great.
141.736
# JERRY
143.511
Did you see that?
144.839
# ELAINE
144.912
See what?
145.894
# GEORGE
145.894
Yes, I saw that.
146.877
# ELAINE
146.948
What?
147.982
# JERRY
147.982
What was all that sniffing?
149.016
# ELAINE
149.083
I don't know.
150.180
# JERRY
150.180
You don't think..?
151.276
# ELAINE
151.352
Oh, no. Come on, Jerry.
153.818
# GEORGE
153.888
He was definitely sniffing.
156.616
157.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
157.458
I mean, what if..?
This guy's got all my money.
160.026
160.094
Plus, I got some of Kramer's money
with him.
162.128
162.196
He can write checks to himself
from my account.
164.423
# ELAINE
164.499
I've known this guy since college.
He doesn't do drugs.
167.067
# JERRY
167.135
Then what was all that sniffing?
168.749
# ELAINE
168.749
Maybe it's the cold weather.
170.363
# JERRY
170.438
Today's not cold.
171.937
172.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
172.006
All right, I gotta get going.
My parents are expecting me.
175.132

Don't forget to wash
your hands before supper.

**LOL**
# FRANK
184.118
What do you need
all that ketchup for?
186.652
186.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
188.156
This is my ketchup.
190.383
190.200
**LOL**
190.691
I bought this ketchup...
192.156
192.226
just so I could have
as much as I want.
195.352
195.000
**LOL**
# FRANK
197.698
So I...
I talked to Phil Kassikoff today.

# ESTELLE
201.135
Phil Kassikoff?
202.759
# FRANK
202.837
Yeah. You know, my friend,
the bra salesman?
205.098
205.540
He says they're looking
for somebody...
207.574
207.642
so I got you an interview
next Friday with his boss.
210.302
# GEORGE
210.378
Next Friday? What time?
211.474
# FRANK
211.474
Two o'clock.
212.571
# GEORGE
213.047
That's my whole afternoon.
I was gonna look for sneakers.
216.514
215.600
**LOL**
# FRANK
216.584
You can look for sneakers
the next day!
218.652
# ESTELLE
220.154
He doesn't know anything
about bras.
222.848
223.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
225.827
I know a little.
227.861
227.900
**LOL**
228.362
Besides, what do you
have to know?
230.259
# FRANK
230.331
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go in
and be able to discuss it intelligently.
234.697
234.500
**LOL**
234.769
Maybe you should take a look
at a few bras.
236.996
237.071
Where's your bra?
Give him a bra to look at.
239.105
# ESTELLE
239.173
I'm not giving him a bra.
240.706
# FRANK
240.775
Why not?
242.406
# ESTELLE
242.406
I don't need him looking at my bra.
244.038
# FRANK
244.111
Fine. He'll go into the interview...
245.872
245.100
**LOL**
245.947
he wouldn't know
what he's talking about.
248.072
# GEORGE
248.149
Do we have to..?
250.012
# FRANK
250.084
You don't even know
what they're made from.
252.243
250.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
252.320
They're made from Lycra spandex.
254.133
254.100
**LOL**
# FRANK
254.133
Get out of here. Lycra spandex?
255.947
# ESTELLE
256.023
I think they are made
from Lycra spandex.
258.421
258.900
**LOL**
# FRANK
258.492
Wanna bet? How much?
259.492
# ESTELLE
259.492
I'm not betting.
260.492
# FRANK
260.561
Take a look.
262.562
# ESTELLE
262.562
All right, I'll get a bra.
264.563
264.400
**LOL**
# FRANK
264.632
I don't know what the big problem is
getting a bra.
267.599
# GEORGE
267.668
She doesn't wanna get a bra.
269.292
269.800
**LOL**
# FRANK
269.670
I'm not saying, "Go to the library
and read the history."
272.364
272.440
But it wouldn't kill you
to know a little bit about it.
275.441
275.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
275.509
All right, it wouldn't kill me.
277.770
# FRANK
280.781
How long does it take to find a bra?
282.849
283.500
**LOL**
283.150
What's going on in there?
284.911
284.986
You ask me to get a pair of
underwear, I'm back in two seconds.
288.385
288.500
**LOL**
289.624
You know about the cup sizes
and all?
292.318
292.600
**LOL**
294.395
They have different cups.
296.630

304.438
the B...
305.869
305.940
the C...
307.598
307.909
the D. That's the biggest.
310.443
311.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
311.579
I know the D is the biggest.
313.579
313.648
I base my whole life on knowing
that the D is the biggest.

Here. Here's the bra.
318.784

Let me see it.
319.983
# ESTELLE
320.054
"One hundred percent
Lycra spandex."
322.679
# FRANK
322.757
Let me see.
323.803
# ESTELLE
323.803
I told you.
324.848

Here. You think you know
everything.
328.257

329.730
That's surprising.
331.457
331.500
**LOL**
332.033
All right, what else?
333.794
333.868
You got the cups in the front...
336.300
336.300
**LOL**
336.370
two loops in the back, all right?
339.132
339.206
I guess that's about it.
341.037
# GEORGE
341.037
I got it. Cups in front, loops in back.
342.867
# ESTELLE
342.944
You got ketchup on it.

Sniffing? What do you mean,
sniffing?
353.920
# JERRY
353.988
Sniffing. With his nose.
355.602
# KRAMER
355.602
Jerry, he probably had a cold.
357.216
# JERRY
357.291
No, he didn't. I asked him.
358.826
# KRAMER
358.826
So, what are you saying?
360.360
# JERRY
360.428
I don't know. You know, what if..?
362.077
# KRAMER
362.077
Drugs?
363.725

You think he's on drugs?

I don't know.
366.093
# KRAMER

Jerry...
367.082
# JERRY
367.082
All I know is he was sniffing.
367.996
# KRAMER
368.069
Listen, we went in on a CD together.
369.183
# JERRY
369.183
I know.
370.296
# KRAMER
370.371
And Newman gave you money too.
371.938
372.006
See, I didn't even meet this guy.
We trusted you.
374.700
# JERRY
374.775
Look, it doesn't necessarily
mean anything yet.
377.105
377.178
It just means he was sniffing.
378.678
# KRAMER
378.678
Well, what else? Was he nervous?
380.179
380.247
Did he use a lot of slang?
Did he use the word "man"?
384.113
384.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
386.120
No, he didn't use "man."
387.585
# KRAMER
387.655
I mean, when he was leaving,
did he say, "I'm splitting"?
390.781
390.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
391.559
No, but at one point,
he did use the bathroom.

398.265
You think that's a bad sign?

Yes, that's what they do.

400.900

They live in the bathroom.

What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get our money, right?

# JERRY

I don't know.
This sweater really itches me.

You got a few messages.
433.600

Oh, yeah. I'll call you back.

Forget that...
Myra had the baby!
448.414

Oh, my God. That's wonderful.
450.209
450.284
Who called?
451.000
# JAKE
451.000
She did.
451.715

She did? Oh, that's so great.
454.218
# JAKE
454.555
Where do you keep the corkscrew?
456.238

It's in the drawer on the right.
457.920

461.962
What?
463.495
# ELAINE
463.597
No, it's nothing.
465.255
# JAKE
465.332
No, what is it?
466.497
# ELAINE
466.497
It's nothing.
467.662
# JAKE
467.835
Tell me.
469.425
# ELAINE
469.870
Well, I was just curious why you
didn't use an exclamation point.
474.532
475.300
**LOL**
# JAKE
476.911
What are you talking about?
478.273
# ELAINE
478.345
Well, see right here? You wrote,
"Myra had the baby."
480.777
480.848
But you didn't use
an exclamation point.
483.746
484.200
**LOL**
# JAKE
483.818
So?
485.510
# ELAINE
485.586
So it's... Yeah, it's nothing.
Forget it. Forget it.
488.177
488.255
You know, I just found it curious.
490.323

490.391
Wait, what's so curious about it?
493.153
491.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
493.227
Well, I mean, if one of your
close friends had a baby...
497.263
497.331
and I left you a message about it,
I would use an exclamation point.
500.696
# JAKE
500.768
Well, maybe I don't use
my exclamation points...
502.995
503.070
as haphazardly as you do.
505.297
506.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
506.173
You don't think
that someone having a baby...
508.969
509.043
warrants an exclamation point?

Hey, look, I just jotted down
the message.
513.079
513.147
I didn't know that I was required
to capture the mood of each caller.
516.614
# ELAINE
516.851
Well, I just thought you'd be a little
more excited about a friend of mine...
521.183
517.600
**LOL**
521.255
having a baby.
522.289
# JAKE
522.289
Okay, I'm excited.
523.323
523.390
I just don't happen to like
exclamation points.
525.822
# ELAINE
525.893
Well, Jake, you should
learn to use them.
527.984
528.062
Like, the way I'm talking now,
I'd put exclamation points...
531.029
531.098
on the ends all of these sentences!
On this one! And on that one!
534.690
# JAKE
534.768
Well, you can put one on this one:
537.200
535.500
**LOL**
537.271
I'm leaving!

# JERRY

You're out of your mind.
545.127
# ELAINE
545.127
Why?
546.075
# JERRY
546.147
It's an exclamation point.
548.181
548.700
**LOL**
548.249
It's a line with a dot under it.
550.113
# ELAINE
550.113
Well, I felt it called for one.
551.978
# JERRY
552.052
"Called for one." I thought
I'd heard of everything.
554.450
552.900
**LOL**
554.522
I never heard of a relationship
being affected by punctuation.
557.614
557.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
557.691
I found it very troubling
that he didn't use one.

George is right.
Didn't take you long.
564.424

# KRAMER
567.902
Anything new with that guy
on drugs?
569.936
# ELAINE
570.271
He's not on drugs.
571.963
# KRAMER
572.039
Then why the sniffing?
Who walks around... sniffing?
576.200
576.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
576.277
All right, here.
You call him right now, okay?
578.470

Yeah, and they come back with
things taped to their large intestine.
611.841
611.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
612.646
So because of a few bad apples...
614.475
614.548
you're gonna impugn
an entire continent?
616.843
# JERRY

Yes, I'm impugning a continent.

What kind of snow blower
did you get us mixed up with?

**LOL**
# ELAINE
636.237
Okay, gentlemen, the fact remains
you still have no proof.
640.137
640.207
This is all speculation and hearsay.
642.605
# KRAMER
642.676
Wait. There's one way to find out.
We set up a sting.

You gonna put on phony beards
and dress up like Arab sheiks...

and sit around
in some hotel room?

# JERRY
659.141
Wait a second.

Maybe there is a way to tempt him
and find out.

No, but...
927.785

I have a very good rapport
with women.
930.452
930.531
Very good. Comfortable.
932.462
932.533
And from the first time I laid eyes
on a brassiere...
936.831
936.904
I was enthralled.
938.631

945.679
I was in my friend's bathroom...
948.043
948.115
his mother's brassiere
was hanging over the shower rod.
952.117
951.600
**LOL**
952.252
I picked it up.
953.910
953.987
I studied it.
955.952
956.223
I thought:
957.915
957.991
"I like this."
959.319
959.800
**LOL**
959.393
I didn't know in what way
or on what level, but I knew...

Two cups in the front...

Yes... Yes, I did.
1052.777
1052.700
**LOL**
# LIPPMAN
1052.853
And anyway, I was just reading
your final edit...
1055.945
1056.023
and there seems to be an inordinate
number of exclamation points.
1061.755
1061.700
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1062.062
Well, I... I felt that the writing lacked
a certain emotion and intensity.
1068.465
# LIPPMAN
1068.535
You know, it's...
1069.966
1070.037
"It was a damp and chilly afternoon,
so I decided to put on my sweatshirt!"
1075.439
1076.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1075.942
Right. Well...
1077.270
# LIPPMAN
1077.344
You put an exclamation point
after "sweatshirt."
1079.639
# ELAINE
1079.713
That's correct. I felt that the character
doesn't like to be chilly.
1084.182
# LIPPMAN
1084.251
I see.
1085.579
1085.200

1085.652
"I pulled the lever on the machine,
but the Clark bar didn't come out!"
1089.210
1089.800

1089.956
Again, exclamation point.
1090.905
# ELAINE
1090.905
Yeah.
1091.853
1091.925
Well, you know how frustrating
that can be...
1094.016
1094.094
when you keep putting quarters
and quarters into a machine...
1097.027
1097.097
and... nothing comes out.
1098.865
1098.300
**LOL**
# LIPPMAN
1098.865
Get rid of the exclamation points.
1100.633

"Dear Barry, consider this letter...
1110.436

the termination of our relationship,
effective immediately."

# KRAMER

Exclamation point.
1114.530
# ELAINE
1114.530
Right.
1115.512

You still have no proof.

Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy
around me.

"I will expect all funds in the form

Double exclamation point.

# NEWMAN
1128.595
Will that take care of ours too?
1129.493
# JERRY
1129.493
Yep.
1130.390
1130.464
I'll give you yours as soon as
I get my money back.
1132.896
# NEWMAN
1132.966
Want me to mail it?
I'm on my way out.
1134.761
# JERRY
1134.835
Yeah, thanks.
1136.586

1136.586
All right. Be my pleasure.

Hey, Ralph.

# RALPH
1149.177
What's up, fellas?
1150.274
1150.350
That'll be 14.30.
1151.350

No, man.
1158.989
1159.059
Kramer, what is this?
1160.371
# KRAMER
1160.371
It's a sweater.
1161.684
# RALPH
1161.762
What is it made out of?
1163.194
# KRAMER
1163.194
I don't know. Jerry gave it to me.
1164.626
# JERRY
1164.698
It's mohair, I think.
1165.982
# RALPH
1165.982
Mohair. That figures.
1167.266
1167.334
I'm allergic to mohair.
1169.061
# JERRY
1169.136
You mean, you just started sniffing?

1170.369
Yeah.
1171.602
1171.671
Mohair does it to me every time.

I was wearing that sweater in the
coffee shop when Barry came in.
1178.143

**LOL**
# KRAMER
1178.211
Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.
1180.240
# ELAINE
1180.240
The sweater made him sniff.
1182.270
1182.349
See? I told you he wasn't
a drug addict.
1184.940
# JERRY
1185.018
Oh, no, the letter.
1186.346
1186.419
Newman... It's got
exclamation points all over it.
1189.818

Not to mention the picture of him
on the toilet.

What do you mean,
you felt her material?

1225.592
What? With your fingers, like this?

# GEORGE
1227.327
So what? What's so bad about that?

# ESTELLE
1229.729
Who goes around
feeling people's material?
1232.491
1232.566
What can be gained
by feeling a person's material?
1236.158
1234.600

1236.236
It's insanity.

Whatever happened to, "My,
that's a lovely dress you have on.

May I have this dance?"

You know, you are really lucky
Newman never mailed that letter.

# JERRY
1252.519
Sorry I'm late. I just came from
a meeting with my lawyer.
1255.645
1255.722
Hey.
1256.551
# ELAINE
1256.551
What is this?
1257.380
# JERRY
1257.457
It's a letter from your friend
Barry Prophet's lawyer.
1261.323
# ELAINE
1262.128
He's filing Chapter 11?
1264.287
1264.364
What's going on?
Why is he filing Chapter 11?
1266.557
# JERRY
1266.633
Bankruptcy.
1268.064
1268.134
Bankruptcy. As in, "I've taken
your money and spent it on drugs."
1271.226
# ELAINE
1272.072
What? I thought it was the sweater.
1274.003
# KRAMER
1274.074
What about the money?
1275.137
# JERRY
1275.137
What about the money?
1276.199
1276.276
If I had dissolved my relationship
with him...
1278.435
1278.511
prior to his filing Chapter 11,
I could've got the money back.
1281.637
1281.715
Which I would've done...
1283.043
1283.116
if a certain imbecile had been able
to get to a mailbox and mail a letter.

Half silk, half cotton, half linen.

How can you go wrong?

1320.153
My accountant actually did...
1322.744
1323.300
**LOL**
1322.822
take a big chunk of money from me
and use it to buy drugs.
1326.187
1326.259
The thing that was hardest for me
to comprehend about this...
1329.089
1329.162
is the life choice of drug abuse
and accounting.
1333.756
1332.900
**LOL**
1334.801
It makes sense. Why would
an athlete or musician take drugs?
1337.563
1337.637
They have an interesting job.
1339.102
1339.172
But an accountant? If ever a job
required hallucinogenic support...
1342.901
1340.100
**LOL**
1342.976
this is the job.
1344.805
1344.400
**LOL**
1344.878
That should be the legal defense.
1347.276
1347.347
"You're charged with
possession of illegal narcotics."
1350.143
1350.216
"But, Your Honor,
I'm an accountant."
