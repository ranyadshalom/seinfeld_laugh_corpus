# GEORGE
39.031
If you and I ever got into
a really serious fight, you know...
41.883
41.951
and the punches started flying,
who would win?

Well, no, of course, you don't.
You're a man's woman.

Saddle up and ride.

Yeah, why not Susan?
139.231

I should be friends with Susan.
140.903
140.977
Of course, Susan.
143.615

154.826
This world here,
this is George's sanctuary.
157.927

If Susan comes into contact
with this world, his worlds collide.

And the worst part is, after the movie
he leeched onto us...
305.927
305.994
we wound up having
coffee with him for two hours.
308.419
308.496
Then he walks us home, all the way
back to the building.
311.266
311.333
Finally, I said, "Look, Ramon,
I gotta go to bed now."

328.811
What'd you do that for?
330.109

330.729
She was looking for someone
to go to the show with.
333.285
# GEORGE
333.524
Well, that was really a stupid thing.

# GEORGE
339.322
Yeah.
341.047
340.300
**LOL**
# JERRY

345.037
and if it comes in contact with this...
346.813
# GEORGE
346.813
Yes, it blows up.

350.640
# JERRY
350.710
I didn't know. Kramer told me
about the worlds.

# GEORGE
352.962
You couldn't figure out
the worlds theory for yourself?
355.768
355.841
It's just common sense.
357.483

# JERRY
554.603
What?
555.881
# JERRY
555.881
It's Ramon, Jerry. I'm coming up.
557.159
557.815
Oh, okay.
559.160
559.233
What is he doing here?
560.792
# ELAINE
560.860
Who? Who is Ramon?
562.179
# JERRY
562.179
He's the pool guy.
563.498
# ELAINE
563.571
What pool guy?
564.393
# JERRY
564.393
Do me a favour.
565.214
565.281
Stick around while he's here.
566.410
# ELAINE
566.410
Yeah, no problem.

# ELAINE
# JERRY
567.617
Hey, Jerry, how are you, crazy guy?
570.209
# JERRY
571.455
So, Ramon, this is my friend Elaine.
573.089
# ELAINE
573.089
Yeah, and I was just leaving.
574.722
575.400

578.046
Bye-bye, Jerry.

# JERRY
582.425
What are you doing around here?
583.810
# RAMON
583.810
I was in the neighbourhood.
585.195
585.262
I figured I'd check you out.
586.729
# JERRY
586.729
I kind of had some things to do.
588.197
# RAMON
588.265
Oh, yeah? Where are you going?
590.157
# JERRY
590.226
Just, you know, I don't know.
Stuff I gotta do.
593.280
# RAMON
593.354
Hey, that's cool.
I'm up for some stuff.
596.409
# JERRY
596.983
All right.
598.708
600.800
**LOL**
# RAMON
602.114
So get this. I get down there...
604.421
604.492
and right away
I see the drain is clogged.
607.628
608.300
**LOL**
607.703
It's obvious. Can you believe that?
609.728
# JERRY
609.728
All right, Ramon. I'm gonna get going.
611.754
613.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
613.251
I think we should separate here.
614.885
# RAMON
614.885
What are you trying to say, Jerry?
616.518
# JERRY
616.588
Look. You're a nice guy,
but I actually only have three friends.
619.773
619.842
I really can't handle any more.
621.271
# RAMON
621.344
I see. It's because I clean pools,
right?
623.401
# JERRY
623.471
That has nothing to do with it.
625.896
627.700
**LOL**
# RAMON
# SUSAN
629.144
Yeah, we got along real well.
631.201
# GEORGE
631.271
Because, you know,
she has no female friends.
634.788
634.700
**LOL**
634.859
You know that, don't you?
637.117
637.195
Something strange about a woman
whose friends are all men.
640.462
640.900
**LOL**
# SUSAN
640.532
Yeah, I know.
We talked all about that.
644.215
# GEORGE
644.286
You talked all about that?
645.356
# SUSAN
645.356
Oh, yeah.
646.426
646.497
Elaine opened up her vault.
649.598
650.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
651.544
Did you just say "vault"?
652.972
# SUSAN
653.045
Yeah, why? Did I use it wrong?
654.973
# GEORGE
655.215
You got that from Elaine?
656.560
# SUSAN
656.633
Yeah. So what?
659.224
# GEORGE
659.302
Well, it's a little strange.
661.395
661.472
Are you gonna start
to talk like Elaine from now on?
664.526
# SUSAN
664.600
I don't know.
665.945
665.400

666.018
Anyway, I thought
we'd all go to a movie on Friday.

This is not good.
674.826

Worlds are colliding.
677.577
677.656
George is getting upset!
680.330
679.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
685.915
You have no idea
of the magnitude of this thing.
689.182
689.252
If she is allowed
to infiltrate this world...
692.223
692.297
then George Costanza,
as you know him, ceases to exist.
696.146
696.500
**LOL**
696.761
You see, right now,
I have relationship George...
700.396
700.473
but there is also
independent George.
704.322
704.394
That's the George you know,
the George you grew up with.
707.365
707.439
Movie George, coffee-shop George,
liar George, bawdy George.
712.202
# JERRY
712.278
I love that George.
714.849
# GEORGE
714.849
Me too. And he's dying, Jerry.
717.420
715.800
**LOL**
717.492
If relationship George
walks through this door...
720.546
720.620
he will kill independent George.
723.212
722.400
**LOL**
724.208
A George divided against itself
cannot stand.
728.555
728.900

You're killing independent George.
You know that, don't you?

736.013
George, I don't even wanna get...

You know what word Susan
used last night? "Vault."
741.406
# ELAINE
741.477
So?
742.773
# GEORGE
742.773
She got that from you.
744.068
# ELAINE
744.147
Well, I didn't tell her to say it.
745.907
# GEORGE
745.982
Is she the only girl in the whole world?
Can't you find your own?
749.083
# ELAINE
749.152
I like her.
750.877

He's really making things
uncomfortable for me.

866.699
There's always a big pile
of dirty towels in front of my locker.

my towel is always gone.
