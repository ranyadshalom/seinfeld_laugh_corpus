**LOL**
14.026
Is it from the endless hours of reading
and studying and researching...
17.294
17.364
that this person supposedly
blew out their eyeballs?
20.216
20.284
And that's why
they need the glasses?
23.053
21.000
**LOL**
23.120
It's a corrective device. If you see
someone with a hearing aid...
26.222
26.291
you don't think, "Oh, they must
have been listening real good.
29.262

173.377
I met a guy that knows you,
he gave it to me.
176.348

I don't remember his name.
I think it began with a W, maybe a Q.
180.065
180.400

180.635
I wasn't paying attention.
I'd just come from shopping...
