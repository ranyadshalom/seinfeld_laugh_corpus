Now I was thinking the other day about...
3.787
3.812
hair and that the weird thing about it...
6.342
6.367
is that people will touch
other people's hair.
9.404
9.477
You will actually kiss another
human being right on the head...
12.774
12.847
but if one of those hairs...
14.881
14.949
should somehow be able to get out
of that skull and go off on its own...
20.385
18.400
**LOL**
20.454
it is now the vilest, most disgusting
thing that you can encounter.
25.787
25.900
**LOL**
26.560
The same hair.
28.127
28.195
People freak out,
"There was a hair in the egg salad."
33.164
32.500
**LOL**

Say it's Saturday night in Spain.
They go out dancing.
41.635
41.709
Think they do the flamenco?
43.800
43.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
44.278
I would think.
45.640
# GEORGE
45.713
So you could call a woman
for a date...
47.508
47.581
ask her if she's free
for dinner and a flamenco.
50.172
# JERRY
50.785
You don't flamenco on the first date.
53.752
53.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
53.821
I wish the flamenco
was popular here.
55.684
# JERRY
55.756
Yeah? Would you do it?
57.535
# GEORGE
57.535
Yes, I think I would.
59.314
59.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
59.393
Well, I knew you had
an affinity for it...
61.324
61.395
because it's the dance
of a very proud people.
64.055
63.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
64.465
Hello. Oh, hi, Nana. What?
68.160
68.235
Oh, all right.
Okay, don't worry about it.
70.860
70.938
Okay, I'll see you later.
All right, bye.
74.064
# JERRY
74.141
I have to go over my grandmother's.
75.238
# GEORGE
75.238
What for?
76.334
# JERRY
76.410
I have to open
a bottle of ketchup for her.
78.910
78.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
80.548
So, what, no lunch?
81.980
# JERRY
81.980
No, we have time.
83.412
# GEORGE
83.818
How's she doing?
85.165
# JERRY
85.165
She's starting to slip a little.
86.512
86.587
She has trouble distinguishing
between the past and the present.
89.554
# GEORGE
89.723
There's gotta be an easier way
to open ketchup.
91.882
91.959
They should make it in a tube.
93.549
# JERRY
93.828
Like toothpaste?
94.640
# GEORGE
94.640
Yeah.
95.452
# JERRY
95.529
There's a squeeze ketchup.
96.796
96.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
96.796
I've seen squeeze mustard.
98.063
98.132
I've never seen squeeze ketchup.
99.650
# JERRY
99.650
If they make squeeze mustard...
101.167
101.100
**LOL**
101.235
doesn't it stand to reason
they make squeeze ketchup?
103.496
# GEORGE
103.571
Not necessarily.
Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.
106.435
# JERRY
106.507
I don't see the difference.
107.689
# GEORGE
107.689
There's a difference.
108.871
109.500
**LOL**
108.943
It's subtle.
109.659
# JERRY
109.659
It's subtle?
110.374
# GEORGE
110.444
Hey, isn't Elaine
supposed to meet us?
112.739
# JERRY
112.813
Yeah, there she is.
114.904
# GEORGE
115.549
What?
116.877
# JERRY
116.951
She's with her friend Wendy.
118.848
119.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
118.919
Wendy?
Is that the physical therapist?
121.419
# JERRY
121.489
Yeah. I'm on a kiss-hello
program with her.
123.887
124.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
123.958
Really?
124.873
# JERRY
124.873
Yeah. Every time I see her...
125.787
125.860
I gotta kiss hello.
I did it once on her birthday.
128.292
128.362
Somehow it mushroomed.
Now I dread seeing her because of it.
132.057
# ELAINE
132.133
Hey.
133.548
132.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
133.548
I'm down to one kiss hello.
134.963
135.035
My aunt Celia.
136.649
# JERRY
136.649
That's fortunate. I really admire that.
138.263
# GEORGE
138.339
Really? I never heard you say
you admired me for anything.
141.738
141.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
141.809
No, I told you I admire your hearing.
144.673
144.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
144.979
Oh, don't slough that off.
You have great hearing.
148.105
148.182
Hey.
149.415
149.415
Hi.
150.648
151.400
**LOL**
151.185
Did you ever meet George?
152.168
# ELAINE
152.168
Wendy.
153.150
# GEORGE
153.387
You're a physical therapist, right?
154.404
# WENDY
154.404
Yes.
155.421
# GEORGE
155.489
You know,
I got this little swelling right here.
158.251
158.325
It's kind of painful.
What do you make of that?
160.586
159.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
160.661
George...
161.791
# WENDY
161.791
Have you tried heat and ice on it?
162.922
# GEORGE
163.197
Oh, that... That really seems
like a lot of trouble.
165.822
166.400
**LOL**
# WENDY
166.000
You could come by my office later.
I could work on it for you.
168.933
# GEORGE
169.003
Oh, okay.
170.502
# WENDY
170.571
Let me give you my card.
171.899
# GEORGE
171.972
Oh, thank you.
173.205
172.600
**LOL**
# WENDY
173.205
Well, I'll see you guys later.
174.438
174.508
Nice meeting you. Bye.
175.622
# ELAINE
175.622
Bye, Wendy. I'm sorry.
176.735
# WENDY
176.810
Bye, Jerry.
177.844
# JERRY
177.844
Bye.
178.878
179.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
179.480
What did you do that for?
180.542
# GEORGE
180.542
What?
181.605
# ELAINE
181.682
Ask about your arm.
183.909
184.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
185.452
I still don't see why I can't
ask her about my arm.
187.816
# ELAINE
187.888
She's a physical therapist.
189.285
189.356
She doesn't wanna have to deal
with that outside the office.
192.118
# GEORGE
192.193
Why not?
193.961
# ELAINE
193.961
Because it is what she does.
195.729
# GEORGE
195.796
I love these people.
You can't ask them questions.
198.091
198.165
They're so mentally gifted that we
mustn't disturb the delicate genius...
201.496
201.569
unless it's in the confines
of an office.
203.603
204.100
**LOL**
203.671
When huge sums of money are
involved, the genius can be disturbed.
208.299
208.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
208.375
George, you got a little
something right here.
210.841
# GEORGE
210.911
People think they're so important.
212.457
# JERRY
212.457
I'm going on record right now.
214.003
213.100
**LOL**
214.081
That was my last kiss hello. I am
getting off the kiss program with her.
217.673
217.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
217.751
Why?
218.984
# JERRY
218.984
Well, you know, frankly...
220.217
220.287
outside of a sexual relationship,
I don't see the point to it.
223.982
224.058
I'm not thrilled with the handshaking
either, but one step at a time.
227.992
227.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
228.429
What are you getting?
229.793
# JERRY
229.793
And what's with that hairdo?
231.157
# ELAINE
231.232
Oh, yeah. I know.
It's not very flattering.
234.563
# JERRY
234.635
I mean, she looks like something
out of an old high school yearbook.
238.171
237.800
**LOL**
238.239
You should say something to her.
239.772
# ELAINE
239.840
Oh, I could never say anything
to her about that.
242.135
# JERRY
242.209
Yeah, Kramer's the only person
who could say something like that.
245.335
245.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
245.412
Yeah.
246.879
# GEORGE
246.879
Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.
248.345
# ELAINE
248.415
No. If you tell him to do it,
he'll never do it.
251.313
# JERRY
251.385
What you have to do is introduce him,
and then he'll just come out with it.
254.818
# ELAINE
254.888
Yes. Yes, you're right. That's right.
257.013
255.600

257.091
I'll bring her over to meet Kramer.

# KRAMER
267.697
I'm putting everybody's picture up...
269.027
269.103
in the lobby of our building.
270.484
# JERRY
270.484
Why?
271.865
# KRAMER
271.939
Everyone will know everybody's name.
People are gonna be a lot friendlier.
276.135
# JERRY
276.210
I don't want my picture
plastered up in the lobby.
278.801
# KRAMER
278.879
Imagine walking by someone on
the floor and you say, "Hey, Carl"...
282.574
282.650
and he says, "Hey, Jerry." That's
the kind of society I wanna live in.
287.517

**LOL**
# JERRY
287.921
Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk
every time I go in the building.
291.320
291.392
I just wanna nod
and be on my way.
293.289
# KRAMER
293.360
You know,
your eyeliner's smudged a little.

Why do you wear
so much eye makeup?

Your father won $1000

Listen, Jerry, she never dates...

Hello. Oh, hi, Mom.
474.673

Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I
had to help her open a ketchup bottle.
478.937
479.346
Hey, Mom, let me ask you a question.
481.141
481.215
Do you remember
when you were a kid...
483.977
484.100
**LOL**
484.351
your father winning,
like, $1000 at the track?
488.251
488.422
Really?
489.921
489.990
Did you know
he gave Uncle Leo $100...
492.058
492.125
and he was supposed
to give you 50?
494.716
494.500
**LOL**
494.862
How do I know? Because Nana
doesn't know what year it is...
497.931
497.998
and she thinks
this just happened.
500.430
500.000
**LOL**
501.134
Well, I think you should.
503.225
503.303
Okay. Bye.

# MORTY

Do you know what the interest
on that $50 comes to over 53 years?

510.500
**LOL**
# HELEN
510.210
Oh, Morty, please.
511.641
# MORTY
514.982
and that's figuring conservatively
at 5 percent interest...
518.017
518.085
over 53 years
compounded quarterly.
521.245
521.321
Or if you put it into a 10-year T-bill...

It's the obligation. You know,
as soon as this person comes in...

550.217
you know you have to do this.
552.217
552.286
I mean, if you could, say, touch
a breast as part of the kiss hello...
556.914
556.700

then I think I could see
the value in it a little better.

I was wondering, could you get
to that shower today, you think?
1119.047
# JULIO
1119.119
Oh, I see. When you need something
done, then you're friendly to people.
1122.620
# JERRY
1122.689
No, no. That's not true.
1124.002

# JULIO
1124.002
Well, I think it is.
1125.314
1125.391
It's a big building, Seinfeld.
Maybe I'll get to it someday...
1128.619
1128.695
after I take care of the people
that are civil to each other.

# JERRY
1137.670
She really doesn't belong here.
My uncle put her here...
1140.432
1140.507
because he's trying to prove
he doesn't owe my mother $50.
1143.337
# NURSE
1143.676
Well, she seems very happy.
1146.142
1146.212
She met an old friend
who used to live next door to her.

Wendy...
1177.567
1177.644
I injured my shoulder Wednesday
when you dropped me off...
1181.009
1181.080
and I had to carry my skis and my
boots and my poles all the way home.
1185.048
1185.118
I'm having trouble lifting my arm.
1187.277
1187.353
You think you could
give me some treatment?
1189.353
# WENDY

Oh, sure.
You have insurance, right?

Wednesday?
1198.358
1198.431
That's your personal business?
Skiing?
1201.500
1201.100
**LOL**
1201.568
Sure. Let people suffer while
you're shooshing all over a mountain.

I hear everything.

All right, why don't you two just
take your business elsewhere.

That is a good idea.

And you know, you might wanna
do something about that hair.
1225.120

**LOL**
# WENDY
1226.292
Why? What's wrong with my hair?
1227.882

I think it's a little
old-fashioned, don't you?
1232.464
1231.600

Tell her.

Oh, yeah. He won $1000.
His son was there too.

Oh, what an obnoxious little kid.
1249.009
1249.100
**LOL**
1249.082
He used to steal my soda bottles
and cash them in for the deposit.
1252.242
# JERRY
1252.852
Is that so?
1254.180
# BUDDY
1254.320
After your grandfather hit
the daily double, he gave him $100...
1257.355
1257.423
and told him to give $50
to his sister.
1259.388
1259.459
His sister?
1260.958
1261.027
Well, I said he should give it to me
for all the bottles he took.
1264.096
1264.700

1268.933
1269.002
I just met an old acquaintance
of yours. You remember Buddy.
1272.538
1272.605
He just told me quite a story about
you and Grandpa at the track.
