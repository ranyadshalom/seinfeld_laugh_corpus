To me, government is basically
parents for adults.
4.674
3.300
**LOL**
5.968
Especially the IRS.
6.649
6.682
The IRS is like
Ward and June Cleaver,
8.815
9.703
and we're all
Wally and the Beaver.
12.669
12.703
And your accountant
is Eddie Haskell
14.669
14.703
showing you all these
neat tricks
16.169
16.203
to get away with stuff.
17.769
17.803
Which is fine
unless you get audited.
19.769
19.803
Then you don't want
some wise guy in a suit,
21.569
21.603
just standing there going:
22.769
22.803
"You have a very lovely office
here, sir."
26.169
26.203
Because jail
is the government's way
28.169
28.203
of sending you to your room.
29.769
29.803
And when you meet Whitey
and Lumpy in the joint,
30.000
33.703
there's really going to be
something wrong with the Beaver.

So, does he like you?
What do you think?

# JERRY
44.626
Do you like him?
Yeah, yeah, I like him.

Definitely like him.
I like him a lot.
48.392

**LOL**
# GEORGE
48.426
So, what's wrong
with him?
49.559
# ELAINE
49.592
Nothing, and I've looked.
50.759
# GEORGE
50.792
Well, I'm sure
you'll find something.
53.592
# JERRY
53.626
So, how'd you meet him?
In the office.
55.559
# ELAINE
# JERRY
55.592
So, he's a writer?
Yeah.
57.559
# ELAINE
# JERRY
57.592
Yeah, big surprise.
58.792
59.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
58.826
So, I was sitting
on the reception desk,
60.626
60.659
I was looking pretty hot,
62.792
62.700
**LOL**
62.826
I was wearing
my sling-back pumps.
64.626
# GEORGE
64.659
What are those?
65.826
# ELAINE
65.859
Ask your mother.
67.059
67.092
You live with her now,
don't you?
68.163
68.792
Anyway, so then this guy
comes up to me,
72.592
69.850
**LOL**
72.626
and he starts feeling
my jacket,
74.259
74.292
between his thumb
and his forefinger, like this.
76.792
# JERRY
76.826
So what'd you do?
78.126
# ELAINE
78.159
I said,
"so, what do you think?"
79.559
79.592
and he said, "Gabardine?"
80.992
81.026
and I said, "yeah."
That was it.
84.126
83.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
85.092
Wow. Just felt
your material?
87.292

Yeah. Jake Jarmel.
88.792
# GEORGE
88.826
Wow. Sounds like
a cool guy.
90.759
# JERRY
90.792
Sounds like a jerk.
91.826

"Felt your material,"
come on.
94.759
# GEORGE
94.792
Jerry, where'd you get
that sweater?
96.326
# JERRY
96.359
Yeah, what do you think? I found
it in the back of my closet.
98.163
# GEORGE
98.826
I think that's what
the back of closets are for.

107.859
That's Barry Prophet.
He's our accountant.
109.726
# GEORGE
109.759
I don't know how you can let
this guy handle all your money.
112.226
# ELAINE
112.259
Oh, he doesn't handle my money,
he handles Jerry's money.
114.626
114.659
He just does my taxes.

What?

Oh, no! Come on, Jerry.

He was definitely
sniffing.

**LOL**
# JERRY
156.992
I mean, what if--?
158.163
158.759
This guy's got all my money.
160.226
160.259
Plus I got some
of Kramer's money with him.
162.059
162.092
This guy can write checks
to himself,
163.659
163.692
right out of my account.
164.659
# ELAINE
164.692
I have known this guy
since college,
166.226
166.259
He doesn't do drugs.
167.226
# JERRY
167.259
Then what was all that sniffing?
168.592
# ELAINE
168.626
Maybe it's the cold weather.
170.426
# JERRY
170.459
Today's not cold.
171.426
# GEORGE
171.459
All right.

What do you need
all that ketchup for?
185.826
# GEORGE
187.859
This is my ketchup.
188.163
189.859
I bought this ketchup,
191.826
191.859
just so I could have
as much as I wanted.
195.359
194.000
**LOL**

202.359
Yeah. You know,
my friend the bra salesman.
205.126
205.159
He says they're looking
to maybe put somebody on,
207.592
207.626
so I got you an interview
next Friday with his boss.
210.292
# GEORGE

Next Friday? What time?
211.926
# FRANK
211.959
2:00.
213.126

213.159
That's my whole afternoon.
214.826
215.200
**LOL**
214.859
I was gonna look for sneakers.
216.492
# FRANK
216.526
You can look for sneakers
the next day!
218.163
# ESTELLE
220.092
He doesn't know
anything about bras.
222.859
# GEORGE
225.492
I know a little.
226.826
228.592
Besides,
what do you have to know?
230.226
# FRANK
230.259
Well, it wouldn't hurt
to go in
231.659
231.692
and be able to
discuss it intelligently.
233.926
234.400
**LOL**
233.959
Maybe you should take a look
at a few bras.
236.659
236.692
Where's your bra?
237.759
237.792
Give him a bra
to look at.
238.926
# ESTELLE
238.959
I'm not giving him a bra,
Why not?
241.292
# FRANK
# ESTELLE
241.326
because I don't need him
looking at my bras.
244.126
242.200
**LOL**
# FRANK
244.159
Fine. So he'll go
into the interview
245.826
245.859
He wouldn't know
what he's talking about.
247.659
# GEORGE
247.692
Do we have to...?
248.163
# FRANK
250.092
You don't even know
what they're made from.
252.226
# GEORGE
252.259
They're made from Lycra spandex.
253.892
# FRANK
253.926
Get out of here.
Lycra spandex?
255.959
# ESTELLE
255.992
I think they are made
from Lycra spandex.
257.826
# FRANK
257.859
Do you wanna bet?
How much you wanna bet?
259.559
258.750
**LOL**
# ESTELLE
# FRANK
259.592
I'm not betting.
Take a look.
261.259
# ESTELLE
261.292
All right.
I'll get a bra.
264.559
# FRANK
264.592
I don't know what
the big problem is,
266.126
265.100
**LOL**
266.159
getting a bra.
267.492
# GEORGE
267.526
She doesn't want to get a bra.
269.226
# FRANK
269.259
I'm not saying go to the library
and read the whole history,
271.992
272.026
but it wouldn't kill you
to know a little bit about it.
274.259
# GEORGE
274.292
All right.
It wouldn't kill me.
277.026
275.200

# FRANK
280.159
How long does it take
to find a bra?
282.759
282.950
**LOL**
282.792
What's going on
in there?
284.559
284.592
You ask me to get
a pair of underwear,
286.426
286.459
I'm back
in two seconds.
288.292
288.050
**LOL**
288.326
You know about the cup sizes
and all?
292.259

304.259
the "B,"
305.892
305.926
the "C,"
307.892
307.926
the "D."
308.163
309.259
That's the biggest.
310.459
310.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
311.659
I know the "D" is the biggest.
313.659
313.692
I based my whole life on knowing
that the "D" is the biggest.

One hundred percent
Lycra spandex.

Here.
325.792
325.826
You think you know everything.

328.959
Huh. That's surprising.
330.826
330.900
**LOL**
331.926
All right, what else?
333.659
333.692
You got the cups in the front,
336.292
336.326
two loops in the back.
337.826
337.859
All right,
I guess that's about it.
338.163

with his nose.

on a CD together.

And Newman gave you money too.

this guy.
373.292
373.326
You know. We trusted you.
374.559
# JERRY
374.592
Look, It doesn't necessarily
mean anything yet.
376.826
376.859
It just means he was sniffing.
378.392
# KRAMER
378.426
Well, what else?
Was he nervous?
380.126
380.159
Did he use a lot of slang?
381.659
382.050
**LOL**
381.692
Did he use the word "man"?
384.026
# JERRY
385.759
No, he didn't use "man."
387.459
# KRAMER
387.492
I mean, when he was leaving,
did he say, "I'm splittin'"?
391.326
390.100

# JERRY
391.359
No, but at one point,
he did use the bathroom.

Yes, yes.
That's what they do.

They live
in the bathroom.

what are we gonna do?

We're gonna go get

why you didn't use

# ELAINE
492.592
Well, I mean,
494.326
494.359
if one of your close friends
had a baby,
497.126
497.159
and I left you
a message about it,
498.559
498.592
I would use
an exclamation point.
500.459
# JAKE
500.492
Well, maybe I don't use
my exclamation points,
502.592
502.626
as haphazardly as you do.
504.126
505.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
505.859
You don't think that
someone having a baby
508.659
508.692
warrants an exclamation point?
510.759
# JAKE
510.792
Hey, look, I just
jotted down the message.
512.659
512.692
I didn't know
that I was required,
514.159
514.192
to capture the mood
of each caller.
516.292
# ELAINE
516.326
I just thought that you'd be
a little more excited,
518.163
517.700
**LOL**
519.026
about a friend of mine
having a baby.
522.126
# JAKE
522.159
Okay, I'm excited.
523.459
523.492
I just don't happen to like
exclamation points.
525.559
# ELAINE
525.592
Well, you know Jake,
you should learn to use 'em.
527.626
527.659
Like the way I'm talking
right now,
529.126
529.159
I would put
exclamation points at the ends,
530.959
530.992
of all these sentences!
532.059
532.092
On this one!
And on that one!
534.759
535.000
**LOL**
# JAKE
534.792
You can put one
on this one:
536.959
536.992
I'm leaving!
538.426
543.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
543.859
You're out of your mind,
you know that.
Why?
545.792
# ELAINE
# JERRY
545.826
It's an exclamation point.
547.592
547.626
It's a line
with a dot under it.
548.163
# ELAINE
550.026
Well,
I felt it called for one.
551.726
# JERRY
551.759
"Called for one." You know, I
thought I'd heard of everything.
554.326
554.359
I never heard of a relationship
being affected by punctuation.
556.992
557.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
557.026
I find it very troubling
that he didn't use one.

Didn't take you long.

Oh, he's not on drugs.
571.626
# KRAMER
571.659
Then why the sniffing?
572.759
572.792
Who walks around...sniffing?
575.892
# ELAINE
575.926
All right, here.
You call him right now, okay?

# ELAINE

So because of a few bad apples,
613.726

you still have no proof.

and dress up like Arab sheiks,

and sit around

I have a very good
rapport with women.
930.376

Very good. Comfortable.
932.143

And from the first time
I laid eyes on a brassiere...

944.843
944.876
I was in my friend's bathroom.
947.876
947.909
His mother's brassiere
was hanging over the shower rod.
951.343
951.376
I picked it up,
953.343
953.376
I studied it,
955.809
955.843
I thought, "I like this."

I didn't know in what way
or what level,

to be around brassieres.

That's correct.

Apparently, if I'd dissolved

prior to his filing chapter 11,
I could have got the money back.

My accountant actually did take
a big chunk of money from me,
1324.752
1324.785
and use it to buy drugs.
1326.285
1326.319
And the thing that was hardest
for me to comprehend about this,
1329.085
1329.119
is the life choice
of drug abuse and accounting.
1334.352
1332.600

1334.385
But actually, it makes sense.
1335.619

Why would and athlete
or musician take drugs?
1337.619
1337.652
They have an interesting job.
1339.119
1339.152
But an accountant?
1340.419
1340.452
If ever a job required
some hallucinogenic support,
1342.819
1342.852
this is the job.

the legal defense.
