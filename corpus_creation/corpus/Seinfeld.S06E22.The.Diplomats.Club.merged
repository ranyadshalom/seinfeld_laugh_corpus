How about the little scam
2.419
2.453
the airlines have going now
with these special clubs.
5.547
5.581
Hundred and fifty dollar a year
to sit in a room, eat peanuts,
8.547
8.581
drink coffee and soda
and read magazines.
11.481
11.514
Excuse me,
isn't this the flight?
14.381
12.200
**LOL**
14.414
I already got four hours
of this coming to me.
17.081
17.114
What am I paying for?
19.214
19.247
How about an
I-got-all-my-luggage club?
21.047
19.950
**LOL**
21.081
Can I get into that?
Where is that club?
23.081
23.114
I would like to join that club.
24.547
27.081
Airlines love to divide
us up into classes.
29.347
29.381
You know, like when you're
sitting in coach,
30.000
31.247
they always have the stewardess
32.581
32.614
close that stupid curtain,
you know?
34.514
34.547
They always give you
that little look like,

"Maybe if you had worked
a little harder."

JERRY:
What time does
your flight get in?
45.714
45.747
Six? All right.
That gives us 6 hours.
48.081
48.114
Then I'll meet you
at the Diplomat's Club.
50.314
50.347
I'll be the one
without the big red sash.
52.514
51.900
**LOL**
52.547
Okay.
53.714
53.747
See you tonight.

Is that the supermodel?
57.014

57.047
Yep.
58.081

I do.
But it's 3:00.
64.081
64.114
I'm flying right back.
65.081
65.114
Then I'm gonna
meet Bridgette
66.381
66.414
at the Diplomat's club
in the airport.
68.047

68.081
Well, guess what
I'm doing?
69.247

I'm going to Mr. Pitt's,
70.714

and I am telling him
that I am quitting.

How about
the march-out?

Not as good.

That's when you realize
all the money you're losing.

Uh-huh.
96.547

to borrow your camera.
104.981
# JERRY

Why?
105.981
# GEORGE
106.014
Well, I wanna put a picture
107.047
107.081
of me and my boss, Mr. Morgan,
108.214
108.247
up in the office.
109.214

109.247
What for?

# GEORGE
110.447
Well, he's reorganizing
the whole staff,
112.214
112.247
and I'm on thin ice
with this guy as it is.

# JERRY
114.781
Isn't putting his picture
on your desk
116.814
116.847
a little transparent?

It better be.

130.914
Elaine, do you know
what I just did?
131.375
133.381
I've just amended my will
134.647
134.681
to include you as a beneficiary.
137.047
137.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
137.847
What?
138.981
# PITT
139.014
Well, I think of you
as part of my family.
140.914
140.947
You've come to be
like a daughter to me,
142.681
142.714
and I want to make sure
that you're taken care of
144.681
144.714
after I'm gone.

[COUGHS]
151.547
151.581
I feel a cold coming on.
153.214
153.247
Could you get me a cold pill
from the medicine cabinet?
155.514
155.547
No, Mr. Pitt.
You mustn't.
156.681
156.714
You have to check
with the pharmacy
158.181
158.214
before you mix any
of your medicine.
159.914
159.947
Yes, yes, I'll check
with the pharmacist.
161.375
162.281
We don't want anything
to happen to you, Mr. Pitt.
164.481
164.514
We want you to live
a long, long time.
166.547
166.950
**LOL**

GEORGE:
Look at that.
I only got one picture left.
171.081
171.914
Uh...
You know what?
172.914
172.947
How about a shot
of me and Mr. Morgan?
174.514
174.547
Why?
175.581
176.100
**LOL**
# PITT
176.614
Because we're a team.
Come on.
178.581
178.614
Would you take this
for us, dear?
180.014
180.047
Thank you very much.
Here we go.
181.447
184.081
Anyone ever tell you
185.047
185.081
you look a lot like
Sugar Ray Leonard?
186.881
186.914
Excuse me?
187.881
187.914
Yeah, you must hear
that all the time.
190.314
190.347
I suppose we all
look alike to you.
191.375
191.881
Right, Costanza?
What?
194.847
194.881
What?
No, no, no, no.
197.714
197.747
Not a racial thing.
198.714
198.747
There really is
a resemblance.
200.347
200.381
Don't you think
he looks like Sugar Ray?
204.747
202.800

Come on,
somebody.
206.014
206.047

208.047
Come on.
209.514
209.547
A little--
Little help.
211.247
212.881
Maybe he looks a little
like Sugar Ray Leonard.
215.147
215.181
A little?
Come on.
216.981
217.014
No, you still
shouldn't have said it.
218.747
219.150
**LOL**
218.781
You really think that Morgan
thinks I have a racial bias?
221.181
221.214
Maybe.
221.375
222.781
That is so unfair.
224.647
224.681
I would have marched on Selma
if it was in Long Island.
227.314
226.400
**LOL**
227.347
So you would have marched
on Great Neck?
229.014
229.047
Absolutely.
230.214
230.247
I still might.
231.581
231.614
I always hated those girls.
They would never date me.

there you are.

So, you ready?
For what?
238.481
238.514
He's taking me
to the airport.
239.847
239.881
No, we got
a few minutes.
240.981
241.014
Oh, okay.
242.547
242.581
What, you got
no luggage?
244.147
244.181
This is it.
245.181
245.200
**LOL**
245.214
I'm only going
for the day.
246.347
246.381
I just gotta stop
by the drugstore
247.814
247.847
and pick up
a toothbrush.
248.914
248.947
Okay.

Hey, Kramer, who does
that look like?

Come on, come on.
257.381

266.981
267.014
All right.
I'll tell you what.
268.714
268.747
I'll bet you the next
three people I ask,
270.581
270.614
two of them will say that
it looks like Sugar Ray.
272.647
272.681
How much?
273.647
273.681
Hundred dollars,
$200, $1000

Hey, wait a second.
What are you doing?
276.681
276.714
You're not betting.
277.714

You know he's not
supposed to bet.
279.181

Come on, Jerry,
it's a lock.
280.381

Kramer, you've had
this thing under control
281.375

for almost
three years now.

What are you gonna
do about Morgan?
292.381
292.414
You know what would be great?
293.714
293.747
If he could just see me
with some of my black friends.
296.081
296.114
Yeah, except you don't really
have any black friends.
298.581
297.000

And outside of us,
you don't really have
300.314
