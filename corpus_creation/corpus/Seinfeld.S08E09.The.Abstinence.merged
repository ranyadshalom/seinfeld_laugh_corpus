I always knew
that after I became a doctor,
1205.678
1205.711
I would dump whoever I was with
and find someone better.
1208.344

That's the dream of becoming
a doctor.

The Portuguese waitress?
1250.344
# GEORGE
1250.378
I calculated my odds
of ever getting together
1252.045
1253.411
with a Portuguese waitress.
1255.344
1255.378
Mathematically,
I had to do it, Jerry.

come down here for?

To tell you about
the Portuguese waitress.
