 There's my Chinese food.
12.215
12.385
I gotta run.
13.898
13.100

14.065
All you.
15.100
# GEORGE
15.265
 Who was it?
16.300
# JERRY
16.300
 I did a show for a car dealership.
17.335
17.505
 They're getting me a new Saab.
18.700
# GEORGE
18.700
 What about your old car?
19.894
20.065
 Couldn't get Kramer's blood out of it?
21.425
# JERRY
21.425
 No. The engine clotted.
22.784
22.945
You know who set
this whole thing up? Frank Merman.
25.300
# GEORGE
25.465
Fragile Frankie Merman?
26.864
27.000
**LOL**
27.745
 Never liked that guy.
28.780
# JERRY
28.780
 Why? He's harmless.
29.815
# GEORGE
29.985
Every summer, you guys
went to camp together.
32.135
32.305
I was jealous. It felt like
he was the summer me.
34.694
# JERRY
34.865
 He was not the summer you.
35.661
35.661
 Yeah.
36.457
36.625
Besides, you had a summer me.
38.456
37.150
**LOL**
38.625
Whitey Fisk, the guy who snuck you
into Last Tango in Paris.
41.776
# GEORGE
43.025
I made him up.
44.936
# JERRY
45.105
So you never saw
Last Tango in Paris?
47.255
# GEORGE
47.425
 No.
48.500
# JERRY
48.500
 Too bad, it was erotic.
49.575
51.250

# KRAMER
52.665
Well, I've had it
with these jack-booted thugs.
57.420
# JERRY
# KRAMER
57.905
Pottery Barn?
59.702
59.865
I got three Pottery Barn catalogues
in one day.
62.060
60.450
**LOL**
62.225
That makes eight this month.
64.534
# GEORGE
65.265
Mira Sorvino.
Think she'd go out with me?
67.825
69.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
69.825
Why don't you just throw them out?
71.497
# KRAMER
71.665
No. I've been saving them up
here in your apartment.
73.974
74.145
And now, it's payback time.
76.056
76.225
Pottery Barn is in for a world of hurt.
79.023
78.550
**LOL**
# JERRY
79.585
Can I have one?
81.337
81.825
I need one of those
old-looking phones.
84.055
85.585
So you wanna grab a bite?
86.620
86.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
86.785
I can't. I gotta make
the weekly call to the folks.
88.980
# JERRY
89.145
 So call now.
90.043
# GEORGE
90.043
 Gotta prep.
90.942
91.105
I need a couple of anecdotes,
a few you-were- right-abouts.
93.665
93.825
It's a whole procedure.
94.860
95.265
Wasn't Fragile Frankie the one
that used to run to the woods...
97.938
98.105
 ... every time he got upset?
98.964
# JERRY
98.964
 That's him.
99.823
# GEORGE
100.305
 He still nuts?
101.061
# JERRY
101.061
 What do you think?
101.818
101.985
They gave me a new car
for 30 minutes of:
103.703
103.865
"So who's from out of town?"
105.662
108.250

Delish. You know,
short for delicious.

119.265
Oh, like scrump.

Can I borrow your ketchup?

154.000
**LOL**

Sorry, George, our Chinese food
just came. Talk to you later.

Hey, you like sending out catalogues?
How do you like getting them back?

# JERRY
185.985
So maybe they had Chinese food.
187.737
187.150
**LOL**
# GEORGE
187.905
After dark?
188.894
189.065
Please. At their age
that's like swallowing stun grenades.

# JERRY
193.305
Well, there's one way to check.
Where there's Chinese food...
195.944
196.105
...there's leftovers.

# ELAINE
209.025
Hey, hey, hey. I met this guy.
And it was like this...
213.337
213.825
...totally unreal fairy-tale moment.
217.022
# JERRY
217.185
It wasn't Whitey Fisk, was it?
218.777
# ELAINE
219.825
Oh, George's friend?
What happened to him?
221.816
# GEORGE
222.545
Nothing. I don't know. I gotta go.
225.184
226.650

226.425
So this is beautiful.
227.540
227.705
You and Puddy and this new guy
in a big pot of love stew.
231.664
# ELAINE
232.785
Yeah. Puddy.
235.219
235.865
Well, I won't fire him
until I see if this new guy...
240.177
240.100
**LOL**
240.345
...can handle the workload.
242.779
# KRAMER

Will you look at this?
More catalogues.
246.975
247.145
Omaha Steaks, MacWarehouse.
Newsweek?

250.900
**LOL**
250.665
I can't stop all these companies...
252.178
252.345

at the choke point.

# FRANKIE
270.043
 It is the van.
271.101
271.905
Don't you remember, we always
talked about how cool it would be...
274.783
274.945
...to have a van and just drive.
276.697
# JERRY
277.225
We were 10.

280.863
# JERRY

I don't want a van.
283.383
# ELAINE
283.545
Just tell him you want the Saab.
285.137
# JERRY
285.305
You don't understand.
This is Fragile Frankie Merman.
287.580
287.745
When we were in camp,
if you upset him...
289.497
289.665
...he'd run into the woods,
dig a hole, and sit in it.
292.054
# ELAINE
292.865
Well, I have an idea.
294.218
294.385
Keep the van and just get
a bumper sticker that says:
297.422
297.585
"If this van's a-rocking,
don't come a-knocking."
301.419

backing up.

 No, that's us.
377.345
# JERRY
377.345
 Great.
378.625
378.785
You know, Frankie, I was wondering.
381.424
381.585
What if I decided that it's silly
to have a van because, you know...
386.295
386.465
...I live in New York City.
388.342
389.985
Is there maybe some way
I could exchange it?
392.340
# FRANKIE
392.905
 You don't like the van?
394.384
# JERRY
394.384
 No, no, no. It's just hypothetically.
395.863
# FRANKIE
396.465
 I gotta go to the park.
397.380
# JERRY
397.380
 No. No, you don't.

398.465
No woods.

get by these bricks.

I'm gonna try and sell
the van to a lot.

# KRAMER
421.625
A dealer? Are you insane?
No, take out an ad. Sell it privately.

I don't think I wanna meet the people
that are in the market for a used van.

Here we go. Yeah.
436.223
436.385
So for sale, huh?
438.580
438.745
For sale.
440.064
440.225
A big juicy van.
443.979
445.905
And, oh, we gotta put down,
"interesting trades considered."

 The bank.

E-mail, telephones, fax machines,

What, you think you're so clever,
figuring that one out?
522.259

609.664
# JERRY
609.825
Oh, no, George. Please.
What are you gonna do?
612.544
# GEORGE
612.705
You remember my cousin, Rhisa?
615.094
615.600
**LOL**
615.425
 I'm gonna date her.
616.620
# JERRY
616.620
 Mother of God.
617.814
# GEORGE
617.985
One little wink. She'll freak out,
tell my parents. They'll be all over me.
621.978
623.105
What is this tape?
624.220
# JERRY
624.385
That guy Elaine's dating
seems really familiar to me.
626.774
626.945
I think he might be a comedian
I worked with one time.
630.142
627.550
**LOL**
630.465
Wait a second. What...?
What, what is this?
632.695
632.865
This week end
Nobody Beats The Wiz...
634.696
634.865
... is slashing prices
on our entire stock.
637.425
637.585
Nobody beats me
because I'm the Wiz.
640.383
640.545
Yes. I'm the Wiz. I'm the Wiz.
643.537
# JERRY
646.305
That is the guy.
647.579
647.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
647.745
Elaine's in love with the Wiz guy?
649.337
# JERRY
649.505
She thinks she's in love with him.
651.097
651.265
She's just remembering
this old commercial.
653.142
# GEORGE
653.305
 That's pretty pathetic.
655.245
# JERRY
655.245
 I know. They're not even related.
657.184
# ELAINE
658.025
Hey.
659.140
660.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
661.065
 I'm gonna get going.
662.282
# JERRY
662.282
 Have fun at the family reunion.
663.499
666.625
So, what do you know
about this Jack fella?
669.981
# ELAINE
670.145
 Isn't he the best?
671.744
# JERRY
671.744
 Yeah, nobody beats him.
673.342
673.505
Yeah.
674.779
675.505
What kind of work does he do?
676.858
# ELAINE
677.025
Oh, right now he's a fact-checker
for New York Magazine.
680.222
680.785
It's not much, but it has a certain kind
of quiet dignity.
685.017
# JERRY
686.785
Right. Quiet dignity.
688.935
689.105
As opposed to, say...
691.255
691.250
**LOL**
691.425
...this.
692.460
692.625
Nobody beats me
because I'm the Wiz.
695.583
# ELAINE
695.745
 Oh, no.
697.264
# JERRY
697.264
 Oh, yes.
698.782
701.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
701.185
Hello?
702.220
702.385
Yeah, the van is still for sale.
Sure, come on by.
705.502
# KRAMER
706.745
Yeah, I called about the van.
708.303
# GEORGE
711.625
 Some more merlot?
712.324
# RHISA
712.324
 Yeah, thanks.
713.024
713.150
**LOL**
# GEORGE
713.185
Sure.
714.538
716.985
You know, Rhisa, l...
718.464
721.065
I've always found you
very attractive.
723.340
# RHISA
724.305
What?
725.818
# GEORGE
726.225
I know it may sound shocking...
729.456
726.900
**LOL**
729.625
...but I just can't stop myself
from wanting you.
734.301
# RHISA
734.465
You wanna borrow money, right?
736.376
737.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
736.705
No, no. L... I just want us to be...
740.380
740.585
...together.
741.654
# RHISA
741.825
All right.
743.338
# GEORGE
744.825
 All right?
745.940
# RHISA
745.940
 Let's go for it.
747.055
# GEORGE
747.225
Well, we could dance around it
a little first.
750.535
# RHISA
750.705
No. Let's be bad, George.
752.900
753.065
 Let's be really bad.
754.299
# GEORGE
754.299
 Whoa, easy.
755.533
# KRAMER
759.385
 So how come you're selling it?
761.461
# JERRY
761.461
 You know why I'm selling it. I hate it.
763.537
# KRAMER
763.705
 How many miles?
764.683
# JERRY
764.683
 Two.
765.661
766.100
**LOL**
# KRAMER
766.265
City or highway?
767.334
# JERRY
767.505
Look, do you really wanna buy
this thing or what?
769.655
# KRAMER
769.825
Hey, hey. Take it easy.
I'm not gonna be pressured.
772.214
772.385
I'll walk away right now.
773.659
775.545
Is this thing bent?
777.661
780.945
 I'm not paying for that.
782.179
# JERRY
782.179
 All right, just get out of here.
783.413
# KRAMER
783.585
All right. Look, I'm gonna be honest.
785.541
785.705
I'm very interested in the van.
787.900
# JERRY
788.065
Okay, fine. What do I have to do
to put you in this van today?
792.377
# KRAMER
792.545
Well, I don't really have any money,
but it says right here:
795.423
795.585
Interesting trades considered?
797.177
796.350
**LOL**
# JERRY
797.345
 You put that in.
798.801
# KRAMER
798.801
 Glad I did.
800.257
800.425
Here.
801.983
# JERRY
802.225
You wanna trade me an undershirt?
803.897
# KRAMER
804.065
No, I want to trade you screen legend
Anthony Quinn's undershirt.
808.024
808.185
He took this off to do sit-ups
in the park and I nabbed it.
811.734
# JERRY
812.225
 That's disgusting.
814.182
# KRAMER
814.182
 Well, that's my final offer.
816.138
# PUDDY
818.385
You dumped me for some idiotic
TV pitchman?
821.183
# ELAINE
821.945
I'm sorry, Puddy. It was a mistake.
824.539
824.705
Let's just put it behind us...
826.536
826.705
...and we can continue
as if this never happened.
829.822
# PUDDY
829.985
Jeez, I don't know.
What if we're out somewhere...
832.055
832.225
...and you see
the Maytag Repairman?
834.455
# ELAINE
835.865
 You're not taking me back?
837.225
# PUDDY
837.225
 That's right.
838.584
# ELAINE
839.265
He's not idiotic.
840.664
840.825
He's the Wiz.
And nobody beats him.
844.101
844.050
**LOL**
845.185
Nobody.
846.903
# KRAMER
848.745
Here you go. Mail is evil. Pass it on.
850.337
851.625
Hey, mail blows. Fax it to a friend.
853.820
# WOMAN
854.305
Why does this dummy have a bucket
on his head?
856.375
# KRAMER
856.545
Because we're blind to their tyranny.
858.615
# WOMAN
858.785
Shouldn't you
be wearing the bucket?
860.377
# KRAMER
860.945
Yeah. Move along, Betty.
862.378
# FRANKIE
864.465
Is this Jerry Seinfeld's van?
866.217
# KRAMER
867.105
Not anymore. He traded it to me
for some Hollywood memorabilia.
870.734
868.000
**LOL**
# FRANKIE
871.985
 I'm so stupid.
872.781
# KRAMER

 What?
873.577

873.745
I'm so stupid. Excuse... I'm sorry.

877.185
Hey, nice to meet you.
878.584
878.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
880.545
She's into it?
882.137
# GEORGE
882.305
She's leaving me dirty messages
on my answering machine.
884.944
# JERRY
886.105
So have your parents
found out about it?
888.141
# GEORGE
888.305
She wants to keep it quiet. She thinks
we have a real future together.
891.263
# JERRY
891.425
It's a brave new world, all right.
893.017
# KRAMER
894.865
Hey, guys.

896.945
Hey, how's the anti-mail
campaign going?
898.617
898.350
**LOL**
# KRAMER
898.785
Oh, boy, it's fantastic. We were out
in front of the post office today...
902.095
902.265
...and not one person went in.
903.903
# JERRY
904.065
It's Sunday.
905.464
# GEORGE
907.265
Why is the mailman
wearing a bucket?
909.017
# KRAMER
910.305
Well, it symbolizes our persecution.
912.614
912.550
**LOL**
# GEORGE
912.785
Shouldn't you be
wearing the bucket?
914.423
# JERRY
916.025
Hey, I want my van keys back.
917.822
# KRAMER
917.985
Well, I thought we made a deal
for Quinn's T-shirt?
921.660
# JERRY
921.825
Are you insane?
923.099
923.585
 Give them.
924.302
# KRAMER
924.302
 No, I can't. I can't.
925.018
925.185
See, I told Frank he could borrow it.
926.777
927.150
**LOL**
926.945
Yeah, he wants to move some
of George's stuff into storage.
929.505
# GEORGE
930.145
Wait a minute.
931.498
931.665
He's picking up the van tonight?
This is perfect.
933.974
934.145
I'll drive Rhisa
to someplace romantic...
935.976
936.145
...then when my father slides
the door open...
938.056
938.225
...l'm in the van
kissing his brother's daughter.
941.342
# KRAMER
941.985
Jerry, one of your friends came by...
943.623
942.950
**LOL**
943.785
...and he was very upset
that I had your wheels.
945.821
# JERRY
945.985
Oh, no, not Frankie.
947.100
# KRAMER
947.265
I didn't catch his name,
but he went running into the park.
949.984
# JERRY

Oh, no, the woods, the hole.

960.020
# KRAMER
960.185
I know, I'm gonna switch the bucket
to something else.
962.904
# NEWMAN
963.065
 Not that.
964.123
# KRAMER
964.123
 What?
965.181
# NEWMAN
965.345
You're in trouble, Kramer.
966.460
966.625
I shouldn't be talking to you.
I'm telling you as a friend.
969.139
969.305
Here's how it's gonna happen.
970.533
970.705
You may be walking, maybe on
a crisp autumn day just like today...
973.742
973.905
...when a mail truck will slow
beside you, the door will open.
976.544
976.705
A mailman you know, maybe even
trust, will offer to give you a lift.
979.902
979.300
**LOL**
# KRAMER
980.065
 Are you through?
980.742
# NEWMAN
980.742
 No.
981.418
981.585
And no one will ever see you again.
983.223
# KRAMER
983.385
 Are you through?
984.380
# NEWMAN
984.380
 Yes.
985.376
985.545
No, wait.
987.024
987.185
Okay, yes.

# NEWMAN
993.825
 Quick. Get in.
994.940
# KRAMER
994.940
 Oh, no, no, no.
996.055
996.225
That's exactly how you said
it was going down.
998.420
# NEWMAN
998.585
There's another way.
It's going down now!
1000.223
# KRAMER
1000.385
No, you said a mailman I know,
and you're a mailman I know.
1003.980
1000.900

 Wait. What's he saying?
1056.042
# GEORGE

 I think he's saying Son of Sam.

# RHISA
1058.341

 But I'm keeping it.

1105.785
As much as I hate the idea
of being a van guy...
