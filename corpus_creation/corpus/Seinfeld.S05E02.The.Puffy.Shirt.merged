There's no way that
moving in with your parents,

is a sign that your life
is right on track.

"In the opinion of the board,

And you go back
into that little room of yours,

you feel so huge,

it's like you can take your bed

You're done.

And here's your check.
1148.503
1148.536
Thank you very much.
1149.803

It was an honor.

Oh.

# WOMAN
1165.103
You know, I was wondering,
1166.569
1166.603
if you're not doing
anything later,
1168.403
1168.436
maybe you'd
like to get together.
1170.503
1172.900
**LOL**

Whoo-hoo-hoo!

You ruined me,
you ruined my career!

# JERRY
1184.769
Just keep your voice down.
Everyone can hear you.
1185.705
# LESLIE
1187.436
I don't give a damn!
1189.003
# JERRY
1189.036
You know, if you talked
this loud to begin with,
1191.003
1191.036
I wouldn't be in this costume
in the first place.
1193.069
# GEORGE
1193.103
Hey, hey, you can't
believe this.
1194.536
1194.569
Look at this check.
They told me I had
1196.136
1196.169
the most beautiful hands
they've ever seen in their life,
1198.569
1198.603
except for this McKigney guy.
1199.869
1199.903
This great-looking girl
gave me her phone number.
1202.036
1202.069
I got it all!
I'm busting, Jerry. I'm busting!
1204.636
# ELAINE
1204.669
Hey, I've never noticed
your hands before, let me see.
1206.969
1207.003
All right.
1208.336
# GEORGE
# ELAINE
1210.269
Yeah. Real nice.
1211.369
1212.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1216.269
Nice shirt.
1217.269
1219.403
Wh-what is this?
1221.036
1221.069
Is this what you wore
on the show?
1222.469
# JERRY
1222.503
Yeah.
1223.469
# GEORGE
1223.503
Have you completely
lost your mind?
1225.736
# KRAMER
# GEORGE
1225.769
Who's dressing you?
1227.536
1226.300
**LOL**
1227.569
You look like
a complete idiot.
1230.036
1230.069
I wouldn't wipe my
1231.603
1232.800
**LOL**
1232.403
Aah!

ELAINE:
I'm sorry.
1250.703
# GEORGE
1250.736
This McKigney guy had
a few good years.
1253.903
1253.936
How could you forget
to turn off an iron?
1256.169
# KRAMER
1256.203
I was excited because Jerry
was putting on the puffy shirt.
1258.903
# GEORGE
1258.936
My whole life is ruined
because of the puffy shirt.
1261.669
# JERRY
1261.703
It didn't do
me any good either.
1263.236
1262.450
**LOL**
1263.269
That benefit was the worst show
I ever did.
1265.869
1265.903
Some of those heckles
were really uncalled-for.
1268.369
1268.403
"Avast ye, matey"?
1269.836
1269.869
What the hell
does that mean?
1271.869
1271.700
**LOL**
1271.903
"Twenty degrees over
the starboard side,
1273.669
1273.703
it's a Spanish galleon."
1274.869
1274.903
There's no comeback
for that.
1275.705
# ELAINE
1277.103
Well, it got me fired
from the benefit committee.
1280.736
# KRAMER
1280.769
You know, all those stores
canceled out on her.
1283.836
1283.869
She's finished.
1285.003
1285.036
We're finished.
1286.369
# JERRY
1286.403
Really?
What happened?
1288.003
# KRAMER
1288.036
I just can't be with someone,
1289.369
1289.403
whose life is in
complete disarray.
1292.369
1292.250
**LOL**
# JERRY
1294.336
What happened to
all the shirts?
1295.803
# KRAMER
1295.836
They gave them
to Goodwill.
1297.003
1298.100

# HOMELESSMAN

GEORGE:
Puffy shirt, puffy shirt!
1301.836
1306.336
Can you spare a little change,
for an old buccaneer?
1310.103
# JERRY
1312.003
You know, it's really not
a bad-looking shirt.
1313.969
1314.003
[â™ª]
1316.669
1315.000
**LOL**
1324.669
Why do we always
have to say "excuse me,"
1329.303
1328.000
**LOL**
1329.336
when we can't hear
what someone is saying?
1331.669
1331.703
Why are we so guilty?
1333.636
1333.669
"Excuse me. Pardon me.
I'm sorry."
1336.536
1336.569
Why can't just once, I go,
1338.236
1338.269
"Nope. Not loud enough"?
1340.303
1340.400
**LOL**
1340.336
Why can't I do that?
1342.003
1342.036
[â™ª]
1344.336
1344.369
Just once I would like to have
the guts,
1347.336
1347.369
you know, to make that judgment.
1349.503
1349.536
Someone mumbles something
and you go,
1351.169
1351.203
"Your fault."
1352.803
1367.800
**LOL**
