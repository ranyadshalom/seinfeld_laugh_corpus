With a serial killer loose,
1.902
1.935
seems like the safest thing
is to be the neighbor.
4.636
2.750
**LOL**
4.669
They never kill
the neighbor.
5.936
5.969
The neighbor always survives
7.169
7.400
**LOL**
7.203
to do the interview
afterwards, right?
9.203
9.236
"Uh, he was kind of quiet."
10.969
11.003
I love these neighbors.
12.303
12.336
They're never disturbed
by the sounds of murdering.
14.536
14.569
Just stereo.
15.669
15.703
Chain saws,
people screaming, fine.
17.703
16.450
**LOL**
17.736
Just keep the music down.
20.336
19.250
**LOL**
20.369
And all these women that always
fall in love with the killer.
23.003
23.036
They write to him in prison.
24.336
24.369
Here's a woman
that's hard to disappoint.
26.803
25.450
**LOL**
26.836
I guess she's only upset
when she finds out
28.803
# JERRY
28.836
he's stopped
killing people.
30.000
30.336
And she goes,
"You know, sometimes I feel like
32.469
32.503
I don't even know
who you are anymore."

JERRY [ON PHONE]:
Eight years
isn't such a long streak.
43.891
# ELAINE
43.925
It isn't?
44.958
# JERRY
44.991
No. I haven't vomited
in 13 years.
47.458
46.750
**LOL**
# ELAINE
47.491
Get out!
49.958
# JERRY
49.991
Not since June 29, 1980.
52.925
# ELAINE
52.958
You remember the date?
54.891
# JERRY
54.925
Yes. Because my previous
vomit was also June 29, 1972.
60.991
61.025
That's why during
the '80 vomit,
63.291
63.550
**LOL**
63.325
I was yelling to George,
64.958
64.991
"Can you believe it?
66.158
66.191
I'm vomiting
on June 29th again."
66.578
67.550
**LOL**
# ELAINE
69.258
Boy, you know, when Joel told me
he hadn't thrown up
71.391
71.425
in eight years,
72.658
72.691
I was wondering
if he was normal.
74.391
# JERRY
74.425
No, Elaine, he's normal.
75.625
75.658
Your boyfriend
is a normal guy.
77.058
77.091
He just has the same name as one
of the worst serial killers
79.825
79.858
in the history of New York.
80.958
81.250
**LOL**
# ELAINE
80.991
Yeah.
82.391
82.425
Oh, Jer,
I got to go.
85.125
# JOANNE
85.158
Hi.
Hey.
86.258
86.291
We just saw your boyfriend
at a bus stop.
88.825
# ELAINE
88.858
Oh, yeah?
89.825
# JOANNE
89.858
Yeah. What's his name?
91.391
# ELAINE
91.425
Joel.
92.391
# JOANNE
92.425
Joel what?
93.458
# ELAINE
93.491
Uh, Rifkin.
95.091
95.350
**LOL**
# MICHAEL
95.125
Rifkin?
96.558
96.591
Joel Rifkin?
97.558
# ELAINE
97.591
Yeah. It's just
a coincidence,
99.558
99.591
obviously.
100.658
# MICHAEL
100.691
Guess you better keep
on his good side.
102.958
102.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
102.991
Very funny.
That's very funny.
105.758
# JOANNE
105.791
Yeah, I wouldn't sleep
with my back to him
107.891
107.925
if I were you.
109.325
108.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
109.358
Yeah. Well, that's
enough of that.
111.658
# MICHAEL
111.691
Elaine, listen,
if you smell anything
113.325
113.358
decaying in the trunk
of his car
114.958
# ELAINE
114.991
Look, this is my boyfriend
we're talking about!
116.991
116.300
**LOL**
117.025
He's a gentleman,
he's good-looking,
118.658
118.691
he's a good shaver
119.958
119.991
and he hasn't thrown up
in eight years.
121.725
121.900
**LOL**
121.758
So just shut up about him.
122.925
122.958
Shut up!
123.991
# ELAINE
127.191
The whole city
is talking
128.391
128.425
about this monster,
Joel Rifkin.
130.058
130.091
And I am dating
a Joel Rifkin.
132.125
# JERRY
132.158
But you like
your Joel Rifkin.
133.491
# ELAINE
133.525
Yeah. I just wish he had
a different name.
136.925
# JERRY
136.958
Ask him
to change it.
138.458
138.250
**LOL**
# ELAINE
138.491
You can't ask a person
to change their name.
141.325
# JERRY
141.358
Why not?
142.325
# ELAINE
142.358
Would you
change yours?
144.058
# JERRY
144.091
If someone asked me nicely.
145.625
145.750
**LOL**
146.791
I'm Claude Seinfeld.
148.491
149.700
**LOL**
# ELAINE
149.958
Hey, how many people
did Rifkin strangle, 18?
152.791
# JERRY
152.825
Yeah,
18 strangles.
154.291
# KRAMER
154.325
Well, you know why Rifkin
was a serial killer?
156.578
156.625
Because he was adopted.
157.825
158.350
**LOL**
160.491
Just like Son of Sam
was adopted.
162.725
162.758
So apparently,
163.725
163.758
adoption leads
to serial killing.
165.825
164.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
169.491
You know, Joel and I have an
extra ticket to the Giants game.
172.491
# KRAMER
172.525
I'll go.
Okay.
173.525
173.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
174.991
I'll leave a ticket for you
at will call.
176.758
# KRAMER
176.791
Yeah! Ooh!
178.291
# ELAINE
180.025
You think I should have
asked George?
183.125
# JERRY
183.158
Hey, did you hear George
got back with Karen?
185.291
# ELAINE
185.325
Karen?
186.578
# JERRY
186.625
Risotto.
187.558
# ELAINE
187.591
I feel full
after the risotto.
189.758
189.600
**LOL**
189.791
Oh, the risotto broad.
192.258
# JERRY
192.291
Yeah.
193.491
193.525
He's really got
a good thing with her.
195.125
195.158
In fact, I'm doubling
with them tonight.
196.925
# ELAINE
196.958
Thought you didn't like
double dates.
198.591
# JERRY
198.625
George likes them. He feels it's
a good personality showcase.
201.558
201.950
**LOL**
201.591
He likes a date to see him
with a friend,
204.225
204.258
so she can get a window
into his non-date personality.
206.791
206.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
206.825
I've looked
through that window
208.591
208.625
and screamed at him
to shut the blinds.
210.791
210.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
212.791
He feels he's funnier,
more relaxed.
214.991
213.750
**LOL**
# ELAINE
215.025
Uh-huh. And you're taking?
216.558
# JERRY
216.591
Jodi, the masseuse.
217.758
# ELAINE
217.791
Oh, did you get
a massage yet?
219.091
# JERRY
219.125
No. How many times
do I have to go out with her,
221.125
221.158
before I get a massage?
222.758
222.650
**LOL**
# ELAINE
222.791
Jerry, she gives
massages all day.
225.758
225.791
She doesn't want
to give them on dates.
227.425
# JERRY
227.458
Yeah, I know.
She just wants to have sex.
230.891
229.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
230.925
So what?
232.391
# JERRY
232.425
So it's like going to Idaho
and eating carrots.
235.225
234.950
**LOL**
235.258
I like carrots,
but I'm in Idaho,
237.158
237.191
I want a potato.
239.491
# GEORGE
242.091
So I go into
this clothing store,
243.458
243.491
and the saleswoman
is wearing this, uh...
245.258
245.291
[WHISTLES]
246.258
246.291
Low-cut thing.
246.578
247.591
So I said to her,
"Can I ask you a question?
250.125
250.158
"When you put on
a top like that,
252.291
252.325
"what's your
thought process?
254.158
254.191
What's going on
in your mind?"
256.558
# KAREN
256.591
Oh, that is so funny.
258.491
260.650
**LOL**
# GEORGE
260.658
You listening to this?
261.825
# JODI
261.858
Yeah,
I heard you.
263.825
263.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
263.858
Boy, my neck
is killing me.
265.958
265.991
It's, like, right
in this spot.
268.225
268.258
Very tender
over here.
269.658
# JODI
269.691
So, what did
she say?
271.425
# GEORGE
271.458
Well, nothing.
I didn't actually say that.
274.858
# JODI
275.991
You just said
that you said it.
276.578
# GEORGE
277.525
Sweetheart,
I was exaggerating.
280.325
# KAREN
280.358
I'm learning a lot
about you tonight, George.
282.925
282.958
I've never seen
you like this.
284.991
# JERRY
286.458
It's like somebody's pulling
on wires back here.
288.825
288.850
**LOL**
# GEORGE
288.858
You know, it's like you never
see a really attractive woman
293.391
293.425
getting a traffic ticket.
295.158
# JODI
295.191
How can
you say that?
296.658
296.691
My sister got
a ticket last week.
298.825
298.858
Are you saying
she's not attractive?
301.591
# GEORGE
301.625
Well, I've never met
your sister.
303.058
303.091
But obviously, these are not
hard-and-fast rules.
305.258
305.650
**LOL**
305.291
Darling, the tea is getting
a little cold, sweetheart.
306.578

Can we go?
Yeah, let's go.
309.058

# KAREN
# JODI
312.458
Nice meeting you, Karen.
313.458
# KAREN
313.491
Nice to meet you too.
314.591
314.625
I'm gonna
call you about that massage.
316.258
# JODI
# GEORGE
316.291
Jodi, let's do this again
real soon.
317.791

# JODI
317.825
Yeah.
318.991
318.350
**LOL**
# JERRY
322.291
I strained my neck
last night.
325.125
# JODI
325.158
Really?
Yeah.
326.291
325.750
**LOL**
326.325
How?
327.391
# JERRY
327.425
Well, I tried
brushing my teeth
328.991
329.025
by holding the brush
330.091
330.125
and moving my head
from side to side.
331.791
331.300
**LOL**
331.825
It didn't work.
333.958
# JODI
333.991
So, what's the deal
with your friend, George?
336.578
# JERRY
337.858
No deal, why?
339.091
# JODI
339.125
What was all that
"attractive women
341.658
341.691
not getting tickets"
nonsense?
343.225
# JERRY
343.258
Oh, well, he was
just showcasing
344.791
344.825
his non-date
personality.
346.425
# JODI
346.458
I don't know how you
can hang out with that guy.
349.291
# JERRY
349.325
Yeah, sometimes it really
makes me tense.
352.658
351.600
**LOL**
# JODI
352.691
Did you see the way
that he was eating?
356.425
# JERRY
356.458
Yeah,
he's disgusting.
358.225
358.250
**LOL**
# JODI
358.258
I have to tell you,
360.091
360.125
I really
don't like him.
361.925
# JERRY
361.958
Yeah, me either.
363.091
# JODI
363.125
It's just
I hate that type.
364.991
# JERRY
365.025
Ah, he's a bad seed.
366.158
367.000
**LOL**
# JODI
367.991
Now, you, however,
370.158
370.191
you, I like.
372.258
# JERRY
372.291
Uh, what are you doing?
374.591
# JODI
374.625
What do you think
I'm doing?
376.291
376.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
379.925
So, what do you think?
381.258
# KAREN
381.291
Really enjoyed it.
383.425
# GEORGE
383.458
Jodi's nice.
384.425
# KAREN
384.458
She's very nice.
386.091
386.125
Let's discuss
this later.
388.325
# GEORGE
388.358
You think she liked me?
She seemed to like me.
390.258
390.291
Mm-hm.
391.291
# KAREN
# GEORGE
391.325
I was personable,
don't you think?
393.425
# KAREN
393.458
You were extremely
personable.
396.578
# GEORGE
396.991
'Cause I thought I picked up
a little something.
399.591
399.350
**LOL**
399.625
I'm very good at this.
401.325
401.358
Did you pick up anything?
402.925
# KAREN
402.958
I didn't pick up anything.
404.391
# GEORGE
404.425
The second time I sent
the noodles back...
407.191
407.400
**LOL**
409.091
I-- I thought
she made a face.
410.558
# KAREN
410.591
I didn't see a face.
412.458
# GEORGE
413.625
I thought
I saw a face.
415.458
# KAREN
415.491
Anyhow, what's
the difference?
416.958
# GEORGE
416.991
No difference.
I could care less.
418.725
418.758
She's Jerry's girlfriend.
419.925
# KAREN
419.958
George, instead of
talking about this,
422.591
422.625
we could be, uh...
423.591
423.625
You know.
424.891
424.925
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
426.225
# GEORGE
# KAREN
# GEORGE
426.258
So you think
she liked me?
426.578
428.400
**LOL**
434.625
Ohh!
435.658
# ELAINE
436.791
What are you doing?
437.825
# JOEL
437.858
Massaging your neck.
439.758
# ELAINE
439.791
Oh, heh.
441.958
443.158
Of course.
444.491
444.525
Massaging.
446.258
# JOEL
446.291
Uh, boning up
on football?
448.425
# ELAINE
448.458
Yeah. Yeah.
You know what?
450.958
450.991
There are a lot of players
named Deion these days.
454.225
454.300
**LOL**
454.258
What a cool name, Deion.
456.578
458.191
If I were going to
change my name,
459.591
459.625
I'd go with Deion.
460.658
# JOEL
460.691
Deion Benes?
462.891
# ELAINE
462.925
Well, as a woman,
it makes no sense.
466.658
465.850
**LOL**
466.691
But, I mean, well,
let's say I was you.
469.825
469.858
And I decided I was gonna
change my name,
472.291
472.325
for no real reason
whatsoever.
474.458
474.491
Deion Rifkin.
476.691
477.858
Wow!
That is so cool.
482.158
479.500
**LOL**
# JOEL
482.191
D-Deion Rifkin?
485.058
# ELAINE
485.091
Well, maybe you're
not the Deion type.
486.578
487.491
Okay then, let's see,

I got to tell you,
I have a bad association

# JOEL
1014.458
Bad association?

1016.158
Yeah. In college,
I sat next to an Alex
1019.091
1019.125
in art history.
1020.091
1020.125
And he was always
drinking coffee,
1021.725
1021.758
and after every sip,
he would go, "Ahh!"
1026.325
1025.850
**LOL**
1026.358
I mean, every two seconds,
"Ahh!"
1027.055
1029.125
And he would take,
like, 40 sips,
1030.925
1030.958
and after every one,
"Ahh!"
1033.591
1033.625
I had to drop the class.
