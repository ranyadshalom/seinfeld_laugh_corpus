Boy, look at this.
Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw.
131.024
131.197
I thought those would be perfect
for New York.
133.392
# JERRY

She's at that annual

187.253
If you do dance,
the cooks wanna know,
189.517

They made me buy it.
A hundred bucks, this thing cost me.
259.283
259.459
How dare they.
260.983
261.160
I got news for you. If it wasn't

# JERRY
290.070
I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo.

No.
311.943

There was this guy
and we had a few too many.
318.815
# GEORGE
318.985
You went home with him?
319.816
# ELAINE
319.816

you're dating.
353.248
# ELAINE
353.419
Oh, right.
355.910
356.089
Because if we're dating,
what everyone saw was just...
358.922
359.092
...a beautiful moment
between two lovers.
362.584
# JERRY
362.762
As opposed to a spirited bout

Yes, it can.

552.444
552.618
...hard-working, homeless gentlemen,
like yourselves, to pull rickshaws.

Now, I don't care where you're from,

Besides, it's not stealing
if it's something you need.

Well, the rickshaw's gone.

We strapped it to a homeless guy
and he bolted.
746.975

Well, you know, 85 percent of all

# KRAMER
754.420
We should've got
some collateral from him.
756.354
756.522
Like his bag of cans,

We gotta find that rickshaw.
You check the sewers and dumpsters.

So even though you're not really
going out with this guy, he's...
777.008
777.176
...cheating on you.
778.473
# ELAINE
778.473
That is correct.
779.770
779.945
But here's the beauty part.
781.674
781.847
Now, I stand up for myself by telling
everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass...

928.489
928.000
**LOL**
928.661
...filled his head with pseudo-erotic
tales of my own opium excursions.

Plus, I gave him
phone numbers of places...
935.800
935.650

Look, Mr. Peterman...
940.169
940.339
...the fact is, is that I was planning
