'cause I'm "night guy."

screws morning guy.

26.900
26.933
is try and oversleep
often enough

I don't like 'em.
They pinch my nose.

1086.054
1086.087

I don't know.
You're acting very mysteriously.
1130.421
# JERRY
1130.454
Well, I'm very mysterious
by nature.

A lot of women find

He loves
nature.

1159.621
Botany, zoology.
1161.521
1161.554
You know, his botany teacher
from college
1163.687
1163.721
stays in close touch
with him.
1165.254
1165.050

# JERRY
1191.421
I thought
you'd like that.
1192.887

Oh, so that's why you've been
acting so mysteriously.
1196.154
# JERRY
1196.187
Now you know.
1197.221

That, and that alone,
is the reason.

to give you a message.

He said that, uh,
he's very sorry,
1220.021
1220.054
and, uh, he hopes
you'll forgive him.

What are you talking about?
I don't know Jeffrey.
1230.054
1230.087
Oh, so this is why
you brought me up here.
1232.521
# JERRY
1232.554
Very convincing,
1233.628
1234.087
but it's not gonna
work this time.
1235.687
# UNCLELEO
1235.721
What are you
talking about?
1237.521
1237.554
All he meant was
that he was sorry
1239.221
1239.254
that the seats
aren't very good.
1241.587
# JERRY
1244.054

when did glasses
1322.254

go from being this carefully
crafted medical apparatus

to just this mall impulse item?

"Well, here's 72.
It's about 75, okay?"
