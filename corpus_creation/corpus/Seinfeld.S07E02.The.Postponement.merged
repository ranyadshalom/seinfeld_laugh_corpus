 Hey.
10.087
10.087
 Hey.
10.876
10.948
Big news. The dog problem
has been solved.
14.583
# JERRY
14.660
Really? What happened?
15.791
# ELAINE
15.870
Well, there's this rabbi
in my building...
17.963
18.039
You've met him.
He's a very nice man.
20.096
# JERRY
20.166
 Is he the one with the show on cable?
21.716
# ELAINE
21.716
 Yeah, yeah, that's the one.
23.267
23.336
So I spoke to him about the dog,
he went down, talked to the owner...
26.805
26.882
and she agreed to keep the dog
inside from now on.
29.555
# JERRY
29.635
 That's great.
30.954
# ELAINE
30.954
 I know.
32.273
38.550
**LOL**
# JERRY
48.155
 That looks pretty good.
49.765
# ELAINE
49.765
 He's in.
51.375
# JERRY
53.869
Hey, so, you know, we haven't
discussed George's engagement.
56.639
57.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
56.706
 What's to discuss?
58.340
# JERRY
58.340
 Come on. George is getting married.
59.973
# ELAINE
60.043
Is he happy?
61.388
# GEORGE
62.253
I will never understand
the bathrooms in this country.
64.845
64.923
Why is it that the stall doors do not
come all the way down to the floor?
68.807
# SUSAN
68.885
Maybe it's so you can see
if there's someone in there.
71.821
# GEORGE
72.014
Isn't that why we have locks
on the doors?
73.941
74.400
**LOL**
# SUSAN
74.016
Well, as a backup system,
in case the lock is broken...
76.987
77.061
you can see if it's taken.
78.988
# GEORGE
79.063
A backup system?
81.322
81.050
**LOL**
81.816
We're designing bathroom doors
with our legs exposed...
84.324
84.402
in anticipation
of the locks not working?
87.539
87.450
**LOL**
88.365
That's not a system. That's
a complete breakdown of the system.
91.965
# SUSAN
92.036
Can we change the subject, please?
94.093
# GEORGE
94.163
Why, what's wrong with it?
This is a bad subject?
96.588
# SUSAN
96.666
No, fine. If you wanna keep
talking about it, we'll talk about it.
99.969
# GEORGE
100.378
It's not that I wanna keep
talking about it.
102.471
102.547
I just think the subject should resolve
itself based on its own momentum.
105.981
# SUSAN
106.051
Well, I didn't think
that it had any momentum.
109.022
108.250
**LOL**
# GEORGE
110.764
How am I gonna do this?
112.524
112.599
I'm engaged to this woman?
She doesn't even like me.
116.199
116.270
Change the subject?
Toilets were the subject.
119.455
119.524
We don't even share
the same interests.
122.329
123.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
126.531
 Yeah, he seems pretty happy.
128.705
# ELAINE
128.705
 Well, that's all that counts, I guess.
130.879
# JERRY
132.663
What's the matter?
134.222
# ELAINE
134.290
What? Nothing.
136.466
# JERRY
137.293
You don't seem too enthused
about the whole thing.
140.014
# ELAINE
140.088
Well, what do you want me to do?
141.931
142.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
143.049
I thought you'd have
some reaction to it.
145.723
# ELAINE
148.221
Well, I don't.
150.065
149.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
151.809
I think maybe you're a little jealous.
153.652
# ELAINE
153.727
Oh, what, you think
I wanna marry George?
156.745
156.650
**LOL**
# JERRY
156.814
No, but maybe you wish it was you
who was getting married, not him.
160.200
# ELAINE
160.276
Oh, please.
That is the last thing that I want.
163.496
# JERRY
163.571
Oh, yeah. Right.
165.748
# ELAINE
165.824
Yeah, right.
167.418
# JERRY
167.492
 Laney.
169.250
# ELAINE
169.250
 Jerry.
171.008
170.050
**LOL**
# JERRY
171.079
 You don't wanna get married?
172.233
# ELAINE
172.233
 Yeah, that's right.
173.386
173.457
 I don't wanna get married.
174.421
# JERRY
174.421
 Oh, come on.
175.384
# ELAINE
175.459
 Oh, you come on.
176.339
# JERRY
176.339
 It's such...
177.219
# KRAMER
177.295
 Oh, hey.
177.861
# JERRY
177.861
 Hey.
178.426
# KRAMER
178.504
Hey, Elaine, listen, I was talking
to a friend about this dog business.
182.020
182.091
Do you realize this is going to be
on our permanent records?
186.024
185.600
**LOL**
186.096
Are you aware of this?
187.607
# ELAINE
188.014
 Oh, dear.
189.144
# KRAMER
189.144
 It can never be erased.
190.273
190.350
It'll follow us wherever we go
for the rest of our lives.
193.617
193.687
I'll never be able to get a job.
I mean, doesn't that concern you?
197.916
196.950
**LOL**
198.150
Everything I've worked for,
down the drain...
201.086
201.200
**LOL**
201.154
because of one stupid mistake.
202.962
203.031
I mean, aren't we entitled
to make one mistake in our lives?
206.048
# JERRY
206.117
 We gotta change the system.
207.063
207.300
**LOL**
# KRAMER
207.063
 Yes!
208.009
# ELAINE
208.078
I could care less.
210.218
210.539
I hope it is on our record.
I'm just sorry they didn't lock me up.
213.806
214.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
224.804
 Oh, hello, Rabbi Kursham.
226.017
# RABBI
226.017
 Elaine.
227.230
227.307
Always a pleasure to see you.
229.234
# ELAINE
229.726
Thanks again for taking care
of that dog for us.
232.448
# RABBI
232.521
Elaine, oftentimes in life
there are problems...
236.619
236.692
and just as often
there are solutions.
239.793
239.750
**LOL**
# ELAINE
240.405
Yeah, yeah, I suppose.
242.082
# RABBI
242.156
Elaine, you don't seem yourself today.
You seem, if I may say, troubled.
247.678
# ELAINE
248.497
No, Rabbi, I'm not myself.
250.589
# RABBI
251.083
Come upstairs. We'll have a talk.
254.634
# JERRY
256.756
Hey.
258.136
# GEORGE
258.215
I want your honest opinion
about something.
260.189
# JERRY
260.259
 Have I ever been less than forthright?
261.810
# GEORGE
261.810
 No, you haven't.
263.361
263.429
Well, maybe you have.
What do I know?
265.985
264.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
266.057
I probably have. Of course I have.
What am I talking about?
268.945
268.650
**LOL**
# GEORGE
269.019
Okay, tell me what you think
about this idea;
272.369
272.439
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium...
276.489
275.650
**LOL**
276.569
all the way to the floor.
277.867
# JERRY
278.195
Extend the doors on the toilet stalls
at Yankee Stadium to the floor?
283.836
283.910
Door comes down,
hides your feet.
286.299
286.371
 Yes, I like it. I like it a lot.
288.272
288.650
**LOL**
# GEORGE
288.272
 It's good, right?
290.172
# JERRY
290.250
I think it's fantastic.
I think it's a fantastic idea.
293.221
292.150
**LOL**
# GEORGE
293.295
 You do?
294.010
# JERRY
294.010
 Yes, I do.
294.724
# GEORGE
294.797
Well, I told it to Susan before
and she didn't like it.
298.313
# JERRY
# GEORGE
298.926
Yeah. Not only that,
this is what she said to me;
301.315
301.387
"Can we change the subject?"
302.863
# JERRY
302.931
 See, now, that I don't care for.
303.935
# GEORGE
303.935
 Right.
304.940
305.150
**LOL**
305.016
I mean, we're on a subject.
Why does it have to be changed?
307.738
# JERRY
307.811
It should resolve of its own volition.
309.904
# GEORGE
309.980
That's exactly what I said,
but I used the word "momentum."
312.701
# JERRY
312.775
 "Momentum," same thing.
314.242
314.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
314.242
 Same thing.
315.710
316.487
My God, I'm getting married
in December. Do you know that?
319.161
# JERRY
319.532
Yeah, I know.
321.174
# GEORGE
321.242
How am I gonna make December?
I need a little more time.
323.880
323.953
Look at me, I'm a nervous wreck.
325.512
325.580
My stomach aches.
My neck is killing me. I can't turn.
328.088
328.350
**LOL**
328.166
Look, look.
330.425
# JERRY
330.502
 You're turning.
332.135
# GEORGE
332.135
 No, that's not a good turn.
333.769
333.839
December! December!
336.098
336.175
Don't you think we should have a little
more time to get to know each other?
339.609
# JERRY
340.221
If you need more time,
you should have more time.
342.444
# GEORGE
342.682
 What, you think I could postpone it?
344.233
# JERRY
344.233
 Sure you can. Why not?
345.783
# GEORGE
345.852
 You're allowed to postpone?
347.402
# JERRY
347.402
 I don't see why not.
348.953
# GEORGE
349.690
 So I could do that?
350.903
# JERRY
350.903
 Sure, go ahead.
352.115
352.750
**LOL**
# GEORGE
355.029
All right. All right.
358.580
358.658
I'll tell you what, how about this?
I got the date.
361.000
361.077
March 21st, the first day of spring.
363.549
# JERRY
363.621
 Spring, of course.
364.958
364.650
**LOL**
# GEORGE
364.958
 You know, spring.
366.295
366.374
Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything's blooming.
369.475
369.544
All that crap.
371.518
370.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
372.714
Beautiful.
374.309
# GEORGE
374.425
 She's not gonna like it.
376.100
# JERRY
376.100
 No, she's not.
377.775
# GEORGE
378.888
You know, I think
I'm a little bit scared of her.
381.657
381.849
She's 5'3", like 100 pounds,
I'm frightened to death of her.
385.484
385.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
386.021
Well, she's a woman.
They don't like to be disappointed.
389.821
# GEORGE
389.900
Especially her.
391.791
391.860
She does not like disappointment.
394.534
396.031
Well, I have to do it.
397.163
397.241
I can't make December.
No way I can make December.
399.500
399.577
You can see that, right?
I mean, look at me.
401.670
401.746
Can I make December? I can't
make December, right? Look! Look!
405.678
403.550
**LOL**
# JERRY
405.750
 Yeah, you'd better shoot for March.
407.153
# KRAMER
# GEORGE
407.153
 March 21st.
408.555
408.628
Hey. So you're gonna
back me on this, right?
410.935
# JERRY
411.006
 Oh, all the way.
412.515
# GEORGE
412.515
 You are a good friend.
414.024
414.093
You know what, even if you killed
somebody, I wouldn't turn you in.
417.194
418.050
**LOL**
# JERRY
419.265
Is that so?
421.358
# JERRY
421.434
Hey, Kramer, if I killed somebody,
would you turn me in?
424.950
# KRAMER
425.605
Definitely.
427.579
427.250
**LOL**
# JERRY
428.358
 You're kidding.
429.695
# KRAMER
429.695
 No, no, I would turn you in.
431.032
# JERRY
432.321
 You would turn me in?
434.346
# KRAMER
434.346
 I wouldn't even think about it.
436.371
435.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
437.034
You're supposed to be
a friend of mine.
439.174
# KRAMER
439.245
Well, what kind of person are you,
going around killing people?
442.299
440.850
**LOL**
# JERRY
442.373
Well, I'm sure I had a good reason.
444.383
# KRAMER
444.459
Well, if you killed this person,
who's to say I wouldn't be next?
447.560
448.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
447.629
 But you know me.
449.263
# KRAMER
449.263
 I thought I did.
450.896
450.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
454.637
I really appreciate your taking time
to talk with me, Rabbi.
458.651
458.724
You know, I'm not of your faith.
In fact, I'm not a very religious person.
462.573
462.645
But I do feel as if I'm in need
of some guidance here.
467.408
# RABBI
467.484
Would you care for a snack
of some kind?
470.704
470.750
**LOL**
470.988
I have the SnackWells,
which are very popular...
474.421
474.491
although I think sometimes
with the so-called fat-free cookies...
478.506
478.579
people may overindulge, forgetting
that they may be high in calories.
483.887
# ELAINE
483.960
No. No, thank you.
I'm not very hungry.
487.928
484.500
**LOL**
488.006
Anyway...
490.182
491.301
this friend of mine, George,
got engaged.
494.936
# RABBI
495.014
 How wonderful.
496.019
# ELAINE
496.019
 Yeah, yeah.
497.023
497.099
Well, for some reason...
501.660
497.850
**LOL**
502.772
well, I find myself
just overcome...
505.957
506.025
with feelings of jealousy
and resentment.
509.210
# RABBI
509.279
Doesn't it give you any joy
to see your friend...
512.914
512.991
enter into this holiest of unions?
516.093
# ELAINE
516.161
No, no. No, it doesn't.
518.550
517.800
**LOL**
518.956
No joy. No joy whatsoever. It just...
The whole thing makes me...
523.054
523.127
sick.
524.935
# RABBI
526.214
You know, Elaine...
527.856
527.924
very often we cannot see
the forest for the trees.
531.773
# ELAINE
531.845
Yeah, I don't know
what that means.
533.985
# RABBI
534.890
Well, for example,
say there's a forest...
537.825
# ELAINE
537.893
Yeah, see, the thing is, Rabbi,
it should've been me.
542.323
542.398
You know? I'm smart.
I'm attractive.
546.496
# RABBI
546.569
You know, my temple
has many single functions.
550.335
# ELAINE
550.407
Oh, no, that's okay.
551.966
# RABBI
552.034
My nephew Alex is someone who's
also looking. Perhaps I could...?
557.045
556.650
**LOL**
# ELAINE
557.206
No, I don't think so.
558.848
# RABBI
558.916
He owns a flower store.
Very successful.
563.762
563.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
565.757
So you're nothing but a stoolie.
Admit it.
567.684
# KRAMER
567.759
Hey, don't do the crime
if you can't do the time.
570.860
# JERRY
571.054
 Another caffe latte?
572.373
# KRAMER
572.373
 Yeah, you better believe it.
573.692
# KRAMER
573.765
 Since when are you so trendy?
575.607
# JERRY
575.607
 Hey, baby, I set the trends.
577.449
577.520
Who do you think
started this caffe latte thing?
579.743
# JERRY
579.814
I don't recall you
drinking caffe lattes.
581.953
# KRAMER
582.024
I've been drinking caffe lattes
since the fifth grade...
584.580
584.652
and haven't looked back.
585.950
586.450
**LOL**
# JERRY
586.029
Look, Plan 9 from Outer Space
is playing tomorrow night.
588.585
588.657
 One show only.
589.703
# KRAMER
589.703
 I've always wanted to see it.
590.749
# JERRY
590.826
I was supposed to see this
five years ago.
592.800
592.870
I was in a Chinese restaurant
with George and Elaine.
595.295
595.372
We got screwed up and missed it.
596.967
# KRAMER
597.041
 Well, let's do it, huh?
597.880
597.880
 All right.
598.718
# JERRY
598.793
Look at this, Jerry.
Dropping paper on the ground.
602.226
602.296
See, that's littering.
604.057
# JERRY
604.132
Maybe you ought to call the cops
and turn me in.
606.557
606.500
**LOL**
# KRAMER
606.968
Maybe I will.
608.895
# GEORGE
614.810
 Hi.
615.856
# SUSAN
615.856
 Hey, how was your day?
616.903
617.150
**LOL**
# GEORGE
616.979
Good. Good day.
618.739
618.814
 How was...? How was your day?
620.282
# SUSAN
620.282
 Oh, it was okay.
621.750
622.276
 So, what's going on?
623.661
# GEORGE
623.661
 Oh, nothing much.
625.046
625.113
You know, went over to Jerry's,
talked to Jerry.
628.664
# SUSAN
628.742
Oh, the Lauers wanna get together
with us on Friday night.
632.176
# GEORGE
632.245
The Lauers? Really?
633.888
633.850
**LOL**
# SUSAN
633.956
 Do you not wanna go?
635.524
# GEORGE
635.524
 No, no. I wanna go.
637.092
# SUSAN
637.251
So, what did Jerry have to say?
639.723
# GEORGE
639.795
Oh, nothing much.
You know, we were talking.
643.680
643.700
**LOL**
647.800
**LOL**
651.016
I had an unbelievable idea
today.
652.943
# SUSAN
653.018
Oh, yeah, the toilets. You told me.
655.277
655.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
655.354
Yeah. No, it's not the toilets.
It's something else.
657.992
658.065
 You ready for this?
658.780
# SUSAN
658.780
 Yeah.
659.494
# GEORGE
659.567
 Okay, how about this?
660.257
660.257
 What?
660.947
661.027
 All right.
661.634
661.634
 Okay.
662.241
662.487
We get married...
664.793
664.864
March 21st,
the first day of spring.
667.538
# SUSAN
667.867
What do you mean?
You wanna postpone the wedding?
670.375
# GEORGE
670.454
No, no, this has got nothing
to do with postponing.
672.796
672.873
I just think the first day of spring
is the perfect day to get married.
676.140
676.210
Spring! Rejuvenation, rebirth,
everything is blooming. All that...
680.142
# SUSAN
680.548
If you don't wanna marry me, George,
just say so. Just say so!
685.987
684.750
**LOL**
# GEORGE
686.054
No, no, still marry. Still marry.
687.613
# SUSAN
687.681
 No, you don't love me.
689.878
# GEORGE
689.878
 No, no, still love. Still love.
692.075
# SUSAN
692.477
My friends told me
that you were too neurotic...
694.701
694.772
 and that I was making a mistake.
696.530
# GEORGE
696.530
 No, no, no. No mistake. No mistake.
698.288
698.359
Listen, we're gonna get married
over Christmas.
700.498
700.569
Really, it doesn't make
any difference to me. It's fine, really.
703.754
# SUSAN
703.823
 You sure?
705.119
# GEORGE
705.119
 Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure. Christmas.
706.414
706.493
Snow, Santa, all that stuff.
711.006
710.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
712.416
Let me take a guess.
713.678
714.460
She cried and you caved.
717.181
# GEORGE
718.422
 How did you know that?
720.282
# JERRY
720.282
 I live and breathe, my friend.
722.141
721.450
**LOL**
722.218
I live and breathe.
725.521
# GEORGE
725.597
I felt terrible. I thought she was
gonna collapse and kill herself.
728.947
# JERRY
729.017
Yes, it's very difficult.
Few men have the constitution for it.
732.451
732.521
That's why breakups
take two or three tries.
734.530
734.606
You gotta build up your immunity.
736.201
736.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
736.275
You see those tears,
you don't know what to do.
738.700
738.778
It's like she was on fire.
I was just trying to put her out.
741.795
# JERRY
743.658
Well, at least you probably had some
pretty good make-up sex afterwards.
747.838
# GEORGE
748.538
I didn't have any sex.
751.010
# JERRY
751.208
You didn't have make-up sex?
How could you not have make-up sex?
754.843
754.920
That's the best feature
of the heavy relationship.
757.476
757.450
**LOL**
# GEORGE
758.007
I missed out on the make-up sex.
761.108
# JERRY
762.428
In your situation...
763.559
763.638
the only sex you're gonna have
better than make-up sex...
766.407
766.474
is if you're sent to prison
and you have a conjugal visit.
769.611
768.750
**LOL**
# GEORGE
770.145
Yeah, conjugal-visit sex.
That is happening.
774.077
774.250
**LOL**
# MAN
779.447
Look, I can tell you're very upset,
but I'm sorry, I'm not going.
784.505
# GEORGE
787.163
Did you hear that?
788.758
789.207
I can't believe this. Look at this guy.
He's eating a sandwich.
793.685
# MAN
793.754
Are you gonna eat those fries?
796.262
795.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
801.387
This is amazing.
802.732
802.600
**LOL**
806.392
Thank you. Thank you very much.
809.244
809.350
**LOL**
809.312
I'm going back in.
810.693
811.982
Feel better.
813.624
# JERRY
814.526
Poor bastard.
816.584
815.650

821.150
**LOL**
# JERRY
824.370
Good evening, Rabbi.
825.929
# RABBI
825.997
Good evening. And how does
this evening find you?
828.635
# JERRY
828.708
Well, Rabbi. Well.
830.468
# RABBI
830.544
I trust you're here
to see your friend, Elaine?
833.265
# JERRY
833.338
 Yeah, that's right.
835.114
# RABBI
835.114
 I hope she's feeling better.
836.890
# JERRY
837.009
What do you mean?
838.354
# RABBI
838.427
 She didn't tell you?
839.414
# JERRY
839.414
 No.
840.401
841.450
**LOL**
# RABBI
841.013
Well, it seems the engagement
of her friend George...
843.901
843.975
has left her feeling
bitter and hostile.
846.483
846.350
**LOL**
# JERRY
847.896
 Is that so?
849.149
# RABBI
849.149
 Oh, yes.
850.403
850.482
In fact, she told me
that she wishes...
852.575
852.651
she was the one
who was getting married.
855.076
# JERRY
855.821
Really?
857.296
# RABBI
857.364
 She came off as pretty desperate.
859.264
# JERRY
859.264
 I didn't know any of this.
861.165
# RABBI
861.243
Apparently, she doesn't think much
of this George fellow either.
865.507
865.581
I recall the word "loser" peppered
throughout our conversation.
870.474
# JERRY
871.671
Well, this all comes as news to me.
873.681
# GEORGE
877.511
 Hi.
878.599
# SUSAN
878.599
 Hi, how was your day?
879.687
879.650
**LOL**
# GEORGE
879.764
Good. Good day.
881.358
881.432
 How was your day?
882.918
# SUSAN
882.918
 Oh, it was okay.
884.403
884.477
 So, what's going on?
886.734
# GEORGE
886.734
 Oh, nothing much, you know.
888.990
889.065
I went over to Jerry's.
You know, talked to Jerry.
892.581
893.250
**LOL**
897.116
Could l...?
Could I talk to you for a minute?
899.789
# SUSAN
899.869
Yeah, sure.
901.511
# GEORGE
901.621
All right.
903.215
904.791
You see, this is the thing.
906.718
913.250
**LOL**
913.175
I just feel like I can't do this
in December.
917.059
917.137
I just feel like I need a little more time
because I feel like I'm not ready yet.
921.532
921.600
I'm frightened and I'm scared.
924.405
923.900
**LOL**
924.479
And I just feel we need a little
more time to get to know each other.
930.000
932.154
But I could do it in March.
I promise. I promise.
935.374
933.650
**LOL**
935.449
No more postponements. I just
need three more months, please.
939.084
# SUSAN
939.161
Oh, George, George.
941.931
940.450
**LOL**
941.998
Of course.
943.426
943.499
Of course it can wait till March
if that's what you want.
947.051
# GEORGE
947.128
 Yeah?
948.424
# SUSAN
948.424
 Oh, don't worry.
949.719

Yes, of course, of course.

I have that magazine article for you.
961.110

# JERRY
961.978
You know, I had a little talk
with the rabbi outside.
964.569
# ELAINE
964.647
 Oh, you did?
965.776
965.776
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
966.906
# JERRY
966.983
Understand you had
a little talk with him too.
969.870
968.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
969.944
Yeah, we talked earlier.
971.836
# JERRY
971.905
Yes, I know, I know.
974.710
973.600
**LOL**
977.953
 What does that mean?
979.711
# JERRY
979.711
 Nothing. Nothing.
981.469
984.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
987.130
 He didn't mention...?
988.366
# JERRY
988.366
 Yes, he did.
989.602
990.050
**LOL**
# ELAINE
989.674
 He told you about the conversation?
991.723
# JERRY
991.723
 Oh, we had quite a little chat.
993.772
# ELAINE
993.845
 He told you about...?
995.728
# JERRY
995.728
 Yes, how you are jealous of George.
997.611
997.683
How you wish you were
getting married instead of him.
1000.239
1000.150
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1000.311
He told you that? How could he?
1001.988
# JERRY
1002.063
And it didn't take much
prodding either, I have to say.
1004.915
1003.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1004.982
 Can he do that?
1006.533
# JERRY
1006.533
 He did.
1008.084
# ELAINE
1008.153
But he's a rabbi. How can a rabbi
have such a big mouth?
1012.001
# JERRY
1012.073
That's what's so fascinating.
1014.000
1014.250
**LOL**
# JERRY
1015.953
You better finish your
little caffe latte there.
1018.176
1018.247
 They'll never let you in with it.
1019.359
# KRAMER
1019.359
 Why not?
1020.470
# JERRY
1020.541
Because they don't allow
outside drinks into the movie.
1023.678
# KRAMER
1023.920
 Well, that's stupid.
1025.363
# JERRY
1025.363
 That's the rule.
1026.807
# KRAMER
1026.881
Yeah, well, we'll just see if
we can't get around that.
1030.018
# RABBI
1036.350
Oh, Elaine, come in, come in.
1038.775
1039.228
 So nice to see you again.
1040.399
# ELAINE
1040.399
 Yeah.
1041.570
# RABBI
1041.647
Can I offer you some
kasha varnishkes?
1045.116
1044.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1045.193
No, no. Listen, Rabbi,
I'd like to ask you a question.
1048.709
1048.780
Why? Why did you tell my friend
Jerry what I talked to you about?
1052.960
# RABBI
1053.034
 Was that a problem for you?
1055.499
1055.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1055.499
 Of course it was problem for me!
1057.963
1058.290
You didn't...? You didn't tell
anyone else about this, did you?
1061.557
# RABBI
1061.627
Well, let's see....
1063.720
1063.300
**LOL**
1064.338
I seem to recall a conversation
with Mrs. Winston in 1F.
1069.480
# ELAINE
1069.552
Mrs. Winston?
1070.684
# RABBI
1070.971
Yes, we were waiting
for our mail to arrive...
1073.396
1073.473
and I happened to mention
to her...
1076.029
1076.101
how you felt it was never
going to "happen" for you.
1079.072
1079.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1081.315
What about Don Ramsey? You didn't
mention anything to him, did you?
1084.998
# RABBI
1085.236
Don Ramsey?
1086.367
# ELAINE
1086.446
You know, that tall good-looking guy,
he lives on the fifth floor?
1089.713
# RABBI
1089.783
Oh, him.
1091.591
1091.660
Well, this morning I happened
to find myself in the elevator with him.
1095.211
1093.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1095.289
Oh, my God, you didn't.
1097.428

Excuse me.

1118.272
Hey, hey, what's going on?
What just happened here?
1120.945
# KRAMER
1121.025
Nothing. Nothing.
1122.287
# USHER
1122.360
What do you got? One of those
caffe lattes in your shirt?
1125.295
# KRAMER
1125.363
I don't have anything. What?
Ask him.
1128.583
# USHER
1130.452
All right. Come on, coffee boy.
1132.379
# KRAMER
1132.454
 What?

1133.773
 Come on, now. Here we go.
1135.092
# KRAMER
# ELAINE
1138.085
I mean, the whole thing is a mess.
He told everyone in the building.
1142.230
1142.298
I ran into that cute guy
on the fifth floor...
1144.391
1144.467
I mean, he could barely
bring himself to nod.
1147.023
# JERRY
1148.179
Elaine, if I could say a word here
about the Jewish people.
1152.111
1152.200
**LOL**
1153.059
That man in no way
represents our ability...
1155.864
1155.938
to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip
and keep it to ourselves.
1159.988
1159.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1160.067
You didn't say anything
to George, did you?
1161.994
# JERRY
1162.069
No.
1163.414
1163.487
About how you wish it was you who
was getting married instead of him.
1166.672
1166.741
 Feelings of resentment, hostility.
1168.855
# ELAINE
1168.855
 Yeah, yeah. So what?
1170.969
1170.800
**LOL**

 Hey.

**LOL**
1177.085
Oh, my God, I haven't seen you
since it happened.
1181.100
1181.173
I couldn't be happier for you.

# GEORGE
1184.302
Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.
1185.682

1185.845
Oh, come on. Come on.
You really, really deserve it.
1190.524
# GEORGE
1191.017
Deserve?
I don't know about deserve.
1192.944
# ELAINE
1193.019
Are you kidding?
1194.151
1194.229
I have seen the changes in you
the past couple of years.
1197.247
1197.316
Man, you have grown.
You've matured.
1201.366
# GEORGE
1201.570
Yeah, I guess I'm getting older.
1203.544
# ELAINE
1203.823
Well, I just think it's wonderful.
Honestly.
1207.672

I've gotta run, but please,
please give my best to Susan.

Listen, if you ever get a date...
1218.223
1218.297
maybe the four of us
could go out together sometime.

# ELAINE

Yes. Yes, yes. Sure.
1224.818
# GEORGE
1224.887
Wasn't there some guy in your
building that you said you liked?
1227.775
1227.849
He lived up on the fifth floor
or something?
1230.238
# ELAINE
1230.310
 Yes. Yes, yes, yes.
1231.421
# GEORGE
1231.421
 Yeah.

 Boy, she is something, isn't she?
1235.573
# JERRY
1235.573
 Yeah, she's something else.
1237.041
1237.050
**LOL**
1237.109
Hey, so, what happened?
Did you hold your ground or...?
1239.700
# GEORGE
1239.778
 Nope. I wept like a baby.
1242.017
# JERRY
1242.017
 What?
1244.256
1242.650
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1244.325
Well, I started to tell her, and then
all of a sudden, for some reason...
1247.675
1247.745
I just burst into tears.
1249.672
# JERRY
1249.747
 You cried?
1251.066
# GEORGE
1251.066
 I bawled uncontrollably.
1252.386
1252.459
I just poured my guts out. And
I'll tell you, Jerry, it was incredible.
1256.224
1256.421
I never realized how powerful
these tears are.
1259.013
1259.091
I could have postponed it
another five years if I wanted to.
1262.607
1261.000
**LOL**

# JERRY
1264.305
Sorry about that movie thing.
I was joking around.
1266.896
# KRAMER
1266.974
Sorry? Are you kidding?
1268.569
1268.643
You did me the biggest favour
of my life.
1270.451
1270.520
I spoke to a lawyer.
We're suing for millions.
1274.488
1273.550
**LOL**
# JERRY
1274.566
 Suing? What for?
1276.680
# KRAMER
1276.680
 The coffee was too hot.
1278.794
# JERRY
1279.697
 It's supposed to be hot.
1281.372
# KRAMER
1281.372
 Not that hot.
1283.047
# RABBI
1290.542
The prophet lsaiah tells us
that without friends...
1294.936
1292.750
**LOL**
1295.005
our lives are empty
and meaningless.
1298.141
# GEORGE
1298.217
Wait a minute. That's the rabbi
from Elaine's building.
1301.733
1301.804
I just met this guy the other day.
1304.193
1304.700

# RABBI

A young lady I know,
let's call her Elaine...
1309.156
1309.300
**LOL**
1312.399
happened to find herself
overwhelmed...
1315.251
1315.318
with feelings of resentment
and hostility for her friend...
1319.547
1319.615
Iet's call him George.
1321.423
1321.500
**LOL**
1323.703
She felt that George
was somewhat of a loser...
1326.804
1327.700
**LOL**
1327.290
and that she was the one
who deserved to be married first.
1332.017
1332.253
She also happened to mention to me
that her friend had wondered...
1337.265
1337.342
if going to a prostitute while you're
engaged is considered cheating.
1342.520
1342.900
**LOL**
1344.150
**LOL**
1346.227
His feeling was...
1347.987
1348.062
they're never going
to see each other again...
1350.285
1350.356
so, what's the difference?
1352.745
1351.700
**LOL**
1353.193
But that is a subject
for another sermon.
1356.994
1366.400
