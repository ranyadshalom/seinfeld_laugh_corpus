 No, we just came up for the funeral.

# HELEN

Poor Marvin Kessler.
He went too early.
9.835
# JERRY
9.911
He was 96 years old.
12.479
12.100
**LOL**
# MORTY
12.547
That had nothing to do with it.
The man was out of shape.
15.639
15.850
**LOL**
# HELEN
17.752
That's why we joined a program.
19.683
19.754
We walk once around the block
three times a week.
22.049
# MORTY
22.123
And every morning I eat a plum.
24.487
24.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
24.559
Well, whatever you're doing,
you're wearing me out.
27.059
# HELEN
27.128
What about you?
28.252
# MORTY
28.329
Yeah, looks like you're getting
a little spare tire there, tiger.
31.694
# JERRY
31.766
 Really?
33.016
# KRAMER
33.016
 Hey, Seinfelds.
34.266
# MORTY
34.335
 Hey, Mr. Kramer.
35.415
# KRAMER
35.415
 How long you staying?
36.494
# HELEN
36.571
We just came to town for funeral.
38.195
# KRAMER
38.272
Oh, yeah, yeah, I heard.
Yeah, Marvin Kessler.
41.273
41.342
Boy, that makes you think.
43.603
43.250
**LOL**
44.145
If he could go.
45.940
# HELEN
46.581
See you downstairs at the car.
48.080
# JERRY
48.149
Sure you don't need a hand?
49.511
# MORTY
49.584
No, no.
The luggage is on the program.
51.845
51.919
I got a brick in here.

# JERRY
59.527
 Did you give blood?
61.028
# KRAMER
61.028
 No, no, not giving. Hoarding.
62.528
62.597
I'm storing it at the blood bank,
just in case.
65.632
# JERRY
65.700
In case of what?
66.824
# KRAMER
66.901
Jerry, I know myself.
69.299
69.370
If I'm out on the street
and it starts to go down...
71.768
71.839
I don't back off until it's finished.
74.533
73.950
**LOL**
# JERRY
75.443
 Are we finished?
76.608

 You haven't seen Jimmy for years.
86.017
# ELAINE
86.017
 I know.
87.147
87.221
Well, I'm glad I got to see him
before he hit puberty and got...
90.154
90.224
you know, all lurchy and awkward.
94.090
# VIVIAN
94.162
Actually, I'm gonna need someone
to look after him tomorrow evening.
97.561
# ELAINE
97.632
 Tomorrow evening? Sure.

 Do you know anyone responsible?

Oh, incense. For the mood.
115.041
# GEORGE
115.116
Oh, yes, by all means. The mood.
117.684
118.350
**LOL**
118.186
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to lend support for the mood.
122.655
122.350
**LOL**
# GEORGE
125.960
 Cream soda?
127.040

 Vanilla.

**LOL**
# ELAINE
138.339
Can you believe that?
139.599
139.674
Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible.
141.435
# JERRY
141.509
Who wants to be responsible?
Whenever anything goes wrong...
144.271
144.345
the first thing they ask is,
"Who's responsible for this?"
147.312
# ELAINE
147.381
I couldn't raise a kid?
149.210
149.283
Come on,
I love bossing people around.
151.783
152.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
155.556
 I thought you're with Tara tonight.
156.971
# GEORGE
156.971
 I was. I had to leave.
158.386
158.750
**LOL**
158.459
She lit this vanilla incense.
The smell drove me nuts.
161.551
161.629
All I could think about was food.
I had to get out.
164.095
163.900
**LOL**
164.165
Gonna need some pudding here.
Pudding.
167.200
# ELAINE
167.268
You just left? What did you tell her?
169.666
# GEORGE
169.737
Told her I had a bus transfer
that was only good for another hour.
173.364
172.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
175.209
 What?
176.624
# GEORGE
176.624
 I don't know. I was starving, Jerry.
178.039
# GEORGE
178.112
Oh, pudding.
179.975
180.047
You want some?
181.512
# JERRY
181.582
Hey, you guys think
I'm getting a little chunky?
185.083
# GEORGE
185.152
What? Are you kidding?
We look great.
188.153
188.550
**LOL**
188.756
You know what this pudding needs?
190.346
190.424
The skin on the top, like when your
mother used to make it on the stove.
193.721
# JERRY
193.794
What do you think?
194.883
# ELAINE
194.962
I think you're getting a little pudding
under the skin yourself.
198.190
200.350
**LOL**
# KRAMER
201.569
My service rates went up?
203.364
203.437
You banks are all the same...
205.129
205.206
with your hidden fees
and your service charges.
208.571
208.550
**LOL**
208.643
Maybe I'll just take my blood
elsewhere, yeah.
210.904
# BANKEMPLOYEE
210.978
We could transfer it
to another bank for you.
213.012
# KRAMER
213.080
Oh, no, no. No more banks.
I'm keeping my blood in my freezer...
216.013
216.083
with my money!
218.515
217.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
222.290
So, what do you say?
224.517
# TARA
224.592
I guess we could use some food
in our lovemaking.
228.719
228.950
**LOL**
# GEORGE
229.397
Okay, we got your...
Got your strawberries.
233.228
233.301
Your chocolate sauce.
235.369
235.469
Your pastrami on rye with mustard.
238.936
238.600
**LOL**
239.407
 Your honey...
240.139
# TARA
240.139
 Wait.
240.872
240.942
Pastrami on rye with mustard?
242.942
# GEORGE
243.044
Don't you remember they...?
244.509
244.578
They used pastrami in that movie,
9 1/2 Weeks.
247.340
247.415
 Remember the pastrami scene?
248.745
# TARA
248.745
 No.
250.075
# GEORGE
250.151
Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters.
251.980
251.850
**LOL**
252.053
Whatever it was, it worked.
254.815
# JERRY
258.192
 Didn't go for it, huh?
259.226
# GEORGE
259.226
 No.
260.260
# JERRY
260.328
So she didn't appreciate the erotic
qualities of the salted-cured meats.
264.626
# GEORGE
267.201
She tolerated the strawberries
and the chocolate sauce...
271.362
271.572
but it's not a meal, you know?
273.833
274.342
Food and sex.
Those are my two passions.
277.172
277.244
It's only natural to combine them.
279.676
# JERRY
280.114
Natural?
281.203
281.282
Sex is about love between a man and
a woman, not a man and a sandwich.
285.409
284.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
286.020
Jerry, I'm not suggesting
getting rid of the girl.
288.588
288.656
She's integral.
290.246
# JERRY
290.324
Maybe instead of trying
to satisfy two of your needs...
292.892
292.960
how about satisfying one
of somebody else's?
295.756
295.550
**LOL**
# GEORGE
297.031
Speaking of which,
I found a way to separate the skin...
299.725
299.800
from the top of the pudding
without leaving any on the edges.
302.733
302.803
X-Acto knife.
304.598
304.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
304.672
I told you, George, no more pudding.
I'm starting a purification program.
308.230
308.309
Keep all that kind of food
away from me.
310.639
# GEORGE
310.711
Well, then I guess these would be
out of the question.
315.111

What the hell is that?

Right across the hall.

**LOL**
# JERRY
339.685
 No, I don't.
340.799

In fact, if even one corpuscle
of that blood...
343.876
343.944
should find its way across that hall,
I will freak out on you, Kramer.
347.912
347.800

Freak out.

# ELAINE
370.337
Vivian left me a message.
372.405
372.473
I guess a certain someone...
374.803
374.875
changed her mind whether
someone was responsible enough...
377.773
377.845
to watch a certain other someone.
379.537
# JERRY
379.613
 Is this about me?
380.578
# ELAINE
380.578
 No.

399.399
399.767
Yeah, I'll be there.
401.061
401.402
Yeah, later.
402.730

Well, somebody's babysitting.

I can feel his blood inside of me.

Doing quite well, thank you.
646.736

Yesterday I had a soft-boiled egg
and a quickie.
649.712
651.285

I found out that Vivian's got

I mean, if anything happens to her,
I'm on deck.

Would you like a kidney too?
Because I'll give it to you.

And then he put this plastic bag
over his head...
846.704
846.780
and started running around
until he got tired...
849.144
849.216
and he laid down somewhere.
