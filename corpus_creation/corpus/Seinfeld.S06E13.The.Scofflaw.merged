The big new accessory
with eyeglasses
3.571
3.604
seems to be that strap
that connects in the back
5.571
5.604
so you can take 'em on and off.
7.004
7.050
**LOL**
7.038
Which I don't get, because
I thought if you have glasses,
9.571
9.604
isn't that because
you need to wear glasses?
13.571
12.700
**LOL**
13.604
You need glasses.
14.971
15.004
Isn't that what they say?
16.138
16.171
I mean, an eye doctor
doesn't say,
17.604
17.638
"Would you care
for some glasses?"
19.871
21.604
When people have crutches,
23.071
23.104
they don't have like a little
chain attached to their belt,
25.771
25.804
so they can just let go of them
every now and then.
28.104
28.138
Why not get a toupee
with a rubber band
30.000
30.471
for when you're water-skiing?
The thing could just...

I was yelling
at the litterbug.

a few months ago.

Was he on his deathbed?

Mr. Kramer,
let me tell you a story.
304.156
304.189
In 1979, I ticketed
a brown Dodge Diplomat
305.202
308.022
for parking
in a church zone.
309.656
309.689
That fine
was never paid.
311.889
311.922
And since then,
that scofflaw
313.189
313.350
**LOL**
313.222
has piled up
more parking tickets
314.889
314.922
than anyone
in New York City.
317.056
317.089
For 16 years,
I pursued him,
319.522
319.556
only to see him
give me the slip
321.222
321.256
time and time again.
322.856
322.889
I've never got
a clean look at his face,
325.556
325.589
but he's become
my white whale.
328.722
328.756
Mr. Kramer,
that day was yesterday!
332.222
332.256
But thanks to you,
333.656
333.689
I don't know if I'll ever
get that chance again.
335.202
# KRAMER
337.322
I like that eye patch.
339.056
# GEORGE
341.756
All right.
I'm gonna move my car.
343.389
343.422
My meter's up.
344.856
344.889
You can't park
in this city.
346.489
# GARY
347.256
Hey, George,
listen,
348.556
348.589
you know that
company I work for?
349.989
350.022
They own that parking lot
around the corner.
352.056
# GEORGE
352.089
That's a Kinney lot?
353.689
# GARY
353.722
Yeah. And there's
a space opening up, and...
356.856
356.889
I-I could get it for you.
358.122
358.156
You'd just have to
pay the tax on it.
359.622
359.656
It'd be, like, 50 a month.
360.789

No! No, Kramer,
you don't understand.
431.556
431.589
He made the last
contact between us.
433.322
433.356
I had the upper hand in
the post break-up relationship.
437.522
437.556
If he thinks that I said hi,
then I lose the upper hand.

# JAKE
984.487
Where did you get those?

# ELAINE
985.820
Malaysia. I was in the area.

All right.
995.220

Now, you listen,
and you listen good.
997.520

Don't play dumb!

It's me, Cosmo.
1007.254

# NEWMAN
1007.287
All right, so it's me.
So what?

# KRAMER
1009.120
You don't think
I know how you're feeling
1011.287
1011.320
every second of the day,
1012.705
1013.087
looking over
your shoulder
1014.287
1014.320
to see if someone's
comin' up from behind,
1016.087
1016.120
sitting alone at night,
1017.087
1017.120
knowing they could
be closing in?
1018.920
# NEWMAN
1018.954
I can't sleep, I tell you.
I can't sleep.
1021.087

**LOL**
# KRAMER
1021.120
Of course you can't,
you poor sap.
1023.387
1023.420
Now, why didn't you tell me?
1024.620
# NEWMAN
1024.654
I couldn't.
I couldn't tell anyone.
1026.387
# KRAMER
1026.420
So you've been living
this secret by yourself?
1028.620
# NEWMAN
1028.654
It's been awful.

1029.654
[SOBBING]
1031.787
1030.350
**LOL**
1031.820
I wanted
to tell somebody.
1034.087

Help me, Kramer.
1035.454

# GEORGE
1037.887
I'll try some on
and see how they look.
1039.720
1039.754
It's just hair.
1041.254
# JERRY
1041.287
You ever see what that thing
looks like in the back?
1042.705
1043.454
You got your natural
little curls on the bottom,
1045.454
1045.487
and then that big phony mat
coming down on top of it.
1048.087
# GEORGE
1048.120
Well, some of them
look good.
1049.454
1049.487
The ones that look good,
you don't even know about.
1051.620
# JERRY
1051.654
What if you get involved
with a woman?
1053.254
1053.287
How you gonna tell her?
1054.254
# GEORGE
1054.287
The way they make
them these days,
1055.720
1055.754
I'll never have
to tell her.
1057.020
# JERRY
1057.054
So you keep it a secret
your whole life?
1059.087
1058.550
**LOL**
1059.120
Then at your funeral,
the mortician comes out,
1061.087
1061.120
"Here, Mrs. Costanza.
I thought you might want this."

Oh, it's no secret
1067.854
1067.887
that it's my dream to have
my own publishing house.
1070.587
1070.620
And if this Jake Jarmel book
does,
1072.387
1072.420
you know, what I think
it's gonna do,
1072.705
1074.054
if I can get this whole thing
off the ground, then, you know,
1076.754
1076.787
I think I'll have
something for you.
1078.287
# ELAINE
1078.320
Oh, Mr. Lippman.
1079.554
1079.587
[BOTH LAUGH]
1082.054
1082.087
That is so exciting.
1083.787
1083.820
I mean, you have no idea
how sick I am
1086.187
1086.220
of running around town
looking for socks.
Yeah.
1088.687
1089.100
**LOL**
# LIPPMAN
1088.720
By the way, those are
great glasses.

# ELAINE
1091.120
Oh, really, you like 'em?
Mm-hmm.
1092.587
# LIPPMAN
1092.620
Very unusual.
1093.920

1093.954
Well, you know what?
1094.920
# LIPPMAN
1094.954
What?
1095.954
# ELAINE
1095.987
You can have 'em.

Oh, no, no.

1098.487
No, no! Go to that
place on the corner.
1100.054
1100.087
They'll change
the prescription in an hour.
1101.954
1101.987
Take 'em.
Really?
1102.705
# LIPPMAN
# ELAINE
1102.987
I have no use
for them anymore.
1104.254
# LIPPMAN
1104.287
I could use a new pair
of reading glasses.
1106.720
# ELAINE
1106.754
They're from Malaysia.
1107.954
# LIPPMAN
1107.987

Well, Mr. Newman,
1113.420
1113.454
in all my years
on the bench,
1115.454
1115.487
I have never come across
anything quite like this.
1119.287
1119.320
I have given this matter
some very serious consideration,
1124.020
1124.054
and I've decided
that what's best for the city,
1126.520
1126.554
and possibly
for yourself,
1128.354
1128.387
is for you
to keep your car in a garage
1131.220
# JUDGE
1131.254
convenient
to your home.

# NEWMAN
1132.654

1133.700
**LOL**
1134.820
I can't afford that.
1136.387
# JUDGE
1136.420
Afford it, you will,
Mr. Newman,
1138.954
1138.987
or this court will see
1141.020
# JUDGE
1141.054
that your car is impounded
and sold at auction.
1144.187
# KRAMER
1144.220
Oh, don't you worry,
Your Honor.

# JERRY

It's not good,
okay?

1163.620
It's not good.

You look...

this has not been
custom-fitted to his scalp.

looks pretty good.

Why don't you get
a pair of white shoes,

1177.887
move down to Miami Beach, and
get the whole thing over with?
1180.654

1184.387
Well, maybe you could
show me something else.
1186.454
# SALESMAN

As I said,
it'll be different
1187.720
1187.754
once we design something
specifically for you.

1190.654
But I don't think your friend
here is being very helpful.

being disruptive!

your friend to improve his life.

the bottom of your tub
