You know, doctors must be such
a prestigious occupation...
3.662
1.300
**LOL**
3.950
**LOL**
3.688
but it's one of the only jobs...
5.517
5.590
where you have to have your
diploma right up there on the wall.
8.659
8.726
It makes them seem
so insecure, doesn't it?
10.885
10.962
"I really am a doctor, you know.
13.792
14.432
If you think I'm not,
just check it out."
17.160
18.369
I don't know why they need
these little bits...
20.528
20.605
of psychological
leverage over us.
22.332
22.407
"Go in that room, take your pants off,
wait 15 minutes...
25.067
25.143
then I'll give you my opinion."
27.905
28.513
After that, anybody with pants on...
30.444
30.515
seems like they know
what they're talking about.
32.879
32.951
In any difference of opinion,
pants always beats no pants.

# GEORGE
43.027
Can I say one word to you?
45.152
45.229
Lobster.
46.819
46.898
The lobster here is unbelievable.
48.829
51.336
A little expensive.
53.301
52.900
**LOL**
# SASHA
53.671
 Twenty-five dollars.
55.189
# GEORGE
55.189
 Yes, well, you know...
56.706
56.774
I'm not thinking about the price.
59.069
59.143
You know, you're the only woman
I've never thought about the price.
62.474
62.547
Get the lobster. I beg you to get it.
64.308
64.382
 Go for it. Go for the lobster.
65.695

# SASHA
65.695
 George...
67.007
67.085
George...
68.812
68.886
I think we have to talk.
71.113
71.189
I think we have a problem.
73.189
# GEORGE
73.891
We do?
75.390
# SASHA
76.361
We can't keep seeing each other.
78.395
# GEORGE
79.330
Why?
81.057
# SASHA
81.499
Because it's over.
84.727
83.150
**LOL**
86.170
It's my parents, George.
88.761
88.840
The differences in our religion...
91.500
93.011
George...
94.703
94.779
can you ever forgive me?
97.643
98.316
Have you decided yet?
100.611
# SASHA
101.052
Yes. I'll have the lobster.
104.280
102.150
**LOL**
# GEORGE
108.760
You know, I'm starting to think that
maybe lobster isn't the way to go.
113.354
# JERRY
115.500
 What? He asked you out?
117.183
# ELAINE
117.183
 We started to talk, I told him I jog...
118.865
118.936
and he put his hand on my heart.
120.550
# JERRY
120.550
 On your heart?
122.164
# ELAINE
122.340
 Jerry, the man is a doctor.
124.056
# JERRY
124.056
 Doctor. He's a podiatrist.
125.773
125.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
125.843
So? Same thing.
127.433
# JERRY
127.512
Anyone can get into podiatry school.
George got into podiatry school.
130.911
# ELAINE
131.082
 Really?
132.013
# TAWNI
132.013
 Sure.

 Hello.

# JERRY
134.498
 Oh, hi.
135.611
# TAWNI
135.887
 Are you gonna be stopping by later?
137.302
# JERRY
137.302
 Yes, I'll be stopping.
138.717
139.050
**LOL**
# TAWNI
138.790
 Okay. I'll see you later.
140.257
# JERRY
140.257
 See you later.
141.723
143.194
Well, we can't all be
dating podiatrists.
145.558
145.850
**LOL**
# GEORGE
151.035
 It's over.
152.501
# ELAINE
152.501
 What?
153.968
# JERRY
154.038
 How'd you get in?
155.305
155.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
155.305
 Kramer.
156.572
# ELAINE
156.641
 What's that?
157.925
# GEORGE
157.925
 Lobster.
159.209
# JERRY
161.245
Looks like a swan.
163.643
# GEORGE
164.115
 She says we can't go out anymore.
165.661
# ELAINE
165.661
 Why?
167.207
# GEORGE
167.285
Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox.
169.819
170.688
Her parents won't let her date
anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox!
174.588
# ELAINE
174.826
Latvian Orthodox?
177.360
177.428
It is lobster.
179.291
178.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
179.363
She's limiting herself
to Latvian Orthodox?
182.261
182.333
 That's too bad.
183.600
# GEORGE
183.600
 I know.
184.867
184.969
This was the only woman
I never lied to.
187.867
187.939
Well, that's not entirely true.
190.200
189.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
190.274
Oh, whatever.
191.932
# ELAINE
192.977
 This is delicious.
194.324
# JERRY
194.324
 Succulent.
195.671
195.250
**LOL**
# GEORGE
197.215
She knew I didn't have a job.
She knew I lived at home.
200.443
200.518
Didn't seem to bother her.
202.745
202.820
I think I could have married
this woman.
205.184
204.450
**LOL**
# ELAINE
205.289
Why don't you just ask her parents?
207.220
# GEORGE
207.325
I can't. I met them. They're devout.
210.553
210.150
**LOL**
210.628
You know, in the cab
on the way over here, I...
214.129
214.198
I actually thought about converting.
216.960
216.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
217.668
 To Latvian Orthodox?
219.618
# GEORGE
219.618
 Why not? What do I care?
221.568
223.250
**LOL**
# JERRY
223.641
You know, it's not like
changing toothpaste.
226.437
225.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
226.577
I think it would be romantic.
228.941
# GEORGE
230.181
 Really?
231.727
# ELAINE
231.727
 Yeah. It's like Edward Vlll...
233.273
233.384
abdicating the throne
to marry Mrs. Simpson.
237.181
237.450
**LOL**
# GEORGE
238.156
Like King Edward.
239.883
240.658
 Like King Edward, Jerry.
242.090
# JERRY
242.090
 Yeah, well...
243.522
242.700
**LOL**
243.594
King Edward didn't live in Queens
with Frank and Estelle Costanza.
247.755
# GEORGE
248.399
You know what?
I could probably do this.
250.831
250.902
 What's the difference?
252.283
# ELAINE
252.283
 George, I was just kidding around.
253.664
254.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
253.738
I wouldn't even tell her.
I could surprise her.
256.204
# ELAINE
256.274
 George, I wasn't serious.
257.923
# GEORGE
257.923
 How hard could it be?
259.571
259.644
You make a little contribution,
you have a ceremony.
263.111
263.648
I am gonna think about this.
265.909
265.983
I am really gonna think about this.
269.246
# ELAINE
270.721
 I guess this one is my fault.
272.238
# JERRY
272.238
 Oh, yeah.
273.756
# TAWNI
280.565
That was nice. Have you always
been such a good kisser?
284.066
# JERRY
285.336
I don't know. Not always.
287.529
287.850
**LOL**
287.605
No?
289.036
289.106
No, I... I had to work at it.
292.039
292.250
**LOL**
292.176
As a kid, while kids were out playing,
I'd be in my room practicing kissing.
296.007
# TAWNI
296.914
It was worth it.
298.743
299.650
I'll be right back.
302.878
306.891
 Where are you going?
308.107
# JERRY
308.107
 To wash my hands.
309.323
309.393
 They're sticky from the orange.
310.825
# TAWNI
310.825
 Meet you back here?
312.257

Fungicide?
337.688
338.189
Fungus?
339.950
# JERRY
343.127
Fungicide.
344.956
346.931
 I mean, what could she have?
348.028
# ELAINE
348.028
 I don't know.
349.124
# KRAMER
349.200
 Fungus.
350.399
# JERRY
350.399
 Exactly.
351.598
# ELAINE
352.937
 So, what'd you say?
354.369
# JERRY
354.369
 I said I was coming down...
355.801
355.873
with the flu and I had to go home.
357.998
# ELAINE
358.075
What were you doing
opening her medicine cabinet?
360.643
# JERRY
360.711
I didn't open it. It was open.
I just nudged it a little.
365.680
# ELAINE
365.983
 You were snooping.
367.313
# JERRY
367.313
 I was not snooping.
368.643
368.786
I did not break the seal.
There was no breaking and entering.
371.719
370.800
**LOL**
371.789
 I wouldn't do that.
372.868
# KRAMER
372.868
 I would.
373.948
375.359
I always open medicine cabinets.
377.290
# ELAINE
377.528
Well, I trust people not to do that.
380.529
# KRAMER
380.598
Big mistake.
382.393
# JERRY
384.669
Why don't you ask
that doctor what it is.
387.237
# ELAINE
387.305
Now he's a doctor?
Before he was a podiatrist.
390.465
# JERRY
390.608
But that's what podiatrists do.
They deal in fungus.
394.166
393.650
**LOL**
394.245
They're knee-deep in fungus.
This guy knows fungus.
397.906
# ELAINE
398.182
I am not going to ask him
about funguses.
401.149
# KRAMER
401.419
Fungi.
403.043
# JERRY
404.689
 What?
406.286
# KRAMER
406.286
 Fungi.
407.883
412.997
Why do you want to accept
the Latvian Orthodox faith?
417.659
# GEORGE
419.971
In this age of uncertainty
and confusion...
424.337
422.650
**LOL**
425.643
a man begins to ask himself
certain questions.
430.043
430.748
How can one even begin
to put into words something so...
435.148
435.353
Enigmatic?
437.318
# GEORGE
437.755
 Vast?
439.170
# GEORGE
439.170
 No, not vast.
440.585
440.100
**LOL**
441.225
Well, whatever it is,
basically you like the religion.
445.022
# GEORGE
445.229
 Yes.
446.559
446.559
 Is there one aspect of the faith...
447.889
447.965
you find particularly attractive?
450.363
450.650
**LOL**
# GEORGE
452.570
I think the hats.
454.695
458.109
The hat conveys that solemn
religious look you want in a faith.
462.475
462.913
Very pious.
464.139
464.615
Are you familiar
with Orthodox theology?
468.310
# GEORGE
469.253
Well, perhaps not to the extent
that you are, but...
474.450
473.900
**LOL**
475.259
But I know the basic plot, yeah.
477.623
478.562
 Plot?
479.977
# GEORGE
479.977
 Yes, you know, the flood...
481.392
481.465
and the lepers
and the commandments and all that.
485.001
483.850
**LOL**
485.069
Well, it's obvious
you are sincere in your desire.
488.434
# GEORGE
488.706
Oh, yes, I am, Father.
Incredibly sincere.
492.640
492.710
So...
494.334
494.412
am I in?
496.173
495.350
**LOL**
497.681
The first step would be
to familiarize yourself...
501.342
501.419
with these texts.
504.352
505.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
506.524
You see, Father, I'm incredibly
anxious to become a member.
510.822
511.395
Don't you offer any kind
of an express conversion?
514.692
514.250
**LOL**
514.765
A quick change?
516.594
# SISTERROBERTA
516.967
Yes?
518.159
519.003
Oh, I'm sorry. Father, there's a man
waiting in the chapel.
522.630
522.706
Well, you may attend to it, Sister.
525.001
525.142
This is George Costanza.
He is interested in joining the Church.

537.555
Nice nun.
539.589
539.790
No, no. Sister Roberta is not a nun.
542.757
542.860
She is what we call a novice.
545.554
545.629
She won't be taking her final vows

567.017
I can't believe how easy it is.
I'm virtually Orthodox.

571.055
All I have to do is read a few books,
memorize a few prayers...
574.318

planning on telling Mother Costanza?

 You picked up on a vibe from a nun.

I have this power...
625.842

 Yeah. But there's a problem.
658.535
658.609
I found a tube of a fungicide
in her medicine cabinet.
661.678
660.050
**LOL**
# GEORGE
662.446
 So?
663.810
# JERRY
663.810
 So I don't know why she's using it.
665.174
# GEORGE
665.282
How do you even know it's hers?
Maybe it belonged to Carol.
668.545
668.619
 Did you see a name on the tube?
669.766
# JERRY
669.766
 I didn't look.
670.914

670.988
Well, take a look.
It might not even belong to her.

You went to podiatry school...
723.395
723.474
which I'm sure is very grueling
in its own way.
727.408
# DOCTOR
727.478
I went to podiatry school
because I like feet.

about how podiatrists

How could you say that?

That's your fault.
You just got me thinking.

She said she's never had a man...

937.988
I know what this is about, Father.
I didn't do anything.
941.080
941.158
I just spoke to her innocently
for just a few minutes.
943.988
944.094
It's just that I...

Once you put medicine
in your cabinet...
1273.685
1273.757
you're never using it again.
Medicine you use is on the sink.
1276.826
1276.893
It's not really a medicine cabinet.
It's really like an ointment museum.
1280.690
1280.764
It's like, "Here's a salve from 1983...
1283.731
1283.834
some cream from the '70s."
But you want to keep it private.
1287.392
