Oh, hey. Hey, have I told you
about my bunions?
1099.734
1099.768
Oh, you're gonna love
this story.
1101.368
1101.401
So I line up my cold cuts
1102.901
1102.934
on the couch next to me,
but as I'm stacking 'em up,
1104.088
1105.501
they keep falling
into my footbath.

We don't wanna hear

Oh, I bought a bunch
of bunion stories from Newman.
1116.534
1116.850
**LOL**
1116.568
But they all stink.

How much did you pay for 'em?

about the first chapter?

# PETERMAN
1132.234
Well, it started out nicely.
1134.088
1134.268
I'm returning some pants,
1137.068
1137.101
a very identifiable problem.
1140.301
1140.334
I set off down a train tunnel.
1142.868
1142.901
Now, that's where the story
takes a most unappealing turn.
1145.868
# ELAINE
1145.901
Oh, no, no, that's where
it gets interesting.
1148.201
1148.234
Don't you see? The-- The train
is bearing down on you,
1151.434
1151.468
you dive into a side tunnel,
1153.968
1154.001
and you run into a whole band
of underground tunnel dwellers.
1158.534
1158.000
**LOL**
# PETERMAN
1158.568
It just seems so clichéd
and obvious.
1161.634
1161.668
It's not interesting writing.
1163.634
# ELAINE
1164.834
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Um...
1167.434
1167.468
How 'bout if instead
of diving from the train,
1171.301
1171.334
you, uh...?
1173.034
1173.068
I don't know.
You-- You slip and
1175.434
1175.468
And fall in some mud and...
1178.801
1178.834
ruin your pants?
1181.001
1181.700
**LOL**
# PETERMAN
1184.834
The very pants I was returning.
1187.301
1187.100
**LOL**
1190.234
That's perfect irony.

# ELAINE

No, no, Mr. Peterman,
1208.268
1208.301
why don't we keep them as a--
As a reference.
1210.401
# PETERMAN
1210.434
Nonsense.
1212.034
1212.068
I have Benes' wonderfully
imaginative mind
1214.401
1214.434
to spin my stories.

You take back your tales,
