I love it when people are complimented
on something that they are wearing...
5.143
5.144
And they accept the compliment
as if it was about them.
7.900
7.500
**LOL**
7.914
Nice tie. Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
10.656
10.893
The compliment is for the tie.
It's not for you. But we take it.
15.739
15.857
And that's the job of clothes.
To get compliments for us.
19.326
19.403
Because it's very hard
to get compliments...
21.709
21.780
based on your human qualities.
Right? Let's face it.
25.332
25.410
No matter how nice you are,
nobody is gonna say;
27.799
27.871
"Hey, nice person."
30.011
30.624
It's much easier to be a bastard and
just try and match the colours up.
34.769
37.700
**LOL**
39.384
Oh, look at this.
42.271
# JERRY
42.346
Boy. Oh, I miss the days when
they made toys that could kill a kid.
45.945
46.300
**LOL**
# ELAINE
47.727
Oh, cool. Look at that.
50.152
# JERRY
50.271
Yeah, I'm right there with you.
52.448
# ELAINE
52.524
That is a Schwinn Sting-Ray.
And it's the girls' model.
57.203
57.279
Oh, I always wanted one
of these when I was little.
60.334
# ELAINE
60.450
What do you think, Jerry?
63.088
# JERRY
# ELAINE
64.162
Jerry. What do you think?
67.133
# JERRY
67.207
Oh, yeah, it would be great
for your paper route.
70.060
# ELAINE
70.127
I love it. I'm getting it.
71.686
# ELAINE
71.796
Can you help me get it down, Jerr?
Jerry.
75.515
# CHRISTIE
75.634
 Your friend needs some help.
77.161
# JERRY
77.161
 The only way to really help her...
78.688
78.762
is to just let her be.
80.689
# ELAINE
89.066
Hey.
90.826
# SUSAN
96.241
 A little baby girl?
97.727
# KEN
97.727
 Doctor says it could be any day now.
99.212
# GEORGE
99.995
So, Carrie, you and Susan
are cousins.
104.307
101.700
**LOL**
104.917
So your baby daughter is gonna be
Susan's second cousin, right?
108.885
108.964
 So, what does that make me?
110.597
# CARRIE
110.597
 it doesn't make you anything.
112.231
# GEORGE
113.052
Well, so, legally, I could
marry your daughter.
116.652
# SUSAN
123.355
So have you picked out a name yet?
125.163
# CARRIE
125.274
Well, we've narrowed
it down to a few.
127.616
127.693
We like Kimberly.
129.074
# SUSAN
# GEORGE
129.362
Oh, boy.
131.835
130.500
**LOL**
# KEN
131.948
You don't like Kimberly?
134.006
# GEORGE
135.494
 What else you got?
136.582
# KEN
136.582
 How about Joan?
137.670
# GEORGE
137.788
 Come on, I'm eating here.
139.042
# SUSAN
139.042
 George.
140.296
# CARRIE
140.416
 Pamela?
141.860
# GEORGE
141.860
 Pamela?
143.304
144.212
All right. I'll tell you what.
145.723
145.798
You look like nice people.
I'm gonna help you out.
148.306
148.250
**LOL**
149.427
You want a beautiful name? Soda.
152.647
# KEN
154.140
 What?
155.002
# GEORGE
155.002
 Soda.
155.865
156.143
S-O-D-A. Soda.
158.236
# CARRIE
158.354
I don't know.
It sounds a little strange.
160.696
# GEORGE
161.232
All names sound strange
the first time you hear them.
164.037
164.110
Are you telling me people
loved the name Blanche...
166.499
166.571
the first time they heard it?
168.960
# KEN
169.074
 Yeah, but Soda?
170.684
# GEORGE
170.684
 Yeah, that's right.
172.294
172.370
 It's working.
173.523
# CARRIE
173.523
 We'll put it on the list.
174.676
# GEORGE
175.415
I solve problems.
That's just what I do.
178.884
# KRAMER
183.424
Yeah, let's look at that boy.
186.098
186.761
That's good.
188.190
# JERRY
188.263
You're going to town with that turkey.
190.071
# KRAMER
190.140
Oh, yeah. I got a big appetite.
192.399
# KRAMER
193.853
Oh, Jerry. You got no mustard.
195.744
# JERRY
195.855
 It's on the door.
197.299
# KRAMER
197.299
 What, this yellow stuff?
198.743
198.600
**LOL**
198.817
No, I said, mustard, Jerry. Dijon.
200.826
# KRAMER
202.279
I still wanna do it.
204.206
205.950
No.
207.509
# KRAMER
209.329
That's bush league. No.
210.757
# JERRY
211.373
Hey, wait. You're just gonna
leave it there?
213.549
213.625
 It's half a pound of turkey.
214.796
# KRAMER
214.796
 I can't eat that.
215.967
216.045
You can't eat a sandwich
without Dijon.
217.972
218.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
218.047
Yeah, you're right. I really should keep
more of your favourites on hand.
221.766
221.250
**LOL**
# KRAMER
222.427
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm getting a vibe here.
226.608
225.800
**LOL**
227.266
What, are you unhappy
with our arrangement?
229.359
# JERRY
230.103
What arrangement?
231.946
# KRAMER
232.063
I was under the impression that
I could take anything I wanted...
235.081
235.150
from your fridge. You take
whatever from mine.
237.409
# JERRY
237.528
Let me know when you get
something in there, and I will.
240.084
240.150
**LOL**
# KRAMER
241.657
 Oh, hey.
242.372
# ELAINE
242.372
 Hey.
243.086
# JERRY
243.159
Hey. What's with your neck?
246.214
# ELAINE
247.080
It's still killing me from having
to get that bike off the wall...
250.881
251.000
**LOL**
250.960
by myself.
252.435
# JERRY
252.628
Well, if it's any consolation,
I did get her number.
255.599
# ELAINE
255.715
I think I really strained it.
257.939
# JERRY
258.010
Oh, I doubt you strained it.
Maybe you pulled it.
260.316
# ELAINE
260.387
 Maybe.
261.267
# JERRY
261.267
 Did you twist it?
262.147
262.223
 You could have twisted it?
263.228
263.450
**LOL**
# ELAINE
263.228
 I don't know.
264.232
# JERRY
264.350
Did you wrench it?
Did you jam it?
266.194
266.269
 Maybe you squeezed it and turned it?
267.547
# ELAINE
267.547
 Why don't you...
268.825
268.897
 just shut the hell up.
270.134
# JERRY
# ELAINE
270.134
 All right.
271.370
272.359
God, man, this is killing me.
274.120
274.195
I would give that bike to the person
who could make this pain go away.
278.127
# KRAMER
278.241
 You're really hurting, huh?
280.498
# ELAINE
280.498
 Oh, Kramer, it's just awful.
282.754
# KRAMER
282.830
Well, you're arterioles
have constricted.
285.088
# KRAMER
285.207
All right, lean forward. Relax.
286.932
# ELAINE
287.001
 What? What?
288.154
# KRAMER
288.154
 Encounter shiatsu.
289.308
# ELAINE
289.379
Wait a minute. You know
what you're doing?
291.472
# KRAMER
291.548
Oh, yeah. A wise man once
taught me the healing power...
295.183
295.261
of the body's
natural pressure points.
297.817
# ELAINE
# KRAMER
297.930
He sells T-shirts near
the World Trade Center.
300.107
300.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
# KRAMER
301.643
He's a genius.
303.118
303.186
Here we go. Here we go.
304.829
# KRAMER
304.897
All right, from pain
will come pleasure.
306.954
309.777
Voilà.
311.336
# KRAMER
# ELAINE
311.988
 Oh, my God.
312.952
# KRAMER
312.952
 Yeah.
313.915
# ELAINE
313.990
Wow, that is unbelievable.
318.041
318.120
That pain is totally gone.
320.509
# JERRY
320.581
What's even more amazing is
his formal training is in paediatrics.
324.514
324.050
**LOL**
# KRAMER
325.086
All right. My work is done here.
326.681
# ELAINE
326.755
Oh, man. Kramer, thank you.
329.062
# KRAMER
329.174
 You can send that bike over any time.
330.577
# ELAINE
330.577
 What?
331.980
331.850
**LOL**
332.428
 What is he talking about?
333.724
# JERRY
333.724
 I don't know.
335.020
335.098
You said you'd give the bike
to whoever fixes your neck.
337.689
# ELAINE
337.809
 You really think he wants the bike?
339.146
# JERRY
339.146
 Oh, yeah.
340.483
# ELAINE
340.563
But it took him like 10 seconds.
342.074
# JERRY
342.189
Well, that's the most he's
worked in the last four months.
345.374
344.450
**LOL**
# GEORGE
349.489
 I think they really went for that Soda.
350.957
# SUSAN
350.957
 What are you, crazy?
352.425
352.493
They hated it.
They were just humouring you.
354.882
# GEORGE
354.954
All right. Very good.
Believe me.
357.261
357.332
 That kid's going to be called Soda.
358.817
359.250
**LOL**
# SUSAN
358.817
 I can tell you...
360.303
360.377
I would never name my child Soda.
362.351
# GEORGE
362.463
Oh, no, no, no.
No, of course not.
364.556
364.632
I got a great name for our kids,
a real original.
367.567
367.677
You wanna hear what it is?
Are you ready?
369.734
# SUSAN
369.804
Yeah.
371.363
372.650
**LOL**
# SUSAN
373.517
 What is that, sign language?
374.943
# GEORGE
374.943
 No.
376.369
376.771
Seven.
378.864
378.650
**LOL**
# SUSAN
378.982
Seven Costanza. You're serious?
381.324
# GEORGE
381.443
Yeah, it's a beautiful name
for a boy or a girl.
384.116
# GEORGE
384.196
 Especially a girl. Or a boy.
385.889
# SUSAN
385.889
 I don't think so.
387.582
386.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
387.700
 What, you don't like the name?
389.500
# SUSAN
389.500
 It's not a name. It's a number.
391.300
# GEORGE
391.412
I know. It's Mickey Mantle's number.
393.589
393.665
So not only is it
an all-around beautiful name...
396.007
396.084
 it is also a living tribute.
397.802
# SUSAN
397.802
 It's awful. I hate it.
399.519
# GEORGE
400.298
 Well, that's the name.
401.807
# SUSAN
401.807
 Oh, no it is not.
403.316
403.426
No child of mine is ever going
to be named Seven.
407.192
405.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
407.306
All right. Let's just
stay calm here.
409.280
409.350
Don't get all crazy on me.
411.906
# JERRY
413.187
Seven? Yeah, I guess
I could see it.
415.280
415.357
Seven. Seven periods of school.
Seven beatings a day.
418.209
419.319
Roughly seven stitches a beating,
and, eventually, seven years to life.
423.038
423.115
You're doing that child
quite a service.
424.924
# GEORGE
425.034
Yes, I am.
426.593
426.661
I defy you to come up
with a better name than Seven.
429.253
# JERRY
429.414
All right. Let's see.
430.973
431.041
How about Mug?
433.300
433.050
**LOL**
433.419
Mug Costanza.
435.595
435.672
That's original.
437.052
437.132
 Ketchup. Pretty name for a girl.
438.683
# GEORGE
438.683
 Right. You having a good time?
440.233
# JERRY
440.302
I got 50 right here in the cupboard.
How about Bisquick?
443.154
443.472
Pimento? Gherkin? Sauce?
447.440
446.150
**LOL**
447.518
 Maxwell House?
449.336
448.550
**LOL**
# GEORGE
449.336
 All right, already.
451.154
451.273
This is a very key issue with me,
Jerry.
453.164
453.233
I had this name for a long time.
454.792
# JERRY
454.860
Oh, I forgot to call Christie.
456.419
# GEORGE
456.529
That's the one you met in the store?
458.207
# JERRY
458.281
She had this great black and white
dress with a scoop neck.
461.133
461.201
She looked like some
kind of superhero.
463.294
462.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
463.579
And you met her in an antique store.
I don't know how you do it.
466.466
# JERRY
466.582
I'm not engaged.
468.176
468.350
**LOL**
# KRAMER
470.837
 I got it.
471.700
# JERRY
471.700
 Got what?
472.562
# KRAMER
472.631
I got the answer, Jerry.
Refrigerator problem is solved.
475.436
# JERRY
475.759
Oh, it's no problem.
You can take whatever you want.
478.148
# KRAMER
478.262
I will. But now I'm accountable.
480.604
480.681
All right, I take what I want. Here.
482.691
# KRAMER
482.767
And I write it down.
484.243
484.311
One cupcake.
486.653
486.730
And then I put it in the bowl.
489.535
489.608
There. Very simple.
491.997
490.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
492.111
 Sort of a mooching inventory.
494.558
# KRAMER
494.558
 No, not mooching.
497.004
497.075
Because at the end of the week
you add them.
499.085
499.161
 And you give me the bill.
500.107
500.107
 All right.
501.053
# JERRY
# KRAMER
501.122
Look, I gotta run some errands.
502.681
502.790
When Elaine comes by with that bike,
hang on to it for me.
505.512
# JERRY
505.627
Kramer, I don't know
if you're getting that bike.
507.850
# KRAMER
507.921
Oh, yes, I am.
We had a verbal contract.
510.939
511.008
If we can't take each other
at our word, all is lost.
514.394
# KRAMER
515.638
Oh, yeah, yeah, put that on my tab.
517.363
517.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
521.395
Well, this is it.
The food is atrocious.
523.867
523.939
But the busboys
are the best in the city.
526.994
527.110
 May I take your coat, miss?
529.200
# CHRISTIE
529.200
 Yes, thank you.
531.290
# GEORGE
539.707
 The same outfit?
540.943
# JERRY
540.943
 The exact same outfit.
542.180
# GEORGE
542.294
 How many days between encounters?
543.530
# JERRY
543.530
 Three.
544.766
# GEORGE
544.838
Three days. Well, maybe you caught
her on the cusp of a new wash cycle.
549.601
549.300
**LOL**
549.969
You know, she did laundry
the day after she met you.
552.358
552.430
Everything got clean.
She started all over again.
554.654
# JERRY
555.142
Possibly. But then shouldn't the outfit
only reappear at the end of the cycle?
560.403
559.250
**LOL**
# GEORGE
560.523
Maybe she moved it up
in the rotation.
562.912
562.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
563.735
Why? It's our first date.
She's already in reruns.
567.418
# GEORGE
568.198
 Very curious.
569.393
# JERRY
569.393
 Indeed.
570.588
# GEORGE
570.701
Einstein wore the exact same outfit
every day.
572.925
# JERRY
573.037
Well, if she splits the atom,
I'll let it slide.
576.092
# GEORGE
577.751
 All right. I'm heading home.

 Did Susan change her mind...
580.556
580.629
 about the name?
581.783
# GEORGE
581.783
 Not yet, but she's weakening.
582.936
# JERRY
583.049
Just because your life is destroyed...
584.809
584.884
don't destroy someone else's.
587.310
# GEORGE
587.429
It's Mickey Mantle, Jerry.
My idol.
590.281
# JERRY
590.349
 How about Mickey?
591.835
591.835
 Mickey?
593.320
593.895
Mickey....
595.786
594.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
# KRAMER
# JERRY
601.612
 ls this your half a can of soda?
603.222
# KRAMER
603.222
 Nope, that's yours.
604.832
604.907
My half is gone.
606.965
# JERRY
609.788
 What?
610.543
# KRAMER
610.543
 Yeah.
611.299
611.415
I put my half a can here in the tab.
614.053
614.126
 Why? What's your beef?
616.198
# JERRY
616.198
 You cannot buy half a can of soda.
618.271
617.150
**LOL**
# KRAMER
618.339
 Well, why not?
619.973
# JERRY
619.973
 I don't wanna get into the physics of it.
621.606
621.676
But you know the sound
a can makes when you open it?
624.268
# KRAMER
624.346
 Yeah.
625.061
# JERRY
625.061
 That is the sound...
625.775
625.700
**LOL**
625.848
of you buying a whole can.
627.692
627.767
And the same goes for this.
Okay?
631.402
# JERRY
631.479
When you pierce the skin of a piece
of fruit, you've bought the whole fruit.
635.163
635.234
Not a third of an apple.
Not a half of a banana.
637.872
637.945
 All right.
638.891
# KRAMER
# JERRY
638.891
 You bite it, you bought it.
639.837
# KRAMER
639.947
All right. I'll make
the necessary adjustments.
642.336
642.409
 All right.
643.413
# JERRY
643.413
 Thank you.

# KRAMER
644.494
Oh, so how's the neck?
647.050
646.200
**LOL**
647.164
Nice and loose?
648.545
# ELAINE
648.666
Lookit, Kramer, you are
not getting this bike.
651.055
651.127
I don't even know why you want it.
I mean, it's a girls' bike.
654.513
# KRAMER
654.589
It's a verbal contract.
We had a deal.
656.682
# ELAINE
656.800
No, we didn't.
658.181
658.260
You take these things too literally.
659.938
660.012
It's like saying you're hungry
enough to eat horse.
663.482
# KRAMER
663.600
Well my friend Jay Riemenschneider
eats horse all the time.
666.903
666.978
He gets it from his butcher.
669.534
669.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
669.606
This is not the point.
671.201
671.275
The point is,
you just can't have the bike.
674.910
# KRAMER
674.988
Boy, I am really surprised at you.
677.413
677.490
You are the last person I figured
would do something like this.
680.758
680.869
I mean, George, yeah, I can see that.
Even Jerry.
684.505
# KRAMER
684.916
But not you, Elaine.
I always put you up here.
688.717
# KRAMER
688.795
They're over here.
691.303
691.381
Now you're all;
695.182
692.050
**LOL**
# ELAINE
# KRAMER
# GEORGE
699.724
 All right.
701.583
701.583
 Yeah.
703.443
704.250
**LOL**
706.941
Come on. It's a fantastic name.
709.532
709.652
It's a real original. Nobody else is
gonna have it. And I absolutely love it.
713.288
# SUSAN
713.407
Well, I don't know how original
it's gonna be.
715.500
# GEORGE
716.035
 Why not?
717.313
# SUSAN
717.313
 Well, I was telling Carrie...
718.591
718.663
about our argument. And when l
told them the name, they just loved it.
722.132
722.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
723.168
 So, what are you saying?
724.861
# SUSAN
724.861
 They're naming their baby Seven.
726.554
726.850
**LOL**
# GEORGE
727.840
What? They're stealing the name?
729.980
730.051
That's my name. I made it up.
731.431
# SUSAN
731.552
I can't believe they're using it.
733.230
# GEORGE
733.346
Now, it's not gonna be original.
735.071
735.140
It's gonna lose all its cachet.
736.818
# SUSAN
736.892
I don't know how much
cachet it had to begin with.
739.151
739.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
739.270
Oh, it's got cachet, baby.
740.864
740.938
It's got cachet up the ying-yang.
743.826
# ELAINE
749.239
Oh, God.

Excuse me, Elaine.

Over here.

I thought that was you.
You're Jerry's friend.

Yeah. Yeah.
779.072

780.616
# CHRISTIE

 Yes, how you doing?
782.084
# ELAINE

I'm fine.
784.002
# CHRISTIE
784.071
Well, I gotta run.
It was good to see you.
786.413
# ELAINE
786.532
Okay. It was good to....
789.302
789.369
Good to see you.
791.343
791.350
**LOL**
792.456
 Looking good.

 Hey, you're riding a girls' bike.
799.239
# ELAINE
799.239

 Hello.

# GEORGE
806.833
 Hello, Ken.
807.820
807.890
It's George Costanza.
810.149
810.226
I think we need to talk.
812.283
812.150
**LOL**
# ELAINE(O.C.): 
813.772
Kramer.
815.532
# ELAINE
816.859
 Kramer!
818.030
# JERRY
818.030
 Hey.
819.201
# ELAINE
819.278
God. Is Kramer back
from his little joyride yet?
822.379
# JERRY
822.699
 Haven't seen him. How's the neck?
824.558
# ELAINE
824.558
 His chiropractic job was a crock.
826.417
826.495
I mean, it's even worse
than it was before.
829.003
# JERRY
829.123
I'd think Kramer
would have a knack...
831.014
831.083
for moving a person's spine
around.
833.141
834.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
834.545
Hey, you know what?
836.104
836.172
I think I ran into that girl
from the antique store.
838.598
838.675
 What's her name, Christie?
840.368
# JERRY
840.368
 You saw her? What was she wearing?
842.061
841.150
**LOL**
# ELAINE
843.681
I don't know. I couldn't see.
I couldn't look down...
846.533
846.601
 because of my neck.
847.879
# JERRY
847.879
 Didn't you get a glimpse?
849.157
849.229
 An impression?
850.175
# ELAINE
850.175
 What do you care?
851.121
# JERRY
851.231
Both times I've seen her,
she's worn the same dress.
853.620
855.150
**LOL**
# ELAINE
858.198
 Did you have a nice ride?
859.582
# KRAMER
859.582
 Oh, great ride.
860.967
# ELAINE
861.034
Oh, that's good,
because it was your last.
864.136
# KRAMER
866.207
What are you talking about?
We had a deal.
868.181
# ELAINE
868.293
You gotta give me back that bike.
Look at this! Look!
871.429
871.505
I couldn't even crawl
out of bed this morning.
873.597
# KRAMER
873.674
Bed? You should be sleeping on
a wooden board for at least a week.
876.894
# ELAINE
877.011
 What? You never told me that.
878.811
# KRAMER
878.811
 Well, it's common sense.
880.611
# ELAINE
880.682
What is he talking about?
He's being ridiculous.
883.024
# KRAMER
883.101
Look, Jerry, you know
the whole story.
884.861
884.937
 You should settle this.
885.716
# ELAINE
885.716
 Yeah.
886.496
# JERRY
886.563
I'm flattered you'd
appeal to my wisdom.
888.491
888.566
But, unfortunately,
my friendship to each of you...
890.991
891.069
precludes my getting involved.
893.078
893.000
**LOL**
893.154
What you need is
an impartial mediator.
895.662
# ELAINE
895.782
Yeah, I'd go for that.
Would you go for that?
898.374
# KRAMER
898.452
All right, I'm down.
900.510
899.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
900.955
It would have to be someone
who hasn't heard the story.
903.511
903.583
Someone who is unencumbered
by any emotional attachment.
906.803
906.878
Someone whose heart is so dark...
908.521
908.589
it cannot be swayed by pity, emotion
or human compassion of any kind.
912.817
912.250
**LOL**
# ELAINE
913.302
So that's the situation.
915.111
916.400
**LOL**
# NEWMAN
916.598
You present an interesting dilemma.
919.948
919.600
**LOL**
920.644
Each of you seemingly
has a legitimate claim to the bicycle.
924.161
924.398
And yet the bicycle can have
only one rightful owner.
928.995
929.071
Quite the conundrum.
931.377
931.782
As a federal employee,
I believe the law is all we have.
935.334
935.411
It's all that separates us
from the savages...
937.718
937.789
who don't deserve
the privilege of mail.
939.882
939.958
Stuffing parcels in mailboxes,
where they don't belong.
942.466
# KRAMER
942.586
Newman!
944.430
943.550
**LOL**
# NEWMAN
948.259
But you must promise
that you will abide by my decision...
953.022
951.350
**LOL**
953.098
no matter how unjust
it may seem to either of you.
957.243
957.311
Do I have your word?
959.404
# KRAMER
959.480
 All right, yeah.
960.485
# ELAINE
960.485
 Yeah.
961.490
# NEWMAN
961.566
All right. Let's begin.

Why can't we use Seven?

It's my name. I made it up.
You can't just steal it.
973.467
# CARRIE
973.580
Well, it's not as if Susan's pregnant.
975.756
975.832
You already postponed the wedding.
Who knows if you'll get married.
978.850
# GEORGE
978.961
Hey, hey, don't worry about me.
I'm not a waffler. I don't waffle.
982.395
979.600
**LOL**
# KEN
982.465
Look, we're both big
Mickey Mantle fans.
984.558
984.634
And we love the name.
It's very unusual.
986.526
# GEORGE
986.595
What happened to Soda?
I thought we all agreed on Soda.
989.365
988.100

 We don't care for Soda.
990.727

990.727
 You don't care for Soda?
991.981
# CARRIE
992.101
No, no. We don't like Soda at all.

How do you not like Soda?
It's bubbly. It's refreshing.
997.324
# CARRIE

997.399
 What is it?
998.137

 Are you okay?
999.929
# CARRIE
999.929
 I'm going into labour.

Oh, God. Okay, let's not panic.
Let's just get to the hospital.
1004.004
# CARRIE
1004.073
 Okay.
1005.351
# KEN
1005.351
 I got the suitcase packed right here.
1006.629
1006.701
 Let's go.
1007.812

1007.812
 What about Six?
1008.924
1009.500

1009.413

Thirteen is no good.
1011.802

# CHRISTIE
1019.549
Are you okay, Jerry?
You seem quiet.
1022.057
# JERRY
1022.428
No, I'm just a little worn-out.
1025.149
# CHRISTIE
1025.264
 I know exactly what you mean.
1026.999
# JERRY
1026.999
 Oh, I'm sure you do.
1028.734
1028.852
What in God's name
is going on here?
1031.324
1031.396
Is she wearing the same thing
over and over again?
1033.785
1033.857
Or does she have a closet full
of these like Superman?
1036.531
1036.610
I've got to unlock this mystery.
1039.000
# CHRISTIE
1039.072
Oh, my God.
1041.330
# JERRY
# CHRISTIE
1042.325
I can't go to the movies like this.
1045.343
1043.200

1046.455
Do you mind if we go back
to my apartment so I can change?
1049.093

Change? Yes, I think
that's a super idea.

# GEORGE
1060.721
You know, the thing is, I kind
of promised the widow Mantle...
1065.034
1065.101
that I would name my baby Seven.
1067.159
1065.700
**LOL**
# KEN
1067.229
Now's not the best time, George.
1069.951

It's just that I know her.
And, boy...
1073.658
# KEN
1073.736
George, she's in labour.
1075.794

# NEWMAN
1081.662
Well, you both presented
very convincing arguments.
1087.006
1087.252
On the one hand, Elaine...
1089.559
1089.630
your promise was given in haste.
1092.268
1092.383
But was it not still a promise?
1094.772
1094.900
**LOL**
# NEWMAN
1096.429
And, Kramer, you did provide a
service in exchange for compensation.
1100.990
1101.059
But does the fee, once paid,
not entitle the buyer...
1104.944
1105.022
to some assurance
of reliability?
1108.539
1110.100
**LOL**
1110.700
**LOL**
1110.445
These were not easy questions
to answer.
1114.840
1114.909
Not for any man.
1116.420
# NEWMAN
1116.827
But I have made a decision.
1119.597
1119.998
We will cut the bike
down the middle...
1123.467
1123.350
**LOL**
1123.543
and give half to each of you.
1125.636
# ELAINE
1125.754
What? This is your solution?
1127.978
1128.049
To ruin the bike?
1129.940
# ELAINE
1130.009
All right. Fine, fine. Go ahead.
1132.601
1132.679
 Cut the stupid thing in half.
1134.229
# KRAMER
1134.229
 No, no, no. Give it to her.
1135.780
1135.849
I'd rather it belong to another
than see it destroyed.
1138.357
1138.436
Newman, give it to her.
I beg you.
1140.445
# ELAINE
1140.521
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1142.321
# NEWMAN

 Not so fast, Elaine.
1144.121
1144.192
Only the bike's true owner...
1146.036
1146.111
would rather give it away
than see it come to harm.
1149.082
1146.900
**LOL**
1149.156
 Kramer, the bike is yours.

# KRAMER
1151.951
Sweet justice.
Newman, you are wise.
1155.218
1155.150
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1155.288
But this isn't fair.
1156.847
1156.957
Lookit, my neck is still hurting me.
And now you have the bike?
1160.343
# KRAMER
1160.461
Well, tell it to the judge, honey.
1162.139
1162.200
**LOL**
1162.713
I'm going for a ride.

Here we are.

# JERRY
1168.303
So this is the fortress of solitude.
1171.523
# CHRISTIE
1172.558
Well, I guess I'll go change.
1174.152
# JERRY
1174.268
Yes, change. By all means, change.
1178.367
1190.579
August 17th, 1992.
1192.422
1192.539
The same dress.
1194.182
1194.250
She never changes. Oh, my God.
1197.517
1196.250
**LOL**
1197.712
She's gotta have hundreds
of these dresses.
1200.220
1200.298
There must be a secret stash
around here somewhere.
1203.353
1206.450
**LOL**
# CHRISTIE
1208.474
 Are you looking for something?
1209.876
# JERRY
1209.876
 I thought you were changing.
1211.279
# CHRISTIE
1211.394
You know, maybe we should
just call it a night.
1213.986
# JERRY
1214.106
No, no, no. Come on.
Put something else on.
1216.531
1215.800
**LOL**
1216.608
It's early. Let's go out.
1218.167
# CHRISTIE
1218.527
I think I'm just gonna go to bed.
1220.916
# JERRY
1222.115
You know, I'm kind of tired myself.
I'll just sleep here on the couch.
1225.964
1223.700
**LOL**
1226.036
In the morning, we'll walk out together.
Both dressed, different clothes.
1229.671
1229.790
I'll be in the same clothes.
1231.171
1231.250
You'll be in different clothes,
as it's your place.
1233.592
1233.670
We'll go down. Me in my same
clothes, you in different clothes.
1236.557
# CHRISTIE
1236.673
Jerry, I don't think so.
1238.731
# JERRY
1240.594
 Wanna throw something on,
walk me...
1242.355
1242.600
**LOL**
1242.471
 to a cab?
1243.209
# CHRISTIE
1243.209
 Get out.
1243.947
# JERRY
1244.015
Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow.
I'll help you lay it out on the bed.

 Okay, breathe, honey. Breathe.

# GEORGE
1251.548
 You're really being very selfish.
1253.200
1252.550
**LOL**
1253.317
Be nice if you'd think
of someone other than yourself.

 You're not getting Seven.
1258.251

 Now, get out of here.

Hello, Christie. I was wondering
if we could get together again.
1274.145
1274.341
Oh, really?
1276.019
1276.093
You can't break up
with me over the phone.
1278.233
1278.346
You gotta do this in person.
It doesn't have to be one-on-one.
1281.198
1281.266
Bring a group of friends.
I just wanna see you.
1283.442
1282.900
**LOL**
1283.519
Don't hang up on me. Why do you
always wear the same dress? Hello?
1287.118
# KRAMER
1288.900
Jerry, if you're gonna be
snacking on these...
1291.158
1291.236
you can't expect me to pay
for the whole box.
1293.494
# JERRY
1293.905
All right, Hobo Joe.
1296.212
1295.700
**LOL**
1297.201
I didn't wanna put a damper
on your smorgasbord.
1299.543
1299.620
But it's the end of the week,
so I added up your tab.
1302.924
# KRAMER
# JERRY
1304.501
I know, pretty steep.
1306.428
1305.300
**LOL**
# KRAMER
1306.503
Well, I don't have this kind of cash.
1308.347
# JERRY
1308.464
 Few do.
1310.074
# KRAMER
1310.074
 I'm good for it.
1311.684
# JERRY
1311.801
Yeah, well, until this bill is paid,
the food court is closed.
1315.152
# JERRY
1315.222
Closed? All right.
1318.027

I'll get that money for you in five
minutes. And don't eat any more.

 This is my bike.

# NEWMAN
1331.740
Oh, no. No, no, no.
I bought it from Kramer.
1334.628
1334.994
He was hard up for cash.
1336.672
1336.746
Fifty bucks. Can you believe it?
1339.468
1340.083
I had to make some
minor modifications.
1342.010
1341.800
**LOL**
1342.294
Solid tires, reinforced seat post...
1344.471
1344.589
heavy-duty shocks.
But, baby, this is one sweet ride.
1348.058
# ELAINE

No, you gotta give me back that bike.
