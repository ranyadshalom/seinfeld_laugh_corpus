Maura, I want you to know,
I've given this a lot of thought.
7.503
7.676
I'm sorry, but we have to break up.
11.306
# MAURA
12.081
No.
13.480
13.350
**LOL**
# GEORGE
17.087
What's that?
18.538
# MAURA
18.538
We're not breaking up.
19.989
19.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
22.594
We're not?
23.720
# MAURA
24.196
No.
25.858
30.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
32.272
All right.
33.762
33.500
**LOL**
38.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
39.247
She said no?
40.413
# GEORGE
40.413
She said no.
41.579
# JERRY
41.749
What did you do?
42.909
# GEORGE
43.318
What could I do?
45.014
45.187
We fooled around
and went to a movie.
47.712
47.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
48.390
George, both parties don't have
to consent to a breakup.
51.417
51.595
It's not like you're launching missiles
and you both have to turn your keys.
55.258
56.567
You didn't make a convincing case.
Let me hear your arguments.
59.934
# GEORGE
60.104
Well, I don't really like her.
61.254
# JERRY
61.254
That's good.
62.403
# GEORGE
62.574
I don't find her attractive.
63.654
# JERRY
63.654
Solid.
64.735
# GEORGE
64.910
I'd like to sleep with other women.
66.241
# JERRY
66.241
Always popular.
67.572
# GEORGE
67.747
Sometimes at restaurants
she talks to her food.
70.648
70.817
"Oh, Mr. Mashed Potatoes,
you are so good."
73.615
73.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
74.121
You have an airtight case.
75.315
# GEORGE
75.489
And in bed--
76.803
# JERRY
76.803
I'm afraid we're out of time.
78.117
# JERRY
80.595
Hey.
81.090
# GEORGE
81.090
What?
81.584
# JERRY
81.763
Check these out.
These are Jerry Lewis' old cufflinks...
84.561
84.733
...that he wore
in the movie Cinderfella.
86.599
86.769
I got them at an auction.
87.963
# GEORGE
88.137
I got some cufflinks
I could have loaned you.
90.571
90.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
90.740
Jerry Lewis is gonna be
at this Friars Club roast I'm going to.
93.539
93.710
Now I have an in to strike up
a conversation.
95.769
# GEORGE
96.446
You already have an in.
98.142
98.316
You have the same first name.
101.217
101.753
Jerry.
103.618
103.150
**LOL**
# JERRY
104.490
Oh, that'll intrigue him.
105.923
# GEORGE
106.792
Well, it worked when I met
George Peppard last week.
110.229
# JERRY
111.598
George Peppard
has been dead for years.
114.590
# GEORGE
115.368
Well, whoever he was,
he knew a lot about The A-Team.
119.032
118.250
**LOL**
# GLENN
119.840
So you would choose your last meal
based on the method of execution?
122.901
# ELAINE
123.078
Right, if I was getting the chair...
124.909
125.080
...I'd go for something hot and spicy,
you know?
127.310
127.482
Thai, maybe Mexican.
130.452
131.054
Lethal injection, feels like pasta.
133.488
133.656
You know, it's painless,
I don't want anything too heavy.
136.649
# GLENN
136.827
So why don't we
get together some time?
139.295
# ELAINE
139.463
Oh, sure. Why don't you give me
your number?
141.557
# GLENN
141.733
I think it'd be better if I called you.
143.633
# ELAINE
143.802
Oh, okay. Maybe we could grab
some lunch sometime.
146.795
146.973
Do you work around here or...?
148.503
# GLENN
148.503
No, not really.
150.033
# ELAINE
150.676
So is there anything
you can tell me about yourself?
153.339
# GLENN
153.780
I think you're very beautiful.
155.338
157.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
156.650
That'll do.
158.118
# JERRY
160.521
What about Puddy?
161.545
# ELAINE
161.723
I haven't talked to him
in like three weeks.
164.090
164.259
I think it might be over.
166.022
166.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
168.130
So, what's this guy about?
169.512
# ELAINE
169.512
I don't know.
170.895
171.067
He wouldn't tell me his phone number,
where he worked.
174.525
174.771
I'll bet he's in a relationship.
177.536
# JERRY
177.708
Or he's a crime fighter
safeguarding his secret identity.
180.677
180.800
**LOL**
181.747
Elaine, you could be dating
the Green Lantern.
183.772
# ELAINE
184.983
Which one is he?
186.280
# JERRY
186.280
Green suit, power ring.
187.577
# ELAINE
187.754
I don't care for jewelry on men.
189.847
189.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
190.857
Hey, it happened again.
193.621
193.794
Another robbery in the building.
195.455
# JERRY
195.629
So you bought a cooler?
197.654
197.150
**LOL**
# KRAMER
198.432
No, it's a strongbox
to protect my irreplaceables.
201.596
# ELAINE
201.770
And what would those be?
204.034
# KRAMER
204.205
Some taxidermy that's been
in my family for generations.
207.607
206.900
**LOL**
207.777
My Tony, my military discharge.
210.940
# JERRY
211.113
You were in the Army?
212.411
# KRAMER
213.483
Briefly.
214.973
214.800
**LOL**
215.385
Now, I gotta find a good place
to hide this key...
217.946
218.122
...because if somebody finds this, they
hold the key to all my possessions.
221.717
# ELAINE
221.893
Literally.
223.310
223.310
Literally?
224.727
# KRAMER
224.897
What's that supposed to mean?
226.956
226.900
**LOL**
228.634
You mind if I hide this somewhere?
229.732
# JERRY
229.732
No, go ahead.
230.830
233.450
**LOL**
# KRAMER
236.377
A little privacy, huh?
237.674
# JERRY
237.674
Oh, come on.
238.971
# ELAINE
# KRAMER
239.146
Come on, this is a security issue.
240.807
241.582
You wouldn't last
a day in the Army.
243.210
# JERRY
243.385
How long did you last?
245.433
245.800
**LOL**
# KRAMER
245.433
Well, that's classified.
247.481
# ELAINE
248.624
Hey, what if he's married?
250.751
# JERRY
250.927
Kramer?
252.457
252.350
**LOL**
# ELAINE
252.457
No, the Green Lantern.
253.988
# KRAMER
# JERRY
254.431
Okay.
255.455
256.667
So you would date a married guy?
258.862
259.036
That's so hacky.
260.504
# ELAINE
260.672
Well, I don't know. I may never marry.
262.663
262.841
This might be the closest I get.
265.640
267.650
**LOL**
# KRAMER
269.448
You peeked.
270.437
# JERRY
270.616
This is your hiding place?
273.017
# KRAMER
274.354
It was under a spoon.
276.151
# GEORGE
279.193
And so, for all these reasons,
we are officially broken up.
283.961
284.350
**LOL**
284.600
Thank you and good night.
288.195
# MAURA
288.770
No, George, we're not.
290.204
290.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
290.840
But I proved it.
292.205
# MAURA
292.375
I refuse to give up
on this relationship.
294.343
294.511
It's like launching missiles
from a submarine.
297.310
297.481
Both of us have to turn our keys.
299.415
299.850
**LOL**
# GEORGE
301.418
Well, then I am gonna have
to ask you to turn your key.
305.321
# MAURA
305.790
I'm sorry, George. I can't do that.
307.588
308.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
308.528
Turn your key, Maura.
Turn your key.
312.157
# ELAINE
315.135
So how is a guy like you
not involved?
317.933
# GLENN
318.105
I might ask you the same thing.
319.903
# ELAINE
320.308
That's true.
Maybe he's not married.
321.866
322.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
323.244
Oh, that is so sweet.
326.180
326.550
**LOL**
# ELAINE
326.348
How long do I have to hold this?
328.714
# GLENN
331.120
Oh, no.
332.435
# ELAINE
332.435
Who is it?
333.749
# GLENN
333.924
No one. No one.
335.687
337.260
Here, let me show you a shortcut.
Come on.
339.559
# ELAINE
339.730
Married. That's it,
I'm chucking the flower.
343.792
345.050
**LOL**
# ELAINE
346.205
Jerry. Jerry!
349.937
# JERRY
350.109
Elaine, what are you doing
down there?
352.134
# ELAINE
352.312
You didn't hear me buzzing?
354.143
# JERRY
354.981
Oh, I guess it's broken.
356.609
# ELAINE
357.284
Throw down your key.
358.774
# JERRY
358.953
It's liable to bounce
and go into a sewer.
361.421
# ELAINE
361.590
I'll catch it.
362.955
# JERRY
363.124
You'll chicken out
at the last second.
365.490
# ELAINE
366.161
Yeah, you're right.
367.925
368.998
Well, will you at least keep me
company until somebody comes out?
372.627
# JERRY
373.169
All right.
374.262
378.709
Hey, you know what's weird?
381.440
# ELAINE
# JERRY
381.613
I used to be able to have
a huge meal and go right to sleep.
384.776
384.949
I can't anymore.
386.645
# ELAINE
386.819
Nodding off!
388.309
389.855
Well, I was right. He's an adulterer.
393.656
393.827
And he's cheating on his wife
with me.
396.955
397.999
We haven't done anything yet.
400.365
402.069
I'm hungry.
Can you throw something down?
405.972
405.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
# JERRY
406.141
All right. Here.
I'm gonna try and fix the buzzer.
410.738
# ELAINE
412.382
It went in the sewer.
414.782
413.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
422.127
Hey.
422.906
422.650
**LOL**
# KRAMER
422.906
What are you doing?
423.685
# JERRY
424.796
You jammed your key in here.
You shorted out my intercom.
428.563
# KRAMER
428.734
You just had to go looking for it,
didn't you?
431.032
431.203
See, you hate it that I have
a little secret.
433.194
433.372
Anything I do,
you gotta know all about it.
436.934
436.450
**LOL**
437.110
You're so obsessed with me.
439.078
# JERRY
439.947
I'm gonna go let Elaine in.
441.312
# KRAMER
441.482
What are you doing with her?
443.074
443.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
446.789
Kramer.
448.336
# KRAMER
448.336
Security issue.
449.883
# JERRY
450.859
Oh, hey, you got in.
451.639
# ELAINE
451.639
Yeah.
452.418
452.595
Flirted with the menu guy. Here.
454.046
# JERRY
454.046
Oh, thanks.
455.496
454.850
**LOL**
# KRAMER
455.665
That wasn't me.
458.157
457.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
459.570
So he's definitely married, huh?
461.060
# ELAINE
# JERRY
462.273
Boy, I would loved to have been there
when you told him off.
465.209
467.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
467.746
Oh, come on.
468.906
# ELAINE
469.081
Well, he could be a superhero.
You should have seen him run.
472.415
472.950
**LOL**
# KRAMER
# KRAMER
473.052
Okay.
474.713
476.256
All right, Jerry. Let's see
if you can get it in your head...
478.986
479.159
...that this is not an Easter egg hunt
for your childish amusement.
483.790
482.750
**LOL**
# GEORGE
483.965
Jerry.
485.592

I'll come down.

I believe this belongs to you.

# KRAMER
# JERRY
512.198
Where did you get that?
513.460

I bought it.

515.500
**LOL**
# PHIL
518.439
Thanks.
519.423
# JERRY
519.423
I'm sorry.
520.407
520.574
I don't know you.
521.506
# PHIL
521.506
What?
522.439
# JERRY
522.610
There's have been some robberies
in the building. I can't let you in.
526.308
# PHIL
526.481
But I live here. I ran out to buy some
bird seed and I forgot my key.
530.145
# GEORGE
530.319
Sounds like a scam.
532.480
531.950
**LOL**
# JERRY
533.256
I'm very sorry.
535.657
# GEORGE
539.363
So I broke up with Maura.
It's done. I'm out.
541.525
# JERRY
541.699
Great.
You're lonely and miserable again.
543.496
# GEORGE
543.668
It feels right.
545.033
544.650
**LOL**
# JERRY
546.004
Is that guy still there?
548.166
# GEORGE
548.340
He's staring at us.
549.990
# JERRY
549.990
Don't look at him.
551.639
# JERRY
552.778
We don't hear that.
554.508
554.350
**LOL**
# GEORGE
556.550
Want a bite?

# JERRY
558.251
No, I don't.
559.952
559.450
**LOL**
# GEORGE
564.792
That ginger ale at the coffee shop is
just Coke and Sprite mixed together.
568.456
568.630
How can I prove it?
570.222
570.399
Damn it, I can't. Damn it.

# GEORGE
583.315
What? Maura,
what are you doing here?
585.681
585.851
I ended this relationship twice.
588.649
# MAURA
588.820
George, you didn't mean that.
That was just a fight.
591.881
# GEORGE
593.326
Why does it always seem like I'm
the only one working at this breakup?
597.855
597.400
**LOL**
# MAURA
598.031
George, I listened
to your arguments...
600.056
600.234
...and they were rambling and flimsy.
I'm not convinced.
603.432
603.000
**LOL**

Come on, get dressed
and let's get some dinner.

622.493
So this is your little love nest?
624.927
# GLENN
625.864
It's nothing special,
just a little place I keep.
628.264
# ELAINE
# GLENN
630.168
Should I light a fire?
632.262
# ELAINE
632.438
That sounds romantic.
634.906
# GLENN
635.074
I'm having a little problem
with the heat.
636.905
637.076
I got some cardboard out here.
639.409
# ELAINE
640.147
This is wrong. I should go.
643.549
# GLENN
644.553
Can you get that, please?

# ELAINE
645.986
Oh, sure.
647.420
# WOMAN
650.760
Where's Glenn?
652.387
# ELAINE
652.562
You're the woman from the street,
and I am so sorry.
655.532
655.699
You know, I'm not really
a homewrecker.
658.725

I thought he was a superhero.
I swear.

# WOMAN
662.473
Lady, I'm not his wife.
I'm his welfare caseworker.
665.636
665.810
Is he home?
667.278
# ELAINE
667.446
This is his home?
668.794

668.794
Yes.
670.142
669.650

# JERRY
716.536
So I guess I'll
717.525
# ELAINE
726.247
He wouldn't give me his number,
because he doesn't have a phone.
729.684
729.852
He's not married. He's poor.
734.222
733.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
734.658
Is he wretchedly poor?
736.421
737.661
Does he wear one of those barrels
with the straps?
740.995
740.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
743.034
He probably busted it up
and burned it for heat.

# JERRY
747.506
So when are you giving Boxcar Willie
his walking papers?

How can I end it over money?
I feel bad.
754.410
# JERRY
754.580
Well, let's think.
755.877
756.049
Have you dealt with the poor
in any other situation?
758.382
# ELAINE
758.552
Yes. There was this homeless guy...
760.383
760.554
...who used to urinate
on our garbage cans.
762.886
762.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
763.057
Good. How did you handle that?
764.923
# ELAINE
765.593
We gave him a few bucks.
767.220
767.395
He goes in the alley
across the street.
769.090
# JERRY
769.265
Same situation.
Pay him off and you're clean.
771.859
# ELAINE
772.034
Well, I am not paying Glenn off
to get out of this relationship.
776.870
777.040
What am I supposed to do?
778.234
778.408
Just walk into his hovel
and hand him
781.674
781.846
Well, how much do you think
it would be?
784.280
784.000

Hey, where have you been?
787.282
# GEORGE
787.453
Seeing Maura.
789.080

Apparently, I was unable to break up
beyond a reasonable doubt.
793.419
792.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
794.394
If only he could have been
cheating on his wife.
796.658
796.830
You know, things would have been
so much simpler.

# GEORGE
799.133
Who's this? Blue Arrow?
800.367
800.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
800.367
Green Lantern.
801.601
# JERRY
801.769
We found out his superpower
was lack of money.
805.102
804.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
805.273
All right.
807.002
# JERRY

He's invulnerable to creditors.
808.731
# ELAINE
808.910
We get it.

810.275
He's the Got-No-Green Lantern.

# ELAINE
812.148
Thank you.

813.549
Hey, Elaine.
Maybe his girlfriend is Lois Loan.
817.145
818.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
818.255
Well crafted.
819.813
# GEORGE
820.424
Hey, maybe this cheating thing
is what I could use to ditch Maura.
823.724
# JERRY
823.895
Tell Maura you're having an affair.
826.176
# GEORGE
826.176
She's like a district attorney.
828.457
828.633
If it's not the truth,
I'll break under the cross.
831.626
830.900
**LOL**
831.804
I actually have to do it.
834.136

Could you move over there?
837.368

# GEORGE
842.416
Hey, there's this secretary at work
that always had a crush on me.
845.783
# JERRY
845.953
How come you never
pursued her before?
847.717
# GEORGE
848.323
She's too tan.
849.790
849.958
It's the middle of the winter,
she's like a carrot.
852.859
# ELAINE
853.563
Did I leave my glasses?
854.797
# JERRY
854.797
He can wipe out his account...
856.031
856.199
...in a single bounce.
857.348
857.350
**LOL**
857.348
Keep them.
858.497
866.478
There's a giant parrot
in the hallway.
869.413
869.581
It's Phil's.
870.281
# ELAINE
870.281
Who?
870.980
871.150
Our neighbor
that you turned against.
873.482
873.650
**LOL**
874.987
I told him it would be fine...
876.545
876.722
...if he wanted to let it stretch its wings
in the hallway.
879.317
879.493
What did you tell him that for?
880.983
881.161
Since you've been playing
God with the front door...
883.460
883.631
...I've been trying
to smooth things out, Jerry.
886.065
886.234
I was just hanging out at his place.
887.731
887.731
Really? What's it like?
889.227
889.405
Is it nicer?
Where does he have the couch?
891.498
891.550
**LOL**
891.674
Well, I don't know,
but the key problem is solved.
894.006
894.176
I hid it at Phil's.
895.007
895.007
He let you?
895.838
896.012
No, he doesn't know.
See, I hid it without telling him.
899.448
899.616
So Phil won't be compulsively
looking for it like some people.
904.213

But I don't wanna spoil things

I know we got off to kind
of a bad start, but your bird...
1026.553
1026.731
...which is lovely, by the way,
made a mess on my door.
1031.101
1031.536
And?

I thought maybe you'd clean it up
or your maid there.

of Godspell with the other.

would lose them.

And who buries a bird?
1134.550
# KRAMER
1134.723
Yeah, just give it
to the Portuguese guy...
1136.749
1135.250

...and he puts it in the incinerator.
1139.451

Just get the key
and let's get out of here.
