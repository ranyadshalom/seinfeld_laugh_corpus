 I wouldn't walk over there.
5.453
# JERRY
5.453
 Why not?
6.618
# KRAMER
6.691
Because it's the most dangerous part
of the sidewalk.
9.191
9.260
A cab hops a curb:
10.987
11.062
You've had your last egg sandwich.
13.323
# JERRY
13.397
What about over there? You know,
air conditioners fall out all the time.
17.058
# KRAMER
17.135
I'd much rather get hit by an 80-pound
air conditioner than a two-ton cab.
21.171
# JERRY
21.239
No, no, cab's coming up right here.
23.864
23.941
Set of plastic hips, prosthetic legs...
25.770
25.000
**LOL**
25.843
a monkey to answer the phone,
I'm back in business.
28.377
# KRAMER
28.446
I'd much rather take one in the head,
like I did in '79.
33.040
# JERRY
33.651
You were living
in the Village then, right?
36.185
# KRAMER
36.788
I don't really remember.
39.152
44.850
**LOL**
# ELAINE
47.131
Toxic-waste green.
49.256
49.450
**LOL**
# JERRY
49.333
That is disgusting.
51.128
# ELAINE
51.202
You know, revulsion has now become
a valid form of attraction.
54.829
# JERRY
54.906
Well, then, you're driving me wild.
57.304
56.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
57.742
I had them done for
the big Peterman bash I'm throwing.
60.276
# JERRY
60.344
Why are you having a party?
61.741
# ELAINE
61.813
Oh, I drive my people hard,
and then I reward them.
65.178
# JERRY
65.249
 Like with dogs.
66.380
# ELAINE
66.380
 Yeah, exactly.
67.510
67.850
**LOL**
# GEORGE
67.585
Party?
69.084
# ELAINE
69.587
 Yeah.
70.803
# GEORGE
70.803
 Food?
72.019
# ELAINE
# GEORGE
72.757
 Bar?
73.757
# ELAINE
73.757
 Yeah.
74.757
# GEORGE
74.826
George?
76.553
77.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
78.095
He's gonna show up anyway.
80.095
# ELAINE
80.164
George, I just don't
want you interfering.
82.323
# GEORGE
82.400
How could I possibly interfere?
84.559
# JERRY
84.635
Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?
86.635
86.750
**LOL**
92.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
92.944
These are fantastic. Fantastic.
95.604
95.680
You know, I'd love to get a jump
on the next batch.
98.044
98.115
Where do you come out of?
99.944
101.550
**LOL**
103.855
She's been ignoring this section
all evening.
107.413
108.693
 Quesadilla?
109.875
# ANNA
109.875
 No thanks.
111.057
# GEORGE
112.430
 Hi, my name is George.
113.862
# ANNA
113.862
 Anna.
115.294
116.534
I don't recall seeing you
around the office.
118.727
118.803
Do you work in the mailroom?
120.234
120.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
121.305
Not quite. I... I'm a friend
of Elaine Benes.
124.704
# ANNA
124.775
Oh, that's nice. Excuse me.
127.639
125.350
**LOL**
# GEORGE
127.712
So....
129.473
# MAN
130.915
How about leading us in a toast?
132.448
# ELAINE
132.516
Oh, sure.
133.844
133.918
Hey, guys, I wanna make a toast.
135.849
137.088
Here's to those who wish us well...
140.817
140.892
and those who don't
can go to hell.
144.484
145.450
**LOL**
147.999
All right. Who's dancing?
150.124
150.201
Come on, who's dancing?
151.529
151.602
You want...? You want me to get it
started? I'll get it started. All right.
155.729
169.754
Come on, guys.
What's the holdup?
172.254
# GEORGE
174.792
Sweet, fancy Moses.
178.259
# KRAMER
184.702
Hey. You get the tickets?
187.100
# JERRY
187.171
 Who needs two?
189.468
189.468
 Oh, mamacita! Let me see them.
191.765
190.300
**LOL**
191.842
Special sneak preview
of Death Blow.
193.569
# KRAMER
193.644
Death Blow. When someone
tries to blow you up...
197.339
197.415
not because of who you are...
199.005
199.083
but because
of different reasons altogether.
201.777
202.050
**LOL**
203.654
Yeah? Come on up.
205.415
205.489
Hey, Jerry, you think you could get
an extra ticket for my friend Brody?
208.956
# JERRY
209.026
Know what I had to go
through to get these?
211.060
# KRAMER
211.128
But he's a big fan of the genre.
213.059
213.130
You know, I'd consider it
a personal favor to me.
216.131
216.050
**LOL**
# JERRY
217.468
Yeah, I guess I do owe you. Yeah.
220.628
# KRAMER
221.505
Listen, you want me to stay here
till George gets up?
223.937
# JERRY
224.008
 No, I'm okay.
225.406
# KRAMER
225.406
 There's no problem, really.
226.804
# JERRY
226.877
I'm fine.
228.342
228.450
**LOL**
229.313
 He's right in there, boy.
230.512
230.512
 Yeah, okay.
231.711
231.782
Hey, how was the party?
234.373
# GEORGE
234.618
The food was good.
235.946
# JERRY
236.020
Yeah, so, I didn't miss anything?
237.644
# GEORGE
237.722
Well, actually, you did miss
one little nugget of entertainment.
241.986
241.450
**LOL**
242.827
Have you ever seen Elaine dance?
244.952
247.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
247.865
Elaine danced?
249.830
# GEORGE
251.769
It was more like a full-body
dry heave set to music.
255.930
255.350
**LOL**
# JERRY
257.308
Did she do the little kicks
and the thumbs?
260.002
260.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
260.444
 Wait, you mean you know about this?
261.791
# JERRY
261.791
 For some time.
263.138
263.481
It was about five years ago.
265.947
267.450
**LOL**
273.350
**LOL**
277.561
I never knew what to say to her
about it.
279.856
280.097
It was one of those problems
I hoped would just go away.
282.893
# GEORGE
282.967
Well, sometimes you can't help
these people till they hit rock bottom.
286.230
286.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
286.303
And by then you've lost interest.
287.893
# GEORGE
289.006
Take a ride with me later.
I borrowed my father's car, '68 GTO.
293.805
# JERRY
293.878
What made him get that thing?
295.309
# GEORGE
295.379
Well, during that period when my folks
were separated, he went a little crazy.
298.971
# JERRY
299.216
Not a very long trip.
301.341
300.700
**LOL**
# KRAMER
302.153
 Brody's in.
303.551
# JERRY
303.551
 I don't even have the extra ticket yet.
304.949
# KRAMER
305.022
Well, you better get on the horn.
307.613
306.950
**LOL**
# ELAINE
309.360
I'm telling you, Jerry,
I'm getting a vibe.
311.519
311.595
If I didn't know better, I'd say the staff
completely lost respect for me.
316.098
# JERRY
316.167
How could that be?
317.859
318.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
317.935
Well, Jerry, I mean,
it's like the feeling is palpable.
322.734
322.807
Could it have something
to do with the party?
324.898
# JERRY
324.975
No, George was there.
He said he had a great time.
327.566
# ELAINE
327.645
It's George. I bet you this is
somehow George-related.
331.010
# JERRY
331.082
 Oh, what are you talking about?
332.662
# ELAINE
332.662
 He's like a virus.
334.242
334.318
He attaches himself
to a healthy host company...
337.683
337.755
and the next thing you know,
the entire staff is infected.
341.518
341.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
341.592
Now you're talking crazy.
343.023
# ELAINE
343.094
All right. Then, Jerry, if that's not
what it is, you tell me. What is it?
346.527
# JERRY
350.734
There's my call waiting,
I gotta get going. Bye-bye.
354.133
352.100
**LOL**
352.900
**LOL**
# ANNA
356.440
Have a minute
to approve some copy?
358.201
# ELAINE
358.275
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure.
360.707
362.113
So did you have a good time
at the party last night?
365.239
# ANNA
365.316
It was a real kick.
368.146
368.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
369.220
Hey, did you happen to speak
to my friend George?
372.221
# ANNA
372.723
As a matter of fact, I did.
374.051
# ELAINE
375.126
Well, listen, you would be wise
to keep your distance from him.
378.957
# ANNA
379.029
Why? He seems harmless.
380.892
# ELAINE
380.965
Oh, he's not. He's very harmful.
383.659
# ANNA
384.468
 Really?
385.252
# ELAINE
385.252
 Oh, trust me.
386.035
386.103
He's a bad seed,
he's a horrible seed.
387.864
387.938
He's one of the worst seeds
I've ever seen.
390.006
390.050
**LOL**
# ANNA
390.141
And you two are friends?
391.833
# ELAINE
391.909
Yeah, we're good friends.
393.738
393.250
**LOL**
# GEORGE
396.046
So this Anna called me
from out of the blue.
399.081
# JERRY
399.150
 Really? I thought you were rebuffed.
401.117
# GEORGE
401.117
 With extreme prejudice.
403.084
402.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
403.154
 Maybe Elaine put in a good word.
404.688
# GEORGE
404.688
 No, no. See, that's the thing.
406.223
406.290
Anna told me Elaine said I was one
of the worst seeds she'd ever seen.
410.121
# JERRY
410.194
Interesting.
She doesn't care for you.
413.092
413.164
Then a stern warning.
414.697
414.765
Suddenly a phone call.
416.264
417.350
**LOL**
417.868
Seems Elaine's made you
the bad boy.
420.129
420.204
And Anna digs the bad boy.
423.273
# GEORGE
424.542
I'm the bad boy.
426.542
428.179
I've never been the bad boy.
430.474
# JERRY
430.548
You've been the bad employee,
the bad son, the bad friend.
433.344
# GEORGE
433.417
Yes. Yes, yes.
435.314
# JERRY
435.386
The bad fiancé, bad dinner guest,
bad credit risk.
437.818
# GEORGE
437.888
Okay, the point is made.
439.216
# JERRY
439.290
The bad date, the bad sport,
the bad citizen.
442.791
442.000
**LOL**
443.627
The bad tipper.
445.627
# JERRY
448.699
Half of show business is here.
450.460
# KRAMER
450.534
Oh, there's Brody. Brody, over here.
454.001
# BRODY
454.872
 Hey, Kramer.
455.667
455.667
 Yeah.
456.462
456.540
And you must be Jerry.
Thanks for the ticket.
459.837
# JERRY
459.910
That's quite a feedbag
you're working on there.
462.740
463.450
**LOL**
# BRODY
463.948
It's for all of us. Is there a problem?
466.744
# KRAMER
466.817
Brody. Brody, come on,
he's just kidding.
469.681
469.753
He's a joke maker. Tell him, Jerry.
472.651
# JERRY
472.723
I'm a joke maker.
474.484
474.450
**LOL**
# KRAMER
475.960
All right, here we go.
478.290
478.362
Death Blow.
480.521
# JERRY
490.207
Hey.
491.706
492.276
What the hell is he doing?
493.673
# KRAMER
493.744
Relax, he does that all the time.
496.335
496.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
498.549
Does what?
499.980
# KRAMER
500.050
He's making a copy of the movie
for sale on the street.
503.711
# JERRY
505.723
May I see you outside
for a moment, please?
507.848
# KRAMER
507.925
 No, I want to watch the movie.
509.124

 Outside!

 Hey, have you seen Anna?
513.812
# WORKER
513.812
 Just left to meet your friend George.
515.529
# ELAINE
515.599
To meet George?
516.859
516.967
I knew it. Where did they go?
518.364
# WORKER
518.435
 The park, why?
519.298
# ELAINE
519.298
 Don't you see?
520.162
520.237
George is in the bloodstream.
521.861
522.100
**LOL**
521.939
You stay away from him too.
523.404
# JERRY
525.509
What do you mean,
bootlegging the movie?
527.270
# KRAMER
527.344
It's a perfectly legitimate business.
529.378
# JERRY
529.446
 It's not legitimate.
530.662
# KRAMER
530.662
 It's a business.
531.878
532.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
531.949
 Where did you meet this guy?
533.096
# KRAMER
533.096
 Friend of a friend.
534.244
534.318
You know Corky Ramirez
up on 94th Street?
536.352
536.420
One day he and l
are playing pachinko...
538.385

No one's putting a gun

No.
567.174
569.219
A little.
570.843
572.022
Nice car.
573.350
# GEORGE
573.657
Yeah.
575.122
575.426
She's a sweet ride.
576.754
# ANNA
577.394
Is that your orthopedic back pillow?
579.257
# GEORGE
580.464
Maybe.
581.929
# ANNA
582.333
Well, is it, or isn't it?

585.836
I guess not.

 Stay away from her.
592.455
# GEORGE
592.455
 Hey, I didn't do nothing.
593.534
# ELAINE
593.610
 Get in the car.
594.274

 But...

You heard me, young lady.
Get in the car.
598.104
598.300
**LOL**
598.182
And you! You should know better.
600.580
600.651

So, Death Blow, we meet again.
626.206
626.310
Are you okay?
627.638
# BRODY
628.145
I got a cramp.
629.803
# KRAMER
629.980
Well, it's no wonder.
You ate that entire bag of candy.
633.846
# BRODY
634.885
There it goes again.
637.317
638.422
Kramer, you gotta drive me home.
640.251
# JERRY
640.324
What is going on over here?
641.652
# BRODY
641.725
Jerry, finish shooting
the movie for me.
644.055
# JERRY
644.128
Are you nuts? No way
I'm holding that thing.
646.492
# KRAMER
646.563
Jerry, the man is in pain.
648.654
# JERRY
648.732
If he didn't lick his fingers
before reaching in the bag...
651.562
651.635

Okay. Let's everybody just relax.

663.261
# JERRY
663.261
 All right, I'm taking the camera.
664.710
# KRAMER
664.782
All right, come on, let's go.
Thanks, buddy.
667.407

Oh, man.

**LOL**
# KRAMER
678.796
Hey.
680.386
681.231
So how was the rest
of Death Blow?
682.855
# JERRY
682.933
How was the rest of Death Blow?
684.591
# KRAMER
684.668
Who got the final deathblow?
686.065
686.136
I thought that Hawaiian guy
had it coming to him, huh?
688.727
688.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
688.806
You make me get a ticket
for this friend...
690.965
691.041
and then the guy forces me
to bootleg a movie at gunpoint?
694.110
# KRAMER
694.178
He's quite a character, isn't he?
696.405
# JERRY
696.480
He came by here last night at 3:00
in the morning to pick up the tape.
699.777
699.850
I was scared out of my mind.
701.383
702.200
**LOL**
# KRAMER
702.719
I'll get it.
704.309
704.655
 Yup.
705.319
# BRODY
705.319
 It's Brody.
705.983
# KRAMER
706.056
Yeah, come on up.
It's Brody, he's coming.
708.920
# JERRY
708.992
What? Are you crazy?
I don't want to see this guy again.
711.560
709.650
**LOL**
# KRAMER
711.628
Jerry, you did him a favor.
713.059
713.130
He probably wants to thank you.
714.891
# JERRY
714.965
What if I didn't do it right?
716.794
# KRAMER
716.867
It's your first time. He'll understand.
718.935
# JERRY
719.002
People with guns don't understand.
721.696
721.772
That's why they get guns.
Too many misunderstandings.
724.841
724.450
**LOL**
# KRAMER
725.442
 Hey, Brody.
726.692

# BRODY
728.011
Jerry, I have to talk to you
about the tape.
730.170
# JERRY
730.247
 Yeah.
731.793
# BRODY
731.793
 I've never seen such beautiful work.
733.339
# JERRY
733.417
 What?
734.463
# BRODY
734.463
 You're a genius.
735.508
735.586
The zoom-ins, the framing,
I was enchanted.
739.247
739.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
741.258
Well...
742.723
742.793
I did the best I could.
744.326
744.400
**LOL**
# BRODY
746.230
I got another project for you.
Here, go ahead.
748.924
748.999
It's a movie called Cry, Cry Again.
750.657
750.734
I was gonna give it to one of my
other guys, but it's an arty movie...
754.133
754.204
and quite frankly,
they don't have the sensibility.
757.273
757.950
**LOL**
# BRODY
760.544
 May I use your phone?
762.391
# KRAMER

# KRAMER

Look at you.
You got another gig, huh?
768.778
# JERRY
768.852
I don't want another gig.
770.886
770.954
I'm not doing this.
772.385
# KRAMER
772.456
But you have a gift. Look, Jerry,
this is not your little comedy act.
775.855
775.926
We're talking feature films here.
777.994
# JERRY
778.061
We're talking federal crime here.
780.220

**LOL**
# BRODY
783.033
I'll expect that tape
by 3:00 tomorrow.
786.534

 May I borrow this, please?
788.100
# KRAMER
788.100

817.262
# ELAINE
817.334
Oh, really? Because it looks
a little big for you.
820.995
821.071
It looks like something
a short, stocky...
824.334
824.408
slow-witted, bald man...
827.636
826.800

What were you thinking
when you shot this?
861.310
# KRAMER
861.378
 What? That's fine.
862.845
# JERRY
862.845
 You know what this scene is about?
864.311
# KRAMER
864.381
Yeah, it's about a guy
buying a loaf of bread.
866.881
# JERRY
866.950
No. Bread is his soul.
869.678
869.753
He's trying to buy back
a loaf of his soul.
873.653
# KRAMER
873.724
Wha... Where?
875.917
874.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
876.793
No way you're giving this tape
to Brody and telling him I shot it.
879.919
# KRAMER
879.997
 He's not gonna know the difference.
881.827
# JERRY
881.827
 I don't care about Brody.
883.658
883.734
I was up on 96th Street today.
885.324
885.402
There was a little kid, couldn't
have been more than 10 years old.
888.471
888.538
He was asking a street vendor
if he had any other bootlegs...
891.436
891.508
that looked as good
as Death Blow.
894.168
894.344
That's who I care about.
896.139
896.350
**LOL**
896.213
The little kid who needs bootlegs...
898.508
898.582
because his parent
or guardian won't let him see...
901.082
901.151
the excessive violence
and strong sexual content...
903.913
903.987
you and I take for granted.
905.850
# KRAMER
906.523
So you'll do the movie?
907.920
# JERRY
907.991
Oh. Oh, man. I sat in gum.
911.424
911.900
**LOL**
911.795
I have to.
913.795
913.930
But I'm gonna need
to storyboard this whole thing.
916.498
916.600
 Where are my Magic Markers?
917.964
# KRAMER

 Right here.

Well, I have lost
complete control of my staff.
923.872
923.940
Why did I let George go
to that party?
926.031
926.443
I mean, we were
having so much fun.
928.306
928.378
I mean, we were wining,
we were dining, we were dancing.
932.380

And that's not helping either.

That's why you're having trouble with
your staff, not because of George.

talking about?

Well, George, I just want you
to hear me say to Anna...

that you're a good

# GEORGE
1047.697
Pick up the phone, Elaine.
Pick it up.
1049.458

But here's what I need.
I'm gonna need three cameras...

1093.543
two on the floor, one in the balcony,
and I want headsets...

Yeah, look, Brody,
Jerry wants to do the bootleg.
1109.113
1109.192
He's dying to do it, but if you don't
make him happy, the work suffers...
1112.784

and then nobody's happy.
1115.056

1243.019
1243.093
 Great.
1243.792
1243.792
 Great, yeah.

Although the whole story
kind of comes apart at the end there.
1247.687
# JERRY
1247.764
Out of nowhere there's this lone
dancer who appears to be injured.
1250.833
# KRAMER
1250.900
Yeah. It's a disturbing image.
1252.865
1251.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
1252.936
Yeah. So you cry,
and then when you see the dancing...
1256.870
1256.940
you cry again.
1258.371
1258.550
**LOL**
# ANNA
1264.781
It's all right, George.
You'll just pay a fine, and that'll be it.
1267.873
# GEORGE
1267.951
Why did the policeman
have to yell at me like that?
1271.316
1270.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1271.888
 Anna.
1273.053
# ANNA
1273.053
 Oh, thanks for coming to pick me up.
1274.218
1274.290
 I can explain everything.
1275.170
# ELAINE
1275.170
 All right.
1276.051
1276.126
We'll talk about it at the office.
1277.955
# FRANK
1278.028
 Okay, where's my boy?
1279.727
# GEORGE
1279.727
 Oh, my God.
1281.427
1281.350
**LOL**
# FRANK
1281.865
I'm sitting at home reading
a periodical, and this is the call I get?
1286.231
1286.302
My son is a bootlegger?
1288.495
1288.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1288.605
Ow, Dad!
1290.172
# FRANK
1290.640
 Who put you up to this? Was it her?
1291.907
# ELAINE
1291.907
 All right.
1293.174
1293.243
Wait, I think
you've got it backwards.
1295.243
# FRANK
1295.311
George isn't clever enough
to hatch a scheme like this.
1297.902
1298.350
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1297.981
 You got that right.
1299.812
# FRANK
1299.812
 What the hell does that mean?
1301.642
# ELAINE
1301.718
That means whatever the hell
you want it to mean.
1304.582
# FRANK
1304.654
You saying you want a piece of me?
1306.585
1307.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1308.058
I could drop you like a bag of dirt.
1311.685
1310.700
**LOL**
# FRANK
1312.462
You want a piece of me?
1314.462
1314.531
You got it!
1315.893
1315.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
1324.240
But he's an old man, Elaine.
1326.171
# ELAINE
1326.242
Well, he wrote the check,
and I cashed it.
1329.641
# JERRY
1329.712
Look, here's that bootlegged
Death Blow that I shot.
1332.246
1330.350
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1332.315
 Cry, Cry Again, I want to see that.
1333.878
# JERRY
1333.878
 No, you don't.
1335.441
# MAN
1335.518
 You shot Death Blow?
1336.518
# JERRY
1336.518
 Yeah.
1337.518
# MAN
1337.587
 It was brilliant.
1338.604
# JERRY
1338.604
 Thank you.
1339.621
# ELAINE
1339.689
 You were big.
1340.735
1340.750
**LOL**
# JERRY
1340.735
 I'm still big.
1341.780
1341.858
It's the bootlegs that got small.
1344.324
1344.394
 How are things at the office? Normal?
1345.758
# ELAINE
1345.758
 Yeah, pretty much.
1347.122
1347.197
Although I still get the vibe
every once in a while.
1349.629
