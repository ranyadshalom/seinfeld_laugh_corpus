What did you wanna see me

Kramer, I've been reviewing
your work.
1132.888
1132.922
Quite frankly, it stinks.

# KRAMER
1136.022

I've been having trouble
at home, and, uh...
1140.988
1141.022
I mean, uh, you know,
I'll work harder.

No. No, I don't think
that's going to do it, uh...
1148.988
1149.022
These reports you handed in,
1151.488
1151.522
it's almost as if you have
no business training at all.
