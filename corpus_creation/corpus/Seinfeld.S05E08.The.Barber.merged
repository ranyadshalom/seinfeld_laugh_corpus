The old-fashioned barbershop is,
unfortunately,
3.600
3.633
becoming a thing of the past.
5.266
5.300
Now, what went wrong?
6.266
6.300
Well, first of all,
7.266
7.300
he needs a $20,000 chair
9.633
9.666
to make a $3 tip.
11.966
11.800
**LOL**
12.962
I say cut back on the chair,
14.895
14.928
update the magazines.
17.428
17.462
Why do barbers
always display that license?
20.228
20.262
There's no laws in hair cutting.
21.928
21.962
But show customers
the back of their head.
23.695
23.728
That's the one law.
24.895
24.928
I don't want to see the back
of my head.
26.462
26.495
Why do I want to see something
27.695
27.728
that I won't see
at any other time?

When I buy pants,
30.000
30.562
two salesmen don't lift me up
by the legs and go:
32.628
32.662
"How do you like the crotch?"
35.128
35.162
If I wanted to see everything,
I would've been a fly.

Ah, well.
59.595
59.628
I feel like I don't
61.462
61.495
I don't have to explain
every little thing to you.
64.262

You understand
everything immediately.
66.062

He never finished
his sentence.
93.695
93.728
He got a call,
ended the interview.
95.428
# JERRY
95.462
"Of course,"
was the last thing?
96.928
# GEORGE
96.962
Maybe he was going to say,
98.262
98.295
"Of course, I have to check
with my associates."

# ELAINE
111.995
Why don't you just
go ahead and call him?
114.028
# GEORGE
114.062
Because he made a big deal
115.462
115.495
about how I understand
everything immediately.
117.595
117.628
That's what impressed him.
118.895
# JERRY
118.928
So if you call to ask
if you have the job,
120.895
120.928
you might lose the job.
122.095
# GEORGE
122.128
And if I don't call
123.128
123.200
**LOL**
# JERRY

You might have
the job,

"that our Board of Directors
