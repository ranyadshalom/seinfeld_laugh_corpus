Why are people surprised...
3.594
5.120
...when someone
gets hit with a golf ball?
7.395
7.560
Have you watched
the tournaments on TV?
9.312
9.480
You got 600 people
crowding around a hole that big...
12.358
11.200
**LOL**
12.520
...and no one believes it
when a Titleist...
14.397
14.560
...bounces off someone's coconut.
16.312
16.480
You know, you throw a rock into
a crowd, that's considered terrorism.
19.995
20.160
But if you have a nice follow-through,
you know, that's golf.
24.438
21.350
**LOL**
23.450
**LOL**
24.880
I'm always impressed
with the golf cameraman...
26.996
27.160
...whose job it is to follow the golf ball
when it's in the sky.
30.948
31.120
It's a little white ball doing 100 miles
an hour on a white background.
34.237
34.400
"l got it. I lost it. I got it. I lost it."
36.595
35.500
**LOL**
36.760
Why bother? Aim the camera
at the sky. Aim it at the ground.
39.320
39.480
Take a ball out of your pocket.
Throw it down.
41.391
41.560
Who's gonna know
where the hell it came from?

How did you lock your keys
in your car?
49.752

How? Because I'm an idiot.

# JERRY
52.960
Why didn't you get a locksmith?
53.978
# GEORGE
53.978
I was going to.
54.996
55.160
Then I found out the Auto Club has
free locksmith service, so I signed up.
58.709

Just waiting
for the membership to kick in.

I'll tell you something else.
88.312

Stan's advice has transformed
my game. He's never wrong.
92.075
92.240
He thinks eventually I'll have a shot
at making it big on the Senior Tour.
96.518

# STAN
121.640
Here's what you do.
You bring a lightweight jacket.
124.029
124.200
That way, the sun comes out,
you play the jacket off the sweater.

# KRAMER

I can't understand why they haven't
won a pennant in 15 years.
220.230

And it is all because of that car.

See, Steinbrenner is, like,

She stole my boyfriend
when I was in high school.

I was at this party, and I was
dating this really cute guy.

What happens if I can't play

# ELAINE
558.960
Yeah, she's loaded.
560.240
560.650
**LOL**
560.400
She's the heiress to the
Oh Henry! candy-bar fortune.
562.675
# KRAMER
562.840
I can't. I learned my lesson
from that coffee company.

# ELAINE
565.360
Kramer, listen to me.
566.998
567.160
Listen. This is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
569.594
569.760
Your dreams have been shattered.
571.113
571.280
Somebody's gotta be
held accountable.
573.271

Come on. We'll take her
for every penny she's got.

# KRAMER
# JACKIE
592.280
Then what happened?
593.156
# KRAMER
593.156
We saw this woman...
594.032
594.200
...and she was wearing a bra
with no top.
596.270
# JACKIE
596.440
No top? She didn't have a top on?
598.396
# KRAMER
598.560
Yeah, so I got distracted
and I crashed the car.
601.916
# JACKIE
602.080
How would you describe
this woman?

Would you say she was attractive?

So we got an attractive woman...
608.149
608.320
...wearing a bra, no top,
walking around in broad daylight.
611.198
610.150
**LOL**
611.360
She's flouting society's conventions.
612.952
# KRAMER
613.120
She was flouting.
614.314
# JACKIE
614.314
That's totally inappropriate.
615.509
615.680
It's lewd, lascivious, salacious,
outrageous.
619.195
# KRAMER
619.360
It was outrageous.
620.679
620.840
And she's the heir to

623.513
623.150
**LOL**
# JACKIE
624.120
Could you repeat that?
626.031
# KRAMER

629.112

631.320
That's one of our
top-selling candy bars.

633.520
It's got chocolate, peanuts, nougat.
635.909
636.080
It's delicious, scrumptious,
outstanding.

We trade Jim Leyritz

662.560
...for Barry Bonds.
What do you think?
664.391
664.560
Then I have Griffey and

716.355
716.520
...and there's blood in the car,
and we can't find him anywhere.
719.239
719.400
Obviously, he was in some sort of
a terrible car accident...
722.312

He had 30 home runs
and over 100 RBls last year.

Wait a second. Wait a second.
984.119
983.950

They saw the car and the blood, that's
why Steinbrenner thinks you're dead.

After the car accident,
I crawled into a ditch.

1065.600
**LOL**
1065.800
I managed to survive...

for us to get Bonds and Griffey...
1079.912
1080.080
...and we wouldn't
give up that much.
1081.672
1081.850
**LOL**
# STEINBRENNER

Don't tell it to me. Tell it to the
new assistant to the general manager.
1085.116
# GEORGE
1085.280
I didn't get the job?
1086.679
# STEINBRENNER
1086.840
You were dead. We couldn't sit on
our hands. We had to make a move.
1089.957
# STEINBRENNER
1090.160
But you still have your old job.
1091.878
1092.040
Of course we'll have to
dock the time you missed.
1094.156
1094.320
We're running a ball club.
1095.594
1095.760
If I give special treatment to you,
everyone will want it. Next, it's chaos.
1099.196
1099.360
And I can tell you this; Chaos does
not work for the New York Yankees.
1102.557
1102.720
Not as long
as I'm running the show!
1104.756
# JACKIE
1106.240
So it was the meeting on the street
that prompted you to buy the bra.
1109.198
1109.360
Would you say that was correct?
1110.719
# ELAINE
1110.719
Yes.
1112.079
1112.240
Yes. That's correct.
1113.912
# JACKIE
1117.160
And you have also brought with you
another bra...
1119.549
1119.350
**LOL**
1120.520
...exactly like the one that she
so flagrantly exhibited herself in?
1124.798
# ELAINE
1125.440
Yes, that's correct.
1126.873
# JACKIE
1127.040
What was your golf score
the last round you played...
1129.270
1129.250
**LOL**
1129.440
...before your shoulder was injured?
1130.720
# KRAMER
1130.720
Three under par.
1132.000
# JACKIE
1133.160
Three under par.
1135.037
1134.650
**LOL**
1136.320
That's what the professionals shoot,
isn't it?
1138.390
1139.050
**LOL**
# KRAMER
1138.560
Well, if they're lucky.
1140.198
# JACKIE
1144.040
Would you tell this jury...
1145.268
1145.440
...exactly what you saw at the corner
of 83rd Street and Columbus?
1148.750
1150.450
**LOL**
# JERRY
1152.160
I don't remember.
1154.230
# JACKIE
1156.640
Did you or did you not see
the defendant wearing the bra?
1159.279
1159.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
1159.600
I don't know. Maybe.
1160.999
# JACKIE
1161.160
Mr. Seinfeld, I might remind you
that you are under oath.
1163.594
1163.760
Now, I ask you again.
1165.193
1165.360
Did you or did you not
see this woman wearing a bra?
1168.158
# JERRY
1172.000
All right, I saw her. I saw her.
1174.389
# JERRY
1175.680
And she was beautiful in that bra.
I'm crazy about her.
1179.468
1179.640
I love her whole free-swinging,
freewheeling attitude.
1182.677
1182.400
**LOL**
# JUDGE
1182.840
This court will come to order.
1184.159
# JACKIE
1184.320
No further questions, Your Honour.
1185.958
# JUDGE
1185.958
You may step down.
1187.596
1187.600
**LOL**
# JACKIE
1187.760
Well, Kramer,
I think we got this wrapped up.
1189.751
# KRAMER
1189.920
Yeah, yeah.
1191.478
1191.640
What's your read, Stan?
1193.437
# STAN
1193.600
You're close. You're on the green.
1196.160
1196.320
You just have to go for the cup.
1199.039
# KRAMER
1199.200
What do you mean?
1200.394
# STAN
1200.394
Have her try on the bra.
1201.589
1201.760
See if it fits.
1202.914
1202.650
**LOL**
# JACKIE
1202.914
No, no, no, no.
1204.069
# KRAMER
1204.240
Do it, Jackie. Stan's the man.
1206.674
# JACKIE
1206.840
Stan? Who the hell is Stan?
1208.177
# KRAMER
1208.177
He's my caddy.
1209.513
# JACKIE
1209.680
Your caddy? This is a big mistake.
1212.353
# KRAMER
# JACKIE
1214.200
Your Honour...
1215.758
1214.950
**LOL**
1215.920
...we request at this time
that Miss Mischke try on the bra.
1220.038
1221.750
**LOL**
# JUDGE
1221.960
This court will come to order.
1224.155
1224.320
Go ahead, Miss Mischke, try it on.
1226.390
# SUEELLEN
1241.560
It doesn't fit. I can't put it on.
1244.836
# JACKIE
1245.440
You damn fools! Look at that.
We got nothing now. Nothing.
1249.035
1249.200
I've been practicing law for 25 years,
you're listening to a caddy.
1252.033
# KRAMER
# JACKIE
1252.200
This is a public humiliation.
1253.679
1253.840
You can't let the defendant
control the key piece of evidence.
1256.479
1256.640
Plus, she's trying it on over a leotard.
Of course it won't fit over a leotard.
1260.076
1260.240
A bra's gotta fit right up against
a person's skin. Like a glove!
1264.597
1272.500
**LOL**
1273.760
Hey, Elaine. How about some lunch?
1276.320
# ELAINE
1277.360
No, I don't think so.
1279.191
1279.360
Great job on the Gatsby Swing Top.
It's a winner.
1282.557
# ELAINE
1282.720
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.
1284.278
1284.440
Sure you don't wanna go?
We have reservations.
1286.510
# ELAINE
1286.680
Oh, I don't think you'll have
any trouble getting a table.
