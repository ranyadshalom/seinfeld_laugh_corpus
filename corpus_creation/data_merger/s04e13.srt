1
00:00:00,742 --> 00:00:02,491
So I went to a fashion show.

2
00:00:02,492 --> 00:00:05,862
First of all, the whole concept of
modeling is counterproductive...

3
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:07,232
to the fashion industry.

4
00:00:07,306 --> 00:00:10,170
Because when these women
are around, who's looking at clothes?

5
00:00:10,243 --> 00:00:13,141
I didn't notice any of the clothes.
We're all applauding. Yeah.

6
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:15,872
What are we applauding?
"There's great-looking women here.

7
00:00:15,948 --> 00:00:17,174
This is great.

8
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,978
I'm glad I'm here with all
these great-looking women."

9
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:21,381
Anybody can design a shirt.

10
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:25,991
It takes talent to get all these girls
in one spot. That's talent.

11
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,753
What is this goofy walk
that the models do?

12
00:00:28,828 --> 00:00:31,396
You know this walk
that they do down the runway?

13
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,929
Like they have to go somewhere.

14
00:00:32,999 --> 00:00:36,626
They're walking like they're really
on the way somewhere.

15
00:00:36,702 --> 00:00:39,566
Then they get to the end,
and it's like:

16
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,172
"Well, I guess I'll just go back."

17
00:00:47,747 --> 00:00:49,940
I loved her, Jerry. I loved her.

18
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,344
No, you didn't.

19
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:56,248
- And she loved me. She really did.
- No, she didn't.

20
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,587
What am I gonna do now?
I can't live without Susan.

21
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:06,459
I gotta get her back. How?
How am I gonna to get her back?

22
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:09,362
Not only didn't you love her,
you didn't even like her!

23
00:01:11,003 --> 00:01:14,129
- Who says?
- You did!

24
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,771
A beautiful, successful, intelligent
woman's in love with me.

25
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:22,506
And I throw it all away.
Oh, boy.

26
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,276
Now I'll spend the rest
of my life living alone.

27
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:28,113
I'll sit in my disgusting
little apartment...

28
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:31,279
watching basketball games,
eating Chinese takeout...

29
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:35,393
walking around with no underwear
because I'm too lazy to do the laundry.

30
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,727
You walk around
with no underwear?

31
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:42,100
What do you do when
you run out of laundry?

32
00:01:42,168 --> 00:01:44,429
I do a wash.

33
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,097
Who am I gonna meet
that's better than her?

34
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:51,209
No one, Jerry.
No one's better than her.

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,845
When you were with her,
you said you couldn't stand her.

36
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:55,913
I loved her.

37
00:01:55,982 --> 00:01:58,141
You said going up the steps
to her apartment...

38
00:01:58,217 --> 00:01:59,944
was like being taken to a cell.

39
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:03,520
I would give anything to be going
up those stairs again.

40
00:02:03,589 --> 00:02:05,452
I gotta call her. Should I call her?

41
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,422
I don't know if that's
such a good idea.

42
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:09,959
- Why?
- You need some professional advice.

43
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,597
Why don't you go see
Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.

44
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,325
I'm not gonna see that nut doctor
she went to Europe with.

45
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,470
No, no. Elaine, what's the name
of that friend of yours...

46
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,503
that's a therapist? The woman.

47
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,436
- Dana Foley.
- Right. Dana Foley.

48
00:02:22,508 --> 00:02:24,508
- She any good?
- Yeah, she's terrific.

49
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,770
Why? You thinking of going?

50
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,438
Tia? Who's that?

51
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,511
It's that model I met on the plane.

52
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,786
She sent you a Christmas card?

53
00:02:38,824 --> 00:02:41,449
And we're going out Saturday night.

54
00:02:41,527 --> 00:02:45,961
My darling, Susan. My darling!

55
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,396
- What are you doing?
- Date with Fred.

56
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:51,627
- The religious guy?
- He's not that religious.

57
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,536
Let us pray.

58
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,568
- You got any Double Crunch?
- Yeah.

59
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,371
Kramer, should I call Susan?

60
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,912
Now, what does the little man
inside you say?

61
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:05,812
See, you gotta listen
to the little man.

62
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,220
- My little man doesn't know.
- The little man knows all.

63
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:12,823
My little man's an idiot.

64
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,855
See, she was clever.

65
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:19,191
She put her picture on her card.
I never do anything like that.

66
00:03:19,265 --> 00:03:21,492
You want a picture on a card.
I can do that.

67
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:25,398
She kept such a nice, clean
apartment. She was so sanitary.

68
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,369
No. I was thinking out loud.
I don't want my picture on a card.

69
00:03:28,441 --> 00:03:30,668
I'll take it.
I'll take care of everything.

70
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,902
She made a big breakfast
every Sunday.

71
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:35,070
I don't know what
she put in those eggs.

72
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,980
You come on over. I'll have my
cereal, and I'll take your picture.

73
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:40,743
Really? Can you take a picture?

74
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,218
He takes good pictures.
He's got equipment there.

75
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:44,822
- All right.
- Yeah.

76
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,857
- I don't know about that outfit, though.
- What's wrong with it?

77
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,995
Well, we'll have to improvise.

78
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,592
Oh, hey

79
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:58,732
If you happen to see

80
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,669
The most beautiful girl

81
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:06,073
Who walked out on me

82
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:10,573
Tell her I'm sorry

83
00:04:11,717 --> 00:04:15,947
Tell her I need my baby

84
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:19,387
Won't you tell her

85
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:23,053
That I love her?

86
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,329
- Oh, hey...
- George.

87
00:04:28,034 --> 00:04:31,103
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave.

88
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:36,741
So I'm thinking of putting in
a tropical-fish tank right here.

89
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,639
Are sure you're ready
for that kind of commitment?

90
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,940
Well, if it doesn't work out,
I can flush them down the toilet.

91
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:44,514
That's horrible.

92
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,207
What's the perfume you're wearing?

93
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:48,785
Oh, I completely forgot.
I want you to see this.

94
00:04:48,854 --> 00:04:52,014
That Calvin Klein ad I was telling
you about came out today.

95
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,022
- What is that smell?
- It's here somewhere.

96
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:57,458
- It smells like the beach.
- Exactly.

97
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,622
- Oh, my God. Is that the new perfume?
- Yeah.

98
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,998
I can't believe this. My neighbor had
the idea for this perfume last year.

99
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:08,538
He met with a Calvin Klein executive.
I can't believe they stole his idea.

100
00:05:08,607 --> 00:05:12,438
- Are you sure?
- And you're the model for this perfume?

101
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,907
That's him. He just came home.

102
00:05:16,982 --> 00:05:18,913
I'll lock the door.

103
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,943
Hey.

104
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,285
Hey.

105
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:26,291
Hey, how you doing?

106
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,028
Yeah, I'll see you later.

107
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,325
I just wanted to borrow
your DustBuster.

108
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,898
All right, come on in.

109
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,871
- Just wait over here.
- What?

110
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,871
Just wait here,
and I'll get it for you.

111
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:45,809
- Kramer, this is Tia.
- Hello.

112
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,752
- How tall are you?
- 5'10".

113
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,388
Let's see. Come on. Back to back.

114
00:05:58,057 --> 00:05:59,954
- No, Kramer!
- What?

115
00:06:00,025 --> 00:06:02,423
What's the matter? I wanted
to see how tall she was.

116
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:06,190
You're tall. She's tall. I'm tall.
What's the difference? We're all tall.

117
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:07,855
- What's that?
- What?

118
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:10,729
- That smell. What's that smell?
- What smell?

119
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:14,371
It's very familiar. I can't put
my finger on it. It's familiar.

120
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,065
Oh, they're all the same.
Here. Now, if you'll excuse us.

121
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,938
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

122
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,908
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice meeting you too.

123
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,608
Yeah, I'll see you later.

124
00:06:26,185 --> 00:06:27,946
That was close.

125
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,917
The beach!

126
00:06:30,756 --> 00:06:33,586
You smell like the beach.
What's that perfume you're wearing?

127
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:36,250
- It's Ocean by Calvin Klein.
- Calvin Klein?

128
00:06:36,328 --> 00:06:39,261
No. No, that's my idea.
They stole my idea.

129
00:06:39,331 --> 00:06:42,229
I had the idea of a cologne that
made you smell like the beach.

130
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,232
I know. Look at this.

131
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,539
That's you. What is going on here?

132
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:52,336
The jerk! He laughs at me.
Then he steals my idea!

133
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:53,842
I could've been a millionaire.

134
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,073
I could have been
a fragrance millionaire, Jerry.

135
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,646
They're not gonna
get away with this.

136
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:08,789
Hello, George. Come in, come in.
I've heard an awful lot about you.

137
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,657
- Please sit down.
- Well, hello.

138
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,524
Specifically, the reason
that I'm here...

139
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,692
I don't know what
Elaine told you, but...

140
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,771
I broke up with my girlfriend
a couple of weeks ago.

141
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,636
Actually, she broke up
with me, and...

142
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,300
Well, I was the cause of it, and...

143
00:07:26,378 --> 00:07:29,379
I just wanted to find out from you...

144
00:07:29,448 --> 00:07:30,913
What's with this thing?

145
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:34,348
- So she broke up with you.
- Yeah, and...

146
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:37,255
Why won't this go down?

147
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:39,391
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

148
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:40,923
So why'd she break up with you?

149
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:43,653
What is with this damn zipper?

150
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,764
It doesn't matter. Fix it later.
Tell me about your girlfriend.

151
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,234
It's stuck on a piece of cloth here.

152
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:51,630
I can't get the cloth out.

153
00:07:51,704 --> 00:07:53,738
- It doesn't matter...
- This is a new jacket.

154
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,898
Boy, this really burns me up.

155
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:00,939
George. George, look at me.

156
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:03,013
Okay, forget about the zipper.

157
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,774
What's your girlfriend's name?

158
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,519
- Susan.
- Okay, we're getting somewhere.

159
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:17,758
It's just so frustrating. It's a
brand-new jacket for crying out loud.

160
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:28,634
So Fred and I are gonna do volunteer
work for that church on Amsterdam.

161
00:08:28,707 --> 00:08:32,174
Volunteer work. See, that's what I love
about the holiday season.

162
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,107
That's the true spirit
of Christmas.

163
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,806
People being helped
by people other than me.

164
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,149
That makes me feel good inside.

165
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:45,722
Oh, look at what we have here.

166
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:48,655
A Christmas card from Lainey.

167
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:52,658
Thank you. You didn't have to
go to that trouble.

168
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:55,231
It was no trouble.
My assistant did the whole thing.

169
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,336
- How'd the picture come out?
- Oh, you know. It's a picture.

170
00:08:58,404 --> 00:09:01,166
Oh, look at that. Looks good.
Kramer did a good job.

171
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,399
Yeah, well, how hard is it
to take a picture?

172
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,678
- What?
- Did you look at this picture carefully?

173
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,175
Carefully?

174
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:15,412
Because I'm not sure,
and correct me if I'm wrong...

175
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:18,454
but I think I see a nipple.

176
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,328
- What?
- Here, take a look. What is that?

177
00:09:25,397 --> 00:09:27,556
Oh, my God!

178
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,559
That's my nipple!

179
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:34,728
- That's what I thought.
- That's my nipple! My nipple's exposed!

180
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:38,401
I sent this card
to hundreds of people.

181
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:43,871
My parents. My boss.
Nana and Papa.

182
00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:46,711
- Didn't you look at the picture?
- Oh, God, I didn't notice.

183
00:09:46,785 --> 00:09:50,343
What am I gonna do? You know,
your whole life, you go through...

184
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:53,685
painstaking efforts to hide
your nipple, and then boom.

185
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,885
Suddenly hundreds of people
get their own personal shot of it.

186
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,459
Hey.

187
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,132
- Have you seen the card?
- What card?

188
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,396
- My Christmas card.
- Yeah. Of course, I took it.

189
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,472
Did you notice
anything unusual about it?

190
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,234
- No.
- Well, come here and take a look.

191
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,344
- Yeah, so?
- So, what's that?

192
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,845
- That's a nipple.
- Right.

193
00:10:21,253 --> 00:10:25,653
- Oh, great. Didn't you see that?
- No, I didn't notice it.

194
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,088
It's because you made me wear
that stupid shirt.

195
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,728
Well, maybe no one noticed it.
You didn't notice it.

196
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,263
- Let's see if Newman sees it.
- No, I don't want him looking.

197
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,594
What's the difference?
Everybody else has it.

198
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,134
Give me that.

199
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:41,704
Oh, my God, I sent one to the
super in my building, my mailman.

200
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:43,307
My 10-year-old little nephew.

201
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:48,879
Sister Mary Catherine, Father Chelios.
Oh, my God, Fred. I sent one to Fred.

202
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,039
- Okay, what is it?
- Here.

203
00:10:52,117 --> 00:10:55,277
Take a look at this card. Tell me
if you notice anything unusual.

204
00:10:55,354 --> 00:10:58,082
Yeah, your nipple's showing.

205
00:10:59,658 --> 00:11:01,157
Okay, thanks.

206
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:02,554
- Anything else?
- No.

207
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:04,753
All right. See you later.

208
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,200
What? So what?

209
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,332
It's a nipple.

210
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,902
It's a little brown,
circular protuberance.

211
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,140
What's the big deal?

212
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:21,211
Everybody's got them.
Look, I got them.

213
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,171
- I got them too.
- Look at this.

214
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:27,984
Everybody's got them.

215
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:32,081
See, it's kind of gotta little piece of
cloth that's stuck underneath and...

216
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:33,884
Well, can you pull it up a bit?

217
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,456
Well, here you hold it.
Wait, hold it. Hold it.

218
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,154
Damn it. I can't move it.

219
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:42,163
God, I've never seen
a zipper so stubborn.

220
00:11:42,801 --> 00:11:44,163
Damn it. I almost had it.

221
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:46,201
Okay. Wait, that'll separate it.

222
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:47,998
- Let me try.
- Take it off the track.

223
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:50,505
You're gonna rip it.
You're gonna rip it.

224
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:56,912
I'm afraid we're
gonna have to stop now.

225
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,074
Okay.

226
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,381
My mother is gonna pay
for the session.

227
00:12:05,758 --> 00:12:07,849
Oh, is this Elaine?

228
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:09,391
Yeah.

229
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,703
No!

230
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,916
No!

231
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,915
No. Oh, no.

232
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,124
I've called every day for four days.
She hasn't returned one call.

233
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,255
Was it a scratch...

234
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,765
or a pick?

235
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,302
It was a scratch.

236
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:55,099
Hey, it's me.

237
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,805
Don't you think I know the difference
between a pick and a scratch?

238
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,015
- Yeah.
- It's me.

239
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:06,480
Come on up.

240
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:10,645
Was there any
nostril penetration?

241
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,655
There may have been some
incidental penetration...

242
00:13:14,726 --> 00:13:18,318
but from her angle, she was
in no position to make the call.

243
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:22,793
So let's say, in her mind,
she witnessed a pick.

244
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:25,801
- Okay, so then what?
- Is that so unforgivable?

245
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:27,598
Is that like breaking
a commandment?

246
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:30,469
Did God say to Moses,
"Thou shalt not pick"?

247
00:13:30,542 --> 00:13:33,668
I guarantee you
Moses was a picker.

248
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:38,649
You wander through the desert
for 40 years with that dry air.

249
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,921
You telling me you're not gonna have
occasion to clean house a little?

250
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,685
Let me ask you something.
If you were dating somebody...

251
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:53,456
and she did that, would you
continue going out with her?

252
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,100
No. That's disgusting.

253
00:13:58,203 --> 00:14:01,238
You cannot believe
what I am going through.

254
00:14:01,306 --> 00:14:04,000
That card is plastered
all over the office.

255
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,406
Everybody's calling me "Nip."

256
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,843
Yeah, that's my new nickname
at the office. Nip.

257
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,178
These guys keep asking
me out for drinks.

258
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:16,913
Not only that. Fred, you know,
the guy I told you about...

259
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,989
he hasn't called me in three days.

260
00:14:19,057 --> 00:14:21,853
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

261
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:24,325
How come I didn't get
a Christmas card?

262
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:26,589
Everybody else got one.

263
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,892
Jerry got one. Kramer got one.

264
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,525
I thought we were good friends. I don't
get a Christmas card. I don't get it.

265
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:35,798
You want a Christmas card? You want
a Christmas card? All right, here.

266
00:14:35,874 --> 00:14:37,703
Here's your Christmas card.

267
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:50,989
You got any Double Crunch?

268
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:53,215
Yeah, I think I do.

269
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:01,091
- What's that perfume?
- It's the ocean.

270
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,393
That's mine. That's my smell.

271
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:06,696
Jerry, get that model to get me an
appointment with Calvin Klein.

272
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,533
I can't. She won't return my calls...

273
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:10,868
because she caught me
in a pick at a light.

274
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,069
- I thought you said it was a scratch.
- That's not what she thinks.

275
00:15:15,147 --> 00:15:18,580
Call her agency. Maybe she's been
out of town and didn't get the calls.

276
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,149
Get it.

277
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,346
All right.

278
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:25,249
I'll call the agency.

279
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:31,722
Hello.

280
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,888
I'm trying to get in touch
with Tia Van Kamp.

281
00:15:33,966 --> 00:15:36,125
Do you know if she's been in town?

282
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:38,030
Oh, really?

283
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,137
- Well, thank you very much.
- What?

284
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,172
She has been in town.
She's at Calvin Klein right now.

285
00:15:43,241 --> 00:15:45,536
Let's go.

286
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,706
It'll be different this time.
I promise.

287
00:15:51,783 --> 00:15:54,283
I promise difference.
I'm committed to difference.

288
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:57,445
I need someone a little more stable.

289
00:15:57,522 --> 00:16:00,420
I'm not stable? I'm like a rock.

290
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:04,619
I take these glasses off, you can't tell
the difference between me and a rock.

291
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:08,129
I put these glasses on a rock, you
know what jumps into people's minds?

292
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,268
Costanza.

293
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,165
- People don't change.
- I change. I change.

294
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,568
Two weeks ago,
I tried a soft-boiled egg.

295
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,643
Never liked it before. Now, I'm dunking
a piece of toast in there and loving it.

296
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,775
I'm not a soft-boiled egg.

297
00:16:24,282 --> 00:16:27,146
And I am not a piece of toast.

298
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,844
I just don't think that we have
anything in common.

299
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:32,114
That's okay. That's good.

300
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,350
You think Louis Pasteur and
his wife had anything in common?

301
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:39,395
He was in the fields all day
with the cows and the milk...

302
00:16:39,464 --> 00:16:43,364
examining the milk, delving into milk,
consumed with milk.

303
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:45,730
Pasteurization. Homogenization.

304
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:49,704
And she was in the kitchen, killing
cockroaches with a boot on each hand.

305
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,839
Why were there
so many cockroaches?

306
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:56,105
Because there was a lot of cake
lying around the house...

307
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:00,741
just sitting there with all the excess
milk from the all experiments.

308
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:05,980
- And they got along?
- Yes. Yes.

309
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,253
She didn't know
about pasteurization.

310
00:17:08,326 --> 00:17:12,385
He didn't know about fumigation.
But they made it work.

311
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:16,860
- You can't go in.
- I want to talk to Calvin.

312
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,332
- Let me talk to Calvin.
- Wait.

313
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:20,562
- I just want to talk to Calvin.
- Kramer?

314
00:17:20,672 --> 00:17:22,364
- Oh, Tia, hi.
- Who are you?

315
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,031
I'm here to talk about the ocean.

316
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,770
Oh, yes, Kramer.

317
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:30,676
I think I know something about this.
Would you excuse us, Tia?

318
00:17:31,149 --> 00:17:33,513
- I don't want any trouble, Calvin.
- Neither do I.

319
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:36,916
Hello. There you are.

320
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:38,612
Hello. What are you doing here?

321
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,281
I had to talk to you.
You haven't returned my calls.

322
00:17:41,526 --> 00:17:43,560
Well, I've been busy.

323
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:47,186
I thought we had a good time. The only
explanation I could come up with is...

324
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:50,095
you think that you caught me...

325
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:52,634
I'd rather not talk about this.

326
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:55,568
But I was clearly
on the outer edge of the nostril.

327
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,970
- I know what I saw.
- But there was no pick.

328
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,974
I did not pick. There was no pick.

329
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:03,774
- I gotta go.
- No. No pick.

330
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,314
Now here's the scoop, Calvin.

331
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:09,943
I came in here last January
to talk to one of your flunkies.

332
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,486
Interesting face.

333
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,920
And when I told him my idea
about the beach cologne...

334
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,584
you know, he laughed at me.

335
00:18:17,662 --> 00:18:20,993
You're very lithe, aren't you?
Very graceful.

336
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:23,391
Well, yeah.

337
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,933
- Sit down.
- All right.

338
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,570
You're very lean. But muscular.

339
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:38,739
You know, I try to take care of myself.
I watch what I eat.

340
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,681
Just recently, I cut out fructose.

341
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,913
I think you're spectacular.

342
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:53,386
I told you, Fred. My friend's
next-door neighbor took it.

343
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,930
So, what happened?

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,627
Well, I... I must have missed a button.
I forgot to button it.

345
00:18:58,703 --> 00:19:02,330
I really don't see how you could
miss a button like that.

346
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:03,997
Oh, you've never missed a button?

347
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:08,136
- Yeah.
- It's your sister, Gail.

348
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,146
Oh, God. My nephew.

349
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:13,178
Hi, Gail.

350
00:19:13,251 --> 00:19:14,579
Yeah.

351
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,880
Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.

352
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,455
Hey, Nip, you need
that manuscript, or can I take it?

353
00:19:19,524 --> 00:19:23,424
Take it. Take it.
And stop calling me Nip.

354
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:26,528
It was an accident.

355
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,561
Well, it's gotta be somewhere.
Look under his mattress.

356
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,249
About the focus group? I have nothing
to do with the focus group.

357
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,960
Oh, yeah.

358
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:04,633
He's sexual...

359
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,431
athletic and without a trace
of self-consciousness.

360
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,939
His buttocks are sublime.

361
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:13,510
His pectorals could use some work.
Get him into the weight room.

362
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:17,705
No. Let's get him in the studio today.
We could send these out immediately.

363
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,616
You've done it again, C.K.

364
00:20:24,689 --> 00:20:28,122
And what if I did do it? Even though
I admit to nothing and never will.

365
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,885
What does that make me?

366
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,963
I'm not just defending myself, but all
those pickers who have been caught.

367
00:20:34,466 --> 00:20:36,431
Each and every one of them...

368
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:41,903
who has to suffer the shame and
humiliation because of people like you.

369
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:46,874
Are we not human?
If we pick, do we not bleed?

370
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,108
I am not an animal.

371
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:56,777
I did not bare myself deliberately,
but I tell you, I wish now that I had.

372
00:20:56,855 --> 00:21:00,413
Because it is not me
that has been exposed, but you.

373
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:04,221
For I have seen the nipple
on your soul!

374
00:21:06,831 --> 00:21:09,399
So the minute I started up the steps
to her apartment...

375
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,159
I knew I made a terrible mistake.

376
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,638
Going back with her.

377
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,430
So we're in her apartment.
She goes into the bathroom.

378
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:21,375
I'm cursing myself.
Now how do I get out of there?

379
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,776
And then it hits me
like a bolt of lightning.

380
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:26,917
The pick.

381
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,320
- The pick?
- The pick?

382
00:21:30,588 --> 00:21:34,419
She comes out of the bathroom,
I'm in up to my wrist.

383
00:21:36,394 --> 00:21:39,463
You should've seen
the look on her face.

384
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,099
I think I've seen that look.

385
00:21:43,134 --> 00:21:46,226
Hey, I got the magazine.
The underwear ad came out.

386
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,304
Hey, Calvin Klein!

387
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,409
- Hey, you look great!
- Neat.

388
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,807
Boy, they really
worked on your pectorals.

389
00:21:54,879 --> 00:21:57,709
- Well.
- Your buttocks are spectacular.

390
00:21:57,782 --> 00:22:00,043
- Oh, my.
- What?

391
00:22:00,118 --> 00:22:04,120
Well, I'm not sure...

392
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:07,688
but I think I see your...

393
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:09,722
The human body
is a lot of maintenance.

394
00:22:09,794 --> 00:22:13,421
A lot of showering, a lot of shaving,
a lot of cleaning, a lot of clipping...

395
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:16,624
a lot of checking. If your body
was a car, you wouldn't buy it.

396
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:19,668
It's too much upkeep.
It's a pain.

397
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,500
But women definitely go
to the absolute extreme.

398
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:27,202
To me, it's amazing the way women
take care of all the hair on their bodies.

399
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:29,403
One of the
great mysteries to me...

400
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,573
is the fact that a woman
could pour hot wax on her legs...

401
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:37,744
rip the hair out by the root
and still be afraid of a spider.

402
