1
00:00:00,467 --> 00:00:02,457
I think the idea behind a tuxedo...

2
00:00:02,512 --> 00:00:05,187
is kind of the woman's point of
view that men are all the same.

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,274
We might as well
dress them that way.

4
00:00:08,043 --> 00:00:12,011
To me, a wedding is the joining
together of a beautiful, glowing bride...

5
00:00:12,081 --> 00:00:13,739
and some guy.

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,011
The tuxedo is a wedding safety
device, created by women...

7
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:20,246
because they know that men
are undependable.

8
00:00:20,456 --> 00:00:22,183
So in case the groom chickens out...

9
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:25,554
everybody takes one step over,
and she marries the next guy.

10
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:28,897
That's why the wedding vow isn't,
"Do you take Bill Simpson?"

11
00:00:28,964 --> 00:00:31,089
It's, "Do you take this man?"

12
00:00:37,106 --> 00:00:39,140
Leave a message.
I'll call you back. Thanks.

13
00:00:39,274 --> 00:00:42,901
Jerry? Joe Davola.

14
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:48,375
I have a hair on my tongue.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,847
Can't get it off.

16
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:52,009
You know how much I hate that?

17
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:55,415
Of course you do.
You put it there.

18
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:57,559
I know what you said about me,
Seinfeld.

19
00:00:57,626 --> 00:01:00,752
I know you bad-mouthed me
to the execs at NBC.

20
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,454
Put the kibosh on my deal.

21
00:01:03,532 --> 00:01:06,601
Now I'm gonna put the kibosh on you.

22
00:01:07,036 --> 00:01:09,070
You know I've kiboshed before.

23
00:01:09,638 --> 00:01:12,673
And I will kibosh again.

24
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:21,307
- So, what do you think?
- About what?

25
00:01:21,417 --> 00:01:23,485
- About the opera.
- I don't wanna go.

26
00:01:23,552 --> 00:01:25,950
- You gotta go.
- I don't like the opera.

27
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:28,919
What are they singing for?
Who sings?

28
00:01:29,158 --> 00:01:31,783
You got something to say, say it.

29
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:34,929
You don't understand.
That's the way they talk in Italy.

30
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:37,156
They sing to one another.

31
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:44,900
All right. All right.

32
00:01:44,973 --> 00:01:47,166
That's their way.
You listen to the language.

33
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,537
It's got that sing-songy quality to it.

34
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:52,009
It's the language, Jerry.
The language.

35
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:56,110
- So why don't they talk like that now?
- It's too hard to keep up.

36
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:58,879
You know, they got...
They were tired.

37
00:01:59,788 --> 00:02:01,185
- Better get that.
- Yeah.

38
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:03,483
- It's me.
- Come on up.

39
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,889
- So?
- I don't know.

40
00:02:05,961 --> 00:02:10,521
Come on. It's opening night.
Black-tie, Pagliacci. The great clown.

41
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:13,862
The great, sad, tragic clown,
like you.

42
00:02:15,337 --> 00:02:17,564
Well, that's very flattering.

43
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:19,866
How'd you get tickets?
They're impossible to get.

44
00:02:19,942 --> 00:02:22,101
Well, I have many associates.

45
00:02:23,278 --> 00:02:25,471
I don't know.
Opera, it's not my kind of thing.

46
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,740
Then I'm gonna call
the whole thing off.

47
00:02:27,816 --> 00:02:30,544
Wait a minute. What about
George, Susan and Elaine?

48
00:02:30,619 --> 00:02:32,744
- Why do you need me?
- You're the nucleus...

49
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:36,322
the straw that stirs the drink.
You're the "magliana."

50
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:39,083
I guess if I'm the magliana,
I should go.

51
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:41,092
All right. All right.

52
00:02:41,163 --> 00:02:42,560
- Good.
- Hey.

53
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:43,959
You got the tickets, right?

54
00:02:44,032 --> 00:02:47,795
- No, I don't have them on me.
- What? That's why I came over here.

55
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,097
My friend's got them.
I'll pick them up tomorrow.

56
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:54,402
I was gonna surprise Joey with them.
You got an extra one, right?

57
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,043
Oh, yeah!

58
00:02:56,111 --> 00:03:00,773
So I finally get to meet
your pal Joey.

59
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,375
- It's killing you, isn't it?
- Yeah.

60
00:03:03,452 --> 00:03:06,680
So Joey's a great lover of the opera.

61
00:03:06,755 --> 00:03:08,846
Listen...

62
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:11,024
I got news for you.

63
00:03:11,093 --> 00:03:13,024
It's nice to be involved
with somebody...

64
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:16,028
who's interested in something
other than Nick at Nite.

65
00:03:17,933 --> 00:03:19,933
You know, he's got a grip on reality.

66
00:03:20,002 --> 00:03:23,435
He's... He's happy. He's well-adjusted.

67
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,580
Looking forward to meeting him.

68
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,377
I gotta go.

69
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,213
Where? What's the rush?

70
00:03:38,287 --> 00:03:40,446
To surprise Joey.
I've never been to his place.

71
00:03:40,522 --> 00:03:43,557
- I'm just gonna pop in.
- Good, men love that.

72
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:47,593
Hey.

73
00:03:48,964 --> 00:03:50,793
You got a message, buddy.

74
00:03:50,866 --> 00:03:52,456
It could be from that blond.

75
00:03:55,938 --> 00:03:59,030
Jerry? Joe Davola.

76
00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:02,733
I have a hair on my tongue.

77
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:12,509
What am I gonna do?
He's gonna put the kibosh on me.

78
00:04:12,588 --> 00:04:16,647
- He's crazy, out of his mind!
- Steady, steady! Now, calm yourself!

79
00:04:16,725 --> 00:04:19,794
He's supposed to be on medication.
He told me he was on medication.

80
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:22,589
- What happened to his medication?
- Quiet! Now let me think.

81
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:25,694
I'm gonna call the cops.
That's what I'm doing. The cops.

82
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,902
Why?! They're not gonna
do anything!

83
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,901
They're the cops.
They gotta do something.

84
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:33,007
He'll put the kibosh on me. Do you
know what it is to be kiboshed?

85
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:37,440
- Kibosh.
- It's a terrible mistake.

86
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:41,013
He thinks I ruined some deal at NBC.
I don't know anything about it.

87
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:44,516
- Call and tell him that.
- That... That's what I'll do.

88
00:04:44,586 --> 00:04:48,713
I'll just call him and tell him.
That's all I'll do. Right.

89
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:52,516
He's a human being.
I'll talk to him. He'll understand, right?

90
00:04:52,594 --> 00:04:54,457
Yeah.

91
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,028
Don't mention my name.

92
00:04:59,268 --> 00:05:01,700
Oh, I got the machine.

93
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,395
- What's his message like?
- Nice.

94
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:06,673
Hello, Joe. Listen,
this is Jerry Seinfeld.

95
00:05:06,742 --> 00:05:10,505
I think there's been a huge, colossal
misunderstanding.

96
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:13,273
Big. Big.

97
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:15,848
If we could just talk,
we could straighten this out...

98
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:18,815
so call me back. Bye.

99
00:05:22,024 --> 00:05:23,648
Joey?

100
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,322
Joey?

101
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:48,744
Oh, God. It's you. You scared me.

102
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:51,613
Good. Fear's our most
primal emotion.

103
00:05:53,655 --> 00:05:55,450
You left your door open.

104
00:05:55,557 --> 00:05:58,251
I know. I like to encourage intruders.

105
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,457
What is all this?

106
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,895
Do you like it?

107
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:10,026
My home is a shrine to you.

108
00:06:10,672 --> 00:06:12,501
Where did you get all these pictures?

109
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:15,666
I took them myself
with a telephoto lens.

110
00:06:16,378 --> 00:06:19,208
Coming out of your office,
your apartment.

111
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:21,073
Shopping.

112
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,807
Showering.

113
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,944
Showering?

114
00:06:27,022 --> 00:06:28,851
I develop them myself
in my darkroom.

115
00:06:28,924 --> 00:06:31,219
Would you..? Would you like to see?

116
00:06:32,394 --> 00:06:35,292
In the darkroom?
Oh, no, thank you.

117
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:37,694
Not right now.

118
00:06:37,766 --> 00:06:40,892
I'm a day person.

119
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,370
Are..? Are you all right?

120
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:49,470
Why?

121
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:53,275
Well, I don't know.
You just don't...

122
00:06:53,348 --> 00:06:56,315
- seem yourself.
- Who am I?

123
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,647
- Who am I supposed to be?
- That's a good question.

124
00:07:00,722 --> 00:07:04,349
Good question. It's very existential.

125
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:08,087
Who are you? Who am I? Well...

126
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:09,925
What are you doing here?

127
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:12,828
Oh, nothing. I just stopped by
to chat.

128
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:15,333
You know, shoot the breeze.

129
00:07:15,404 --> 00:07:18,632
Were you able to get those Pagliacci
opera tickets from your friend?

130
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:20,536
I'm really looking forward to it.

131
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:26,605
No, he couldn't get them.
We're not going.

132
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:28,638
Really?

133
00:07:30,886 --> 00:07:34,319
Oh, damn it.
I just remembered I gotta go.

134
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:39,119
I left something on. The gas,
the lights, the water in the tub.

135
00:07:39,194 --> 00:07:42,161
Something is on somewhere,
so I'm just gonna get the...

136
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:47,258
Do you know the story of Pagliacci,
Nedda?

137
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:50,095
I'm Elaine.

138
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:53,240
He's a clown whose wife
is unfaithful to him.

139
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:57,844
Do you think I'm a clown, Nedda?

140
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:02,649
Do I think you're a clown?
No. Not if it's bad to be a clown.

141
00:08:02,717 --> 00:08:06,776
If it's bad to be a clown, then
you are definitely not a clown.

142
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:11,858
But if it's good to be a clown, then I
would have to rethink the whole thing.

143
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:15,425
You've betrayed me with another,
haven't you, Nedda?

144
00:08:15,497 --> 00:08:17,724
Who is he? I want you
to tell me who he is.

145
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:20,197
I want his name. Tell me his name.

146
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:23,963
Oh, like any man would
ever look at me. Come on.

147
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:26,334
I'm gonna get out of here.

148
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:28,476
Pagliacci kills his wife.

149
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:32,135
See? Now that's terrible. That is...
That's not a nice thing to do at all.

150
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:35,943
I would assume... I don't know how
this Pagliacci thing turns out.

151
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:40,076
But I would assume that there was
big, big trouble for that clown.

152
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,650
You're not leaving.

153
00:08:47,496 --> 00:08:49,393
But, officer, he threatened me.

154
00:08:49,464 --> 00:08:51,156
I don't understand.
That's not right.

155
00:08:51,233 --> 00:08:54,700
What if it was the president
of the U.S? I bet you'd investigate.

156
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:58,737
So, what's the difference?
I'm a comedian of the United States.

157
00:08:59,074 --> 00:09:01,938
And I'll tell you, I'm under
just as much pressure.

158
00:09:02,277 --> 00:09:05,642
All right. Thanks anyway.
Okay, bye.

159
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,410
- Who is it?
- It's George.

160
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,257
- You're locking the door now?
- Yeah.

161
00:09:28,436 --> 00:09:30,299
Well, well. Look at you.

162
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,602
It's a little skimpy there, isn't it?

163
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:38,441
You know the last time
I wore this thing?

164
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:39,841
Six years ago.

165
00:09:39,915 --> 00:09:42,313
When I made that toast
at Bobby Leighton's wedding.

166
00:09:42,384 --> 00:09:44,577
Oh, that was a bad toast.

167
00:09:44,653 --> 00:09:46,152
It wasn't that bad.

168
00:09:46,221 --> 00:09:48,846
I never heard anybody curse
in a toast.

169
00:09:49,491 --> 00:09:51,582
I was trying to loosen them up
a little bit.

170
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,489
There were old people there.

171
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:57,621
All the relatives.
You were like a Redd Foxx record.

172
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,595
At the end of the toast,
nobody even drank.

173
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:03,533
They were just standing. They were
just frozen. People...

174
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,836
That might have been
one of the worst all-time toasts.

175
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:11,240
Still, her father didn't have
to throw me out like that.

176
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:13,847
He could've asked me to leave.
He had me in a headlock.

177
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,683
Susan's not going tonight.

178
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:18,712
What do you mean, not going?
Why not?

179
00:10:18,787 --> 00:10:21,082
She had to pick up a friend
at the airport.

180
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:23,087
It cost me $100, this ticket.

181
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:26,022
- Why didn't she pay for hers?
- That's a very good question.

182
00:10:26,561 --> 00:10:29,459
She and I go to dinner,
she doesn't even reach for the check.

183
00:10:29,531 --> 00:10:32,293
All I'm asking for is a reach.
Is that so much to ask for?

184
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:34,128
It's nice to get a reach.

185
00:10:37,505 --> 00:10:40,369
- Who is it?
- It's me!

186
00:10:41,476 --> 00:10:44,044
Why are you locking the door now?

187
00:10:44,446 --> 00:10:45,945
Because of Davola. Get in here.

188
00:10:46,014 --> 00:10:48,082
What the..?

189
00:10:49,918 --> 00:10:52,543
- How come you're not dressed?
- I am dressed.

190
00:10:52,621 --> 00:10:55,519
- You're going like this?
- Yeah. I want you to hear something.

191
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,820
- You said people dress up for opera.
- Well, people do. I don't.

192
00:11:01,363 --> 00:11:03,931
If you're going like that,
I'm not going like this.

193
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:07,557
Wait a minute! Do you think
I'm comfortable here?

194
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:10,130
I can't change. I got no clothes here.

195
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:12,569
You gotta go like that.
I can't go like this alone.

196
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:15,608
Why should I be uncomfortable
because my apartment is closer?

197
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:17,836
That's not the issue. We're friends.

198
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:20,003
If I gotta be uncomfortable,
you gotta too.

199
00:11:20,081 --> 00:11:23,582
All right. I'll wear this. It's bad enough
I gotta go to the opera...

200
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:26,550
I gotta sit next to Ozzie Nelson
over here.

201
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:29,517
Would you turn that down?
What is that crap?

202
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,420
It's Pagliacci.

203
00:11:31,493 --> 00:11:33,083
Oh, beautiful.

204
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:35,729
We got a little problem here.
We got two extra tickets.

205
00:11:35,797 --> 00:11:38,092
- Why, what happened?
- Susan isn't going...

206
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:42,202
and Elaine's friend isn't going.
- Fantastic. We'll scalp the tickets.

207
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,930
We can make maybe 500 a ticket.

208
00:11:45,006 --> 00:11:46,539
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

209
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:49,233
People are looking for tickets here?

210
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:54,441
Are you kidding? Opening night,
Pavarotti in Pagliacci?

211
00:11:54,516 --> 00:11:57,710
- We're gonna clean up.
- Oh, man, I knew I'd love the opera.

212
00:11:57,786 --> 00:12:01,219
- Yeah, right.
- Come on, let's go get the tickets.

213
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,256
Listen, I gotta wait for Elaine.
I'll meet you at the theater.

214
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,256
- All right, yeah.
- Isn't scalping illegal?

215
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,258
Oh, yeah.

216
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,972
You sprayed him in the eyes
with Binaca?

217
00:12:31,453 --> 00:12:34,021
Cherry Binaca. It's new.

218
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:36,880
See, I don't get that.
First they come out with regular.

219
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,491
A year later, they have cherry.

220
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,891
They know we like cherry. Start with
cherry. Then come out with regular.

221
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:45,196
It was like I didn't know him.
He was a different person.

222
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,400
You should hear the message
from my nut.

223
00:12:48,036 --> 00:12:51,071
Where's George and Kramer?
I wanna get inside already.

224
00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:53,230
I feel very vulnerable.

225
00:12:54,075 --> 00:12:55,642
What you doing?
That's my quarter.

226
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,007
- No, it's not. It's mine.
- I was just flipping it. That's mine.

227
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,511
No, I dropped it. It's mine.

228
00:13:00,582 --> 00:13:04,015
All right, you want it, take it,
but don't try and tell me it's yours.

229
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:05,618
Well, it is mine.

230
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,749
What, you think I care
about the money?

231
00:13:07,822 --> 00:13:09,617
Is that what you think? I'll show you.

232
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:11,452
Look at this. Here's a dollar. Look.

233
00:13:11,526 --> 00:13:13,150
That's how much
I care about money.

234
00:13:13,228 --> 00:13:16,661
You think I care about money.
That's how much I care about money.

235
00:13:16,765 --> 00:13:18,696
- Why don't you get lost?
- Why don't you?

236
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:20,926
- Because I was standing here.
- Oh, yeah?

237
00:13:21,002 --> 00:13:22,694
Yeah.

238
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,110
I kind of like this opera crowd.
I feel tough.

239
00:13:32,714 --> 00:13:35,442
Anybody else got a problem?

240
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:40,784
- Hey, clown.
- Clown.

241
00:13:41,256 --> 00:13:43,221
Make us laugh, clown.

242
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,882
- Nice face, clown.
- Make me laugh, clown.

243
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,126
I got two. I got two. Pagliacci.

244
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,932
Who needs Pagliacci, huh?
Come on, the great tragic clown.

245
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:02,235
Come on, check it out. He laughs,
he cries, he sings. Pagliacci.

246
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,776
I got two beauties right here.
Check it out.

247
00:14:04,846 --> 00:14:06,880
- All right.
- Hey, hey, you selling?

248
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,572
I'm selling.

249
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:12,277
- Where are they?
- Orchestra, row G, dead center. Primo.

250
00:14:12,353 --> 00:14:14,819
You think you died
and went to heaven.

251
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:16,217
What do you want for them?

252
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:18,757
I'll tell you what I'll do.
You look like a nice guy.

253
00:14:18,927 --> 00:14:20,858
A thousand dollars for the deuce.

254
00:14:21,362 --> 00:14:23,760
- Give you $500 for the pair.
- Yeah. It's a deal.

255
00:14:23,832 --> 00:14:26,457
- No.
- What, no? Are you crazy?

256
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,933
- Look, let me handle this.
- That's $500. That's a great deal.

257
00:14:30,004 --> 00:14:32,038
You're blowing it.
The guy's a pigeon.

258
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:36,302
Oh, God, see, he's walking away.
What is wrong with you?

259
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:38,342
That was a $300 profit.

260
00:14:38,413 --> 00:14:40,174
I know what I'm doing here, George.

261
00:14:40,248 --> 00:14:43,442
This is not a Metallica concert.
It's an opera, all right?

262
00:14:43,518 --> 00:14:46,018
A little dignity. A little class.
Give me my ticket.

263
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:47,882
I will stand over here and sell it.

264
00:14:47,956 --> 00:14:50,251
Thank you. Stand over there.
I'll stand over here.

265
00:14:50,325 --> 00:14:52,450
- I know where I'm standing.
- All right.

266
00:14:52,527 --> 00:14:55,152
- Get your Pagliaccis here!
- Pagliaccis right here, huh?

267
00:14:55,496 --> 00:14:57,257
Where are they already?

268
00:14:57,332 --> 00:14:59,627
I guarantee you they don't
sell those tickets.

269
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:03,200
Hey, look. There's Bobby Leighton's
father-in-law. Mr. Reichman.

270
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:05,396
George and I were just talking
about him.

271
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,635
He threw George out of the wedding.

272
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:10,307
Oh, yeah, when George
made that bad toast.

273
00:15:10,378 --> 00:15:13,811
- You remember the curse toast?
- Oh, yeah. The curse toast.

274
00:15:13,915 --> 00:15:15,346
Can you believe that message?

275
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,746
I gotta spend my life looking
over my shoulder.

276
00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:19,784
Me too.

277
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,914
Crazy Joe Davola.

278
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:27,420
- How do you know his name?
- Why wouldn't I know his name?

279
00:15:27,729 --> 00:15:30,491
- I never told you his name.
- I never told you his name.

280
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:33,527
- Who are we talking about here?
- Joe Davola.

281
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:36,033
Right, Joe Davola.

282
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,329
How do you know his name?

283
00:15:38,806 --> 00:15:43,275
I've been out with him three times.
I should know the man's name.

284
00:15:43,845 --> 00:15:46,846
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- He's stalking you?

285
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:49,176
- Are you kidding me?
- You're dating the madman...

286
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,251
who's trying to kill me?
- Why didn't you tell me his name?

287
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,547
Last night he accused me
of seeing someone else.

288
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:57,020
- He said, "Tell me his name!"
- He said that?

289
00:15:57,091 --> 00:15:59,250
If he sees us, can you imagine
what he'll do?

290
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:01,861
If he thinks I ruined his NBC deal
and stole his girl!

291
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,965
- That will be a kibosh for sure.
- What about me?

292
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:06,725
Excuse me.

293
00:16:07,268 --> 00:16:09,802
Come on. This is Pavarotti.

294
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,605
Three hundred dollars.
That's a lot of money.

295
00:16:12,674 --> 00:16:15,834
Steven Holtzman did a production
in Tunis last year.

296
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,571
From what I understand,
the Muslims really took to it.

297
00:16:19,814 --> 00:16:23,816
I'll tell you what. You seem like a
nice guy. Let's stop jerking around.

298
00:16:24,152 --> 00:16:28,484
Give me $250. I got people waiting
for me. I gotta get the hell out of here.

299
00:16:28,656 --> 00:16:31,623
Scalping. I told them
to put on extra security.

300
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,226
Excuse me.

301
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:36,223
Pop, would you buzz off?
I got something cooking here.

302
00:16:36,297 --> 00:16:38,592
- Costanza?
- Mr. Reichman?

303
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,825
Still a sewer-mouth.
Give me those tickets.

304
00:16:40,902 --> 00:16:46,565
Harold, don't. Harold, be careful
of your hair transplant!

305
00:16:46,641 --> 00:16:49,232
Anything is welcome.
I accept change.

306
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:52,243
I don't have anything.
I gave it to that guy.

307
00:16:54,048 --> 00:16:56,514
You know, you could just say no.

308
00:16:56,584 --> 00:16:58,117
You don't have to humiliate me.

309
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:01,653
I may be dressed as a clown,
but I am a person.

310
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:04,348
- The guy took...
- I don't need people like you...

311
00:17:04,425 --> 00:17:06,083
looking down their noses at me.

312
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,253
I am just a street performer
trying to make enough to get by.

313
00:17:10,331 --> 00:17:12,899
Doctor, is there a doctor anywhere?

314
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,591
We need a doctor!

315
00:17:14,669 --> 00:17:18,136
What are you, showing off
for your girlfriend here, is that it?

316
00:17:18,206 --> 00:17:22,333
I'm not his girlfriend. We dated
for a while but things didn't work out.

317
00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:25,611
You people make me sick.

318
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,019
That is one angry clown.

319
00:17:32,086 --> 00:17:34,051
The hardest part
about being a clown...

320
00:17:34,122 --> 00:17:37,953
it seems to me, would be that you're
constantly referred to as a clown.

321
00:17:38,026 --> 00:17:40,560
"Who is that clown?
I'm not working with that clown.

322
00:17:40,628 --> 00:17:42,161
Did you hire that clown?

323
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:43,729
The guy's a clown."

324
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:45,796
How do you even start into
being a clown?

325
00:17:45,867 --> 00:17:47,696
How do you know you
wanna be a clown?

326
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:50,667
I guess you just get to a point
where your pants look so bad...

327
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:53,273
it's actually easier
to become a clown...

328
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:55,568
than having the proper alterations
done.

329
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:59,744
If you think about it, a clown,
if there isn't a circus around them...

330
00:17:59,814 --> 00:18:02,348
is really just a very annoying person.

331
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:05,884
I mean, you're in the back seat
of this guy's Volkswagen...

332
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:09,352
"What, you're picking somebody
else up? Oh, man."

333
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,816
I got one. Who needs one?
Pagliacci. Pagliacci.

334
00:18:13,127 --> 00:18:15,491
The tragic clown. Pagliacci...

335
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:21,797
What did you say?

336
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:24,464
What, are you a cop?

337
00:18:25,373 --> 00:18:27,202
No. I'm a clown.

338
00:18:28,776 --> 00:18:30,844
Man, you look familiar.

339
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:33,513
You ever been to the circus?

340
00:18:34,082 --> 00:18:36,548
- Well, when I was a kid.
- Did you like it?

341
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,185
Well, it was fun.

342
00:18:39,754 --> 00:18:42,414
Was kind of scared of the clowns.

343
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:46,224
Are you still scared of clowns?

344
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:49,086
Yeah.

345
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,097
We're gonna miss the overture.

346
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:59,638
Overture, curtains, lights
This is it, we'll hit the heights

347
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:05,973
And, oh, what heights we'll hit
On with the show, this is it

348
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:12,411
You know, it is so sad.

349
00:19:12,487 --> 00:19:15,613
All your knowledge of high culture
comes from Bugs Bunny cartoons.

350
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:20,886
Oh, there's that clown again.
What does he want from me?

351
00:19:21,095 --> 00:19:23,390
Look, I'm serious.
I don't have the quarter.

352
00:19:23,464 --> 00:19:26,124
- That guy took it.
- I don't want any money.

353
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:30,062
I smell cherry.

354
00:19:32,406 --> 00:19:34,940
- It's Binaca.
- Binaca?

355
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,242
Go! Go!

356
00:19:41,415 --> 00:19:44,916
- All right, what did we say, 275?
- Two fifty.

357
00:19:45,453 --> 00:19:48,920
- Two fifty? Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.

358
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:51,756
- All right. All right, 250.
- George!

359
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,361
- Susan.
- I don't believe it.

360
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,587
I'm so glad I caught you.

361
00:19:56,831 --> 00:19:59,491
What are you doing here?
You were going to the airport.

362
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,862
Some plane problems.
They landed in Philadelphia.

363
00:20:01,936 --> 00:20:04,869
So what? They don't have another
plane? She couldn't take a bus?

364
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:07,439
She's coming in tomorrow.
But I made it.

365
00:20:07,508 --> 00:20:09,735
Yeah. How about that? You made it.

366
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,209
I'm so excited. Now we get to see
the opera together.

367
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:16,873
We get to go to the opera...
Get out of here... Together.

368
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:19,542
- Who's that?
- That's, that's Harry Fong.

369
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:22,314
He's a very good friend of mine.
He's a big opera buff.

370
00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:25,152
Enjoy the show there, Harry!

371
00:20:25,293 --> 00:20:28,294
- Come on. Let's go.
- You know what?

372
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,953
- Come on. You gotta let us in.
- Not without tickets.

373
00:20:31,032 --> 00:20:32,997
We have tickets. Just not with us.

374
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:36,068
Well, that's a problem. Excuse me.

375
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:39,139
You don't understand.
Someone's after us, a crazy clown.

376
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:42,242
- He's trying to kill us!
- A crazy clown is after you?

377
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:44,810
Oh, that's rich.

378
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:47,106
Clear the way so people
with tickets can pass.

379
00:20:47,181 --> 00:20:49,146
- We're with him.
- Are you guys ready?

380
00:20:49,217 --> 00:20:50,875
- Yes. Yes.
- Have you seen George?

381
00:20:50,952 --> 00:20:53,520
- We thought he was with you.
- Come on. He's on his own.

382
00:20:53,588 --> 00:20:55,155
Here.

383
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,390
Here I come.

384
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,796
- These are great seats, huh?
- Yeah.

385
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:07,362
Boy, some cast, huh?
Pavarotti, Eva Marton.

386
00:21:07,435 --> 00:21:09,765
Eva Marton. I've heard of her.

387
00:21:09,837 --> 00:21:13,566
- Who's she playing?
- She's playing Pagliacci's wife, Nedda.

388
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:16,175
- Nedda?
- Yeah.

389
00:21:16,277 --> 00:21:17,571
Oh, my God.

390
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:21,146
Excuse me. Excuse me.

391
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:22,612
Excuse me.

392
00:21:22,683 --> 00:21:24,614
Excuse me.

393
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:37,087
Susan, what are you doing here?

394
00:21:37,164 --> 00:21:39,391
- My friend's flight couldn't make it.
- Hi.

395
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:42,331
- Where's George?
- I got his ticket.

396
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:45,233
He decided not to come.
He said he was uncomfortable.

397
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:46,839
Uncomfortable?

398
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:48,872
How do you think I feel?

399
00:21:50,011 --> 00:21:53,569
- How much did you pay for that ticket?
- One seventy-five.

400
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,482
Kramer, who did you sell
your ticket to?

401
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:01,644
Some nut in a clown suit.

402
00:22:08,663 --> 00:22:11,891
I had some friends drag me
to an opera recently.

403
00:22:11,966 --> 00:22:14,091
They've all got those little
opera glasses.

404
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:18,136
Do you really need binoculars?
How big do these people have to get...

405
00:22:18,372 --> 00:22:19,700
before you can spot them?

406
00:22:19,774 --> 00:22:25,107
These opera kids, they're going
250, 280, 325.

407
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,304
They're wearing
big white woolly vests.

408
00:22:27,381 --> 00:22:31,247
The women have the breastplates,
the bullet hats, the horns coming out.

409
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:33,649
You can't pick these people out,
forget opera.

410
00:22:33,721 --> 00:22:38,656
Think about optometry.
Maybe that's more your thing.

411
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:45,218
