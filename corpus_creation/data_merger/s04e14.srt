1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,851
What is with the age-gap hiring
policy at most movie theaters?

2
00:00:04,929 --> 00:00:08,123
They never hire anyone
between the ages of 15 and 80.

3
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,325
Know what I mean? The girl
that sells you the tickets, she's 10.

4
00:00:11,402 --> 00:00:14,494
Then there's the guy that rips it,
he's 102.

5
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:17,004
What happened in the middle?
Couldn't find anybody?

6
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:20,473
It's like they want to show you
how life comes full circle.

7
00:00:20,744 --> 00:00:23,074
You're 15. You're selling tickets.
Then you leave.

8
00:00:23,147 --> 00:00:26,307
You go out, you have a family, kids,
marriage, career, grandchildren.

9
00:00:26,383 --> 00:00:28,678
Eighty years later, you're back
at the same theater...

10
00:00:28,752 --> 00:00:30,649
3 feet away, ripping tickets.

11
00:00:30,721 --> 00:00:33,551
Took you 80 years
to move 3 feet.

12
00:00:38,896 --> 00:00:40,361
The show's delayed? Why?

13
00:00:40,431 --> 00:00:42,965
I don't know. Diane told me
to hold it for 15 minutes.

14
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:44,623
But I got this all timed out.

15
00:00:44,702 --> 00:00:47,771
I got another spot across town at 9:50.
I'm not gonna make it.

16
00:00:47,838 --> 00:00:50,133
- I hear you, guy.
- And I'm doing Letterman Monday.

17
00:00:50,207 --> 00:00:52,400
You know, I gotta work out
the material.

18
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:54,703
Let me see what I can do.

19
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,843
Oh, no, Buckles? You're not putting
him on tonight, are you?

20
00:00:59,917 --> 00:01:02,952
No. He hangs around in case
somebody drops out.

21
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,089
Look, why don't you come back
and do the 11:00 spot.

22
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:10,215
I was supposed to meet my friends
to see this movie Checkmate at 10:30.

23
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:14,392
All right, forget the movie.
I'll do the 11:00 spot. I'll be back.

24
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,931
- Hey, Jer.
- Hey.

25
00:01:24,975 --> 00:01:27,543
Excuse me. Do you have a ticket?

26
00:01:27,611 --> 00:01:30,339
- No.
- Okay. Good.

27
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,150
You missed your spot. It was 9:15.

28
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:37,787
But, Maurice, I'm positive
you told me 9:50.

29
00:01:37,855 --> 00:01:41,550
In any event, I had no alternative
but to reassign your spot...

30
00:01:41,625 --> 00:01:45,627
to one of your peers who possesses
a clearer understanding...

31
00:01:45,696 --> 00:01:48,390
of our scheduling policies.

32
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:53,259
- Jerry!
- What are you doing here?

33
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:55,166
Hey, do you think this is funny?

34
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,506
Why do they call it "athlete's foot"?

35
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:59,505
You don't have to be
an athlete to get it.

36
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:04,170
I mean, my father gets it all the time
and, believe me, he's no athlete.

37
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,474
- I gotta go.
- Wait. Where?

38
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:07,514
- The movies.
- I thought you told Kernis...

39
00:02:07,584 --> 00:02:09,413
you were going back
to do the 11:00.

40
00:02:09,486 --> 00:02:12,180
I'm just gonna stop by
and tell my friends I can't make it.

41
00:02:12,256 --> 00:02:15,416
- Cool. I'll split a cab with you.
- I could be a while over there.

42
00:02:15,492 --> 00:02:19,426
I got time. It'll give us a chance to
get to know each other a little better.

43
00:02:25,102 --> 00:02:26,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

44
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:29,964
- Where is everybody?
- Everybody's late.

45
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Because they know
I'll get in line early.

46
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:34,905
I've been dying to see Checkmate.

47
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:37,808
Well, if it's as good as
Ponce de León, I'll be happy.

48
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:42,111
Ponce de León? Are you kidding me?
I hated that movie.

49
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:44,686
Ponce de León?
But that was great.

50
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:46,379
Oh, come on.

51
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,422
That fountain of youth scene
at the end...

52
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:50,184
where they're splashing around...

53
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,420
and they go running over to the
mirror to see if it really worked.

54
00:02:53,497 --> 00:02:55,462
I mean, come on.

55
00:02:56,433 --> 00:02:58,023
It's so stupid.

56
00:02:58,102 --> 00:02:59,726
Let me tell you something:

57
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:03,031
When Ponce looked in that mirror
and saw that he hadn't changed...

58
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:07,234
and that tear started to roll
down his cheek, I lost it.

59
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:09,242
- Oh, there you are.
- Where have you been?

60
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:11,506
Around the corner
at the Paradise Twin.

61
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:14,674
- Well, I told you the Paragon.
- No, you said Paradise.

62
00:03:14,752 --> 00:03:18,083
- It's playing there too, you know.
- No. I would not have said Paradise.

63
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:21,156
That's a twin theater. I want to see
this movie on a big screen.

64
00:03:21,225 --> 00:03:23,020
I'm gonna get a hot dog
at Papaya King.

65
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:26,162
- You'll never make it back in time.
- I haven't had any dinner.

66
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,991
You can get a hot dog
at the theater.

67
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:30,656
I don't want a movie dog.
I want a Papaya King hot dog.

68
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:32,768
Kramer, Jerry is gonna
be here any second.

69
00:03:32,836 --> 00:03:36,428
Then this line's gonna start moving,
and we'll end up in the front row.

70
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,973
- Just save me a seat.
- No, I don't wanna save seats.

71
00:03:39,042 --> 00:03:40,404
Don't put me through that.

72
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:42,977
I once had the fleece ripped out
of my winter coat...

73
00:03:43,046 --> 00:03:44,704
in a seat-saving incident.

74
00:03:44,782 --> 00:03:47,350
- Give me my ticket, then.
- Well, I don't have them yet.

75
00:03:48,185 --> 00:03:49,752
You don't have them yet?

76
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,547
Well, I'm in line to buy.

77
00:03:51,622 --> 00:03:54,520
No, George,
this is a ticket-holders' line.

78
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,921
No, it's not.
It's the ticket-buyers' line.

79
00:03:56,994 --> 00:03:59,289
- Then how come we're not moving?
- Good question.

80
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:03,689
Is this the ticket-holders' line
or the buyers'?

81
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,600
Holders'.

82
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,533
When I asked you before
if you had a ticket, you said no.

83
00:04:08,605 --> 00:04:11,469
I didn't. My friend was getting it.

84
00:04:11,675 --> 00:04:14,539
That's good.
It's good to be accurate.

85
00:04:14,611 --> 00:04:16,372
Stay here. I'll go get tickets.

86
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:18,609
- Can you believe him?
- He spaced out.

87
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,018
And how long would you have stood
in the ticket-holders' line?

88
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:24,713
Yeah, exactly.

89
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:27,256
It's sold out.

90
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:30,552
Oh, real good, George.
Real good.

91
00:04:30,627 --> 00:04:32,592
Hey, I asked the guy
if he had a ticket.

92
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,163
- All right, what time is it?
- Twenty after 10.

93
00:04:35,232 --> 00:04:37,425
They got one at the
Paradise at 10:45.

94
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:40,866
No, I don't wanna go to
a miniplex multi-theater.

95
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:43,336
It's the same movie.
What's the difference?

96
00:04:43,407 --> 00:04:44,804
No, it's not a theater.

97
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:49,639
It's a room where they bring in POWs
to show them propaganda films.

98
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:51,912
All right, I'm going.

99
00:04:51,982 --> 00:04:53,310
It's in Dolby.

100
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:55,417
Well, what about Jerry?

101
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:57,451
You go get the tickets.
I'll wait for him.

102
00:04:57,521 --> 00:05:00,112
- Terrific. All right, come on.
- All right.

103
00:05:07,764 --> 00:05:10,389
So then, when I was 12,
the whole family moved...

104
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:13,559
from Bensonhurst
to Sheepshead Bay.

105
00:05:14,037 --> 00:05:15,798
We were right on the water.

106
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:19,306
The whole atmosphere
stunk from fish.

107
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:21,774
You know that fishy smell
I'm talking about?

108
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:23,879
Yeah, yeah. The fishy smell.

109
00:05:23,947 --> 00:05:25,708
To this day I won't eat fish.

110
00:05:25,782 --> 00:05:29,374
- Do you eat fish?
- Yes! Yes, I eat fish!

111
00:05:29,453 --> 00:05:31,953
- I don't know how you eat that crap.
- Take the Park.

112
00:05:32,022 --> 00:05:33,680
No, no, take 55th.

113
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:35,415
No, there's beautiful homes there.

114
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:38,459
There's lovely, talented,
attractive people.

115
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:39,857
You'll thank me.

116
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,362
Jerry, I want you to do me a favor:

117
00:05:42,432 --> 00:05:43,897
No more fish.

118
00:05:44,134 --> 00:05:46,202
Okay. I get your point.

119
00:05:46,336 --> 00:05:47,664
I have a point?

120
00:05:51,275 --> 00:05:53,502
- Got them.
- Beautiful.

121
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,668
Hey, you know what else
is playing here?

122
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,473
Rochelle Rochelle.

123
00:05:57,548 --> 00:05:59,275
- I wouldn't mind seeing that.
- Yeah.

124
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:01,940
Men can sit through the most
pointless, boring movie...

125
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:05,816
if there's the slightest possibility
that a woman will take her top off.

126
00:06:07,024 --> 00:06:08,648
So, what's your point?

127
00:06:09,726 --> 00:06:11,316
By the way, you owe me $7.50.

128
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,991
- All right. Can you break a 20?
- No. I don't have any change.

129
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:17,165
Well, then I'll pay you later.

130
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:20,092
Or I could take the 20,
and I could pay you later.

131
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:22,001
Yeah, you could.

132
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:23,903
Might be easier.

133
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:27,333
Well, how's that easier? I mean,
then you would owe me $12.50...

134
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:29,376
instead of me owing you $7.50.

135
00:06:30,647 --> 00:06:33,341
- Either way.
- Yeah, it's the same thing.

136
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:37,911
So can I have it?

137
00:06:39,056 --> 00:06:42,125
I tell you what, I'll get
the popcorn and the soda.

138
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:44,859
What do you mean,
you'll get the popcorn and the soda?

139
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:49,195
I will buy your popcorn and soda,
and we'll call it even.

140
00:06:49,266 --> 00:06:52,301
Tell you what. Give me the 20,
I'll buy you a popcorn and soda...

141
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:56,098
and I'll throw in a bonbons.
- George, you're sapping my strength.

142
00:06:56,173 --> 00:06:58,104
Come on. Go.

143
00:06:58,408 --> 00:07:00,066
What about Kramer and Jerry?

144
00:07:00,143 --> 00:07:02,234
I'll wait here for them.
You go save seats.

145
00:07:02,312 --> 00:07:04,880
Me? But that's three seats.
I can't save three seats.

146
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:07,175
I told you about that guy
who tore up my coat.

147
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:10,547
- Save them, go.
- No, but George...

148
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,051
Fifty-Fifth Street. Great idea.

149
00:07:19,129 --> 00:07:21,424
Saturday night, theater traffic.
Good move.

150
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:24,328
I wonder how Ike Turner
would react in traffic.

151
00:07:24,401 --> 00:07:27,163
"You better move that car, girl,
before I bust you up."

152
00:07:27,237 --> 00:07:29,862
And what about Jose Feliciano?

153
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,635
"It's not bad enough that I can't see,
I have to sit here for two hours.

154
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,175
I don't think so."

155
00:07:35,245 --> 00:07:36,573
It can be anybody.

156
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:40,012
People down through history
reacting in traffic.

157
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,844
Franklin Roosevelt:

158
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,283
- "Driver..."
- All right, all right. I got the bit.

159
00:07:45,522 --> 00:07:48,785
Jerry, I want you to have
this piece of material.

160
00:07:48,859 --> 00:07:50,859
That's nice of you.
I can't do the voices.

161
00:07:50,927 --> 00:07:52,995
Jerry, don't start up with me.

162
00:07:53,063 --> 00:07:55,131
I gotta get out of this cab.

163
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:56,890
But, Jerry, we're riffing.

164
00:07:56,967 --> 00:08:02,061
No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring.
Do you understand the difference?

165
00:08:03,306 --> 00:08:06,034
Can you help me
get on The Tonight Show?

166
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,306
No, these are saved.

167
00:08:11,381 --> 00:08:12,607
- All of them?
- Yeah.

168
00:08:12,683 --> 00:08:15,308
- You can't take four seats.
- What, is that a rule?

169
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:21,881
- Are these your things?
- Yeah.

170
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:24,686
Elaine, I can't wait anymore.
I'm gonna miss the beginning.

171
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:27,955
Well, we'll take these seats.
Would you please remove your stuff?

172
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:30,827
- No, no, they'll be here.
- But I am here. They are not.

173
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:33,595
They're coming. George, listen,
run over to the Paragon...

174
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:36,295
and give Kramer the two tickets
so they can come in.

175
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,963
These are taken. Taken.

176
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,371
If you hurry back,
you won't miss the beginning.

177
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:44,171
You go, and I could save the seats.
You don't like saving anyway.

178
00:08:44,381 --> 00:08:48,474
No, taken! Taken, taken.
I'm getting the hang of it.

179
00:08:48,552 --> 00:08:51,246
Why don't you give me the 20,
I'll stop and get change...

180
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:53,480
and then you and I can,
you know, settle up.

181
00:08:53,557 --> 00:08:54,988
Can we do this later, George?

182
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,991
What's the point
of discussing it anymore.

183
00:08:58,061 --> 00:09:00,925
You'll give me the money
when you have it.

184
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,328
I trust you.

185
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,107
Will you do me a favor?

186
00:09:17,314 --> 00:09:19,109
You see a guy who's
about 5 foot 11...

187
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:21,580
he's got a big head
and flared nostrils...

188
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:24,549
tell him his friend's gonna be
right back, okay?

189
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,184
No, I'm sorry. These are taken.

190
00:09:28,258 --> 00:09:31,054
They're in the lobby buying popcorn.

191
00:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,059
What are you doing?
These are taken!

192
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,596
- Which one?
- These two and this one.

193
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,630
No, don't come over here!
These are taken.

194
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,701
Go! Go! These are taken.

195
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,634
They're taken! They're taken!

196
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:45,267
Oh, take them.

197
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:55,040
Excuse me, have you
seen a guy with, like...

198
00:09:55,118 --> 00:09:58,381
a horse face, big teeth
and a pointed nose?

199
00:09:58,588 --> 00:10:00,815
- Flared nostrils?
- Yeah.

200
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,788
Nope. Haven't seen him.

201
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:13,564
Jerry, could you do me
a personal favor?

202
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:16,729
And if I'm out of line,
please let me know.

203
00:10:16,807 --> 00:10:20,570
Could I keep my trench coat
in your closet for a few months?

204
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,234
Your trench coat in my closet?

205
00:10:22,312 --> 00:10:24,778
Jerry, my closet is packed to the gills.

206
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:26,643
I'm afraid to open the door.

207
00:10:26,716 --> 00:10:28,408
Just for a few months.

208
00:10:28,485 --> 00:10:30,644
It'll make all the difference
in the world.

209
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,651
I can't keep your coat in my closet.

210
00:10:32,722 --> 00:10:35,313
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Well, that's how I feel.

211
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:38,290
Hey, your friends aren't here.

212
00:10:38,762 --> 00:10:42,195
They must be inside. I'm gonna run in
and tell them I can't make the movie.

213
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:46,096
We should go see Rochelle Rochelle.
I hear it's really hot.

214
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:49,204
- No, thanks. Maybe some other time.
- Really? Do you mean that?

215
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:51,036
No, I don't.

216
00:10:51,107 --> 00:10:53,437
But you like the athlete's-foot bit,
right?

217
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,773
No. No. I was kidding.
It was terrible.

218
00:10:56,847 --> 00:10:58,414
Here you go. I'll see you later.

219
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,776
- Do you want me to wait for you?
- No. Don't wait.

220
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:04,045
Jerry, I'll wait just to make sure
you get in, that's all.

221
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,415
I got friends inside
I need to get a message to.

222
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:08,648
You mind if I walk through
real quick?

223
00:11:09,326 --> 00:11:10,791
Go ahead.

224
00:11:10,861 --> 00:11:12,792
Bye-bye.

225
00:11:13,196 --> 00:11:15,196
Hey, did that guy show up?

226
00:11:15,265 --> 00:11:18,528
The guy with the horse face
and the big teeth?

227
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:21,136
No, the guy with the big head
and the flared nostrils.

228
00:11:21,404 --> 00:11:23,438
Haven't seen him.

229
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:26,541
There was a short guy with glasses...

230
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:29,873
looked like Humpty-Dumpty
with a melon head.

231
00:11:29,946 --> 00:11:31,741
But he left.

232
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:36,814
So I got home,
and he was vacuuming.

233
00:11:36,887 --> 00:11:38,784
I mean, he's 12 years old.

234
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:42,049
Who else but my Alan
would do something like that?

235
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:45,786
And then last night,
he put on my high heels.

236
00:11:45,862 --> 00:11:47,725
He put on such a show for us.

237
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:50,991
He was dancing around,
lip-synching to A Chorus Line.

238
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,725
I mean, you can see
he's got talent.

239
00:11:52,802 --> 00:11:54,961
Excuse me. Excuse me.

240
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:56,571
What's the problem?

241
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,173
You're talking.

242
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:01,071
It's the coming attractions.

243
00:12:01,144 --> 00:12:03,804
So anyway, he sings, he dances.

244
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,709
And you know what
he's gotten into now?

245
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:08,578
He is cooking. He does a great...

246
00:12:10,353 --> 00:12:12,114
Ticket, sir?

247
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:14,719
I just went out.
I went to look for my friend.

248
00:12:14,791 --> 00:12:16,119
Do you have your stub?

249
00:12:16,192 --> 00:12:18,192
My stub?

250
00:12:18,662 --> 00:12:20,730
Who keeps the stub?

251
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,161
No one holds on to the stub.

252
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:27,201
I'm going to the movies for 25 years,
nobody ever asked me for the stub.

253
00:12:27,871 --> 00:12:30,735
- You don't remember me?
- It's a big city, sir.

254
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,238
I went in with a pretty woman.

255
00:12:32,309 --> 00:12:35,105
You know, short, big wall of hair,
face like a frying pan.

256
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:36,540
Nope.

257
00:12:39,382 --> 00:12:42,212
- I can't find it.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

258
00:12:43,787 --> 00:12:48,051
All right. Here. It's my friend's ticket.

259
00:12:59,302 --> 00:13:01,199
Elaine?

260
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:06,672
- Elaine?
- Sit down!

261
00:13:08,211 --> 00:13:10,472
- Elaine?
- Hey, shut up!

262
00:13:10,547 --> 00:13:11,909
I'm looking for my friend.

263
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:13,913
Check the bathroom.
You're bothering us.

264
00:13:13,984 --> 00:13:16,416
I know my friend's here.
What do you want me to do?

265
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:17,848
You can shut up!

266
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,482
- Elaine?
- Shut up!

267
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,591
Elaine?

268
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:34,767
Elaine?

269
00:13:35,271 --> 00:13:38,636
The Village Voice calls it
a masterpiece.

270
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:43,108
A young woman's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.

271
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:49,047
It's a story about life and love
and becoming a woman.

272
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,414
Rochelle Rochelle.

273
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:54,716
Now playing at the Paradise Two.

274
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:24,609
Thank you.

275
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:26,353
Can I have a medium Diet Coke?

276
00:14:26,423 --> 00:14:29,390
- You want the medium or middle size?
- What's the difference?

277
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:31,857
Well, we have three sizes:
medium, large and jumbo.

278
00:14:31,928 --> 00:14:33,359
What happened to the small?

279
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,225
There is no small. Small's medium.

280
00:14:35,732 --> 00:14:37,322
So, what's medium?

281
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,024
Medium's large,
and large is jumbo.

282
00:14:39,369 --> 00:14:41,937
- Okay, give me the large.
- That's medium.

283
00:14:42,305 --> 00:14:44,771
Right. Yeah.
Can I have a small popcorn?

284
00:14:44,841 --> 00:14:47,273
There is no small.
Child-size is small.

285
00:14:47,343 --> 00:14:49,673
- What's medium?
- Adult.

286
00:14:49,913 --> 00:14:54,143
- Do adults ever order the child-size?
- Not usually.

287
00:14:54,317 --> 00:14:56,578
- Okay, give me the adult.
- Do you want butter?

288
00:14:56,653 --> 00:14:58,846
- Is it real butter?
- It's butter flavoring.

289
00:14:58,922 --> 00:15:00,683
Yeah, well, what is it made of?

290
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,415
It's yellow.

291
00:15:09,232 --> 00:15:13,393
Thanks. Thank you. You don't know
how long I've been waiting out there.

292
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,869
Very busy tonight. Very busy.
Where you go?

293
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,974
Forty-Fourth and 9th.

294
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:21,940
- Have you got a cigarette?
- No.

295
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:24,104
Ticket, sir?

296
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,778
We've just been through this.

297
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,647
You don't remember? We just had
this exact conversation a minute ago.

298
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,117
I need to see your stub.

299
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,550
I got the stub. I got the stub.

300
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:40,662
I put it right in my pocket.
I got the...

301
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:43,155
I'm telling you, I got the stub.
I just...

302
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:46,928
- I don't know where it is.
- I can't let you in without your stub.

303
00:15:47,003 --> 00:15:50,800
You just let me in.
We just did this a minute ago!

304
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,007
All right. Okay. There.
There you go, okay?

305
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,045
That's my other friend's ticket.
Happy now?

306
00:15:59,115 --> 00:16:02,275
You got two tickets.
Two of my friends.

307
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:08,351
Ticket, sir?

308
00:16:08,424 --> 00:16:11,925
No, see, my friend bought me a ticket.
See, I'm late. She's already inside.

309
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,790
- Go ahead. Enjoy the movie.
- Thanks.

310
00:16:20,837 --> 00:16:22,768
- What is it, Your Majesty?
- Anyone asks...

311
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,963
- Is that seat taken?
- It's all yours.

312
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,575
When I tell you something,
you damn better well listen.

313
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:30,770
- I'm getting tired of these questions.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

314
00:16:30,847 --> 00:16:34,883
I'm sorry, Grendel, I...
I've been very taxed lately.

315
00:16:35,218 --> 00:16:37,513
Yeah, I'm very sorry.
You give me a few minutes.

316
00:16:37,587 --> 00:16:39,678
I have to stop for gasoline.

317
00:16:39,756 --> 00:16:41,983
Gasoline? Can't you get it
after you drop me off?

318
00:16:42,058 --> 00:16:46,788
No. Impossible.
It is on empty. See.

319
00:16:46,863 --> 00:16:49,727
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

320
00:16:51,868 --> 00:16:54,061
What happened to my seat?

321
00:16:54,137 --> 00:16:56,137
Oh, my God, where was I?

322
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:59,207
- Hey, sit down. I can't see.
- Get out of the way.

323
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,637
I can't find my seat.

324
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,574
- Just move!
- No, you move!

325
00:17:03,646 --> 00:17:05,907
Get the hell out of here!

326
00:17:09,352 --> 00:17:11,579
Come, come, you're soaking wet.
Come in.

327
00:17:11,654 --> 00:17:13,813
My name is Rochelle.
I'm from Milan.

328
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,924
I'm supposed to visit
my relatives in Minsk.

329
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:17,423
Yes. Come by the fire.

330
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,686
Take off those wet clothes.
You'll catch cold.

331
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:23,696
My hands are so cold,
I can barely get these buttons open.

332
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,861
That's much better.
Much, much better.

333
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:38,039
Listen, I just went
to go get popcorn and...

334
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:41,672
God. I just went to go
get popcorn, okay...

335
00:17:41,751 --> 00:17:44,684
and somebody took my seat,
and my coat is in there.

336
00:17:44,754 --> 00:17:46,446
There's a seat in the front row.

337
00:17:46,522 --> 00:17:48,522
No, no, I can't sit in the front row.

338
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:50,181
You're gonna have to wait then.

339
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,726
I can't stand around here
for two hours.

340
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:55,295
I can let you see
Rochelle Rochelle.

341
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,229
Thanks.

342
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:01,333
Hey, listen, by the way...

343
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,439
have you seen
a tall, lanky doofus...

344
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:08,566
with a bird face and hair like
the Bride of Frankenstein?

345
00:18:09,012 --> 00:18:10,875
Haven't seen him.

346
00:18:11,347 --> 00:18:12,812
Okay.

347
00:18:14,851 --> 00:18:16,418
Let's go. I'm gonna miss my spot.

348
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,178
Yes, yes, we go. We go.

349
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,618
One minute. I run across
the street for cigarettes.

350
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,781
I don't have time.
I'm gonna miss my spot.

351
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:26,258
No, no. We go very soon.

352
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,894
I didn't know you enjoyed chess,
Your Majesty.

353
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:31,465
Why wouldn't I?

354
00:18:31,534 --> 00:18:34,102
Well, because the king
is always in jeopardy.

355
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,135
Yes, but it's only a game.

356
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:40,002
Yes, of course. Only a game.

357
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:48,312
- Hey, did I make it?
- Sorry.

358
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:52,011
Great. That's great. What a night.

359
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,712
Pat Buckles, ladies and gentlemen.

360
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,586
Another round of applause
for Pat Buckles.

361
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:58,192
Good set.

362
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,692
You got my spot?

363
00:18:59,762 --> 00:19:03,093
- That athlete's-foot bit killed.
- Really?

364
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,360
- You think I need to lose some weight?
- Weight? No.

365
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,470
You just need some height.

366
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:11,539
Jerry, don't start up with me.
What are you doing now?

367
00:19:11,607 --> 00:19:13,538
What am I doing?
My whole night's ruined.

368
00:19:13,609 --> 00:19:15,836
I didn't do any sets.
I didn't go to the movies.

369
00:19:15,912 --> 00:19:18,503
Come on. We can still catch
most of Rochelle Rochelle.

370
00:19:18,581 --> 00:19:19,841
Rochelle Rochelle?

371
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:24,686
A young girl's strange, erotic
journey from Milan to Minsk.

372
00:19:24,887 --> 00:19:26,545
Minsk?

373
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:29,355
My father was a shoemaker.

374
00:19:29,425 --> 00:19:31,516
He worked hard,
and we didn't have much money.

375
00:19:31,594 --> 00:19:33,992
Rochelle, Rochelle,
what are we going to do with you?

376
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:36,563
- I'm going away tomorrow.
- Where? Where are you going?

377
00:19:36,632 --> 00:19:38,461
I want to go with you.
Take me with you.

378
00:19:38,534 --> 00:19:39,931
Well, don't be a silly goose.

379
00:19:40,002 --> 00:19:43,196
But I've never seen Minsk. I hear
there's so much hustle and bustle.

380
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:45,840
You're being absurd.
Leave me alone.

381
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:49,700
- Rochelle, Rochelle, do you know..?
- Give me a break!

382
00:19:52,248 --> 00:19:54,213
Elaine?

383
00:19:55,218 --> 00:19:57,252
- Jerry.
- Elaine.

384
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,547
- Shut up.
- Jerry?

385
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:02,823
- George?
- Elaine?

386
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:04,220
George.

387
00:20:04,293 --> 00:20:06,623
- But where's Kramer?
- Will you shut up?

388
00:20:06,696 --> 00:20:09,424
I don't know.
Does this movie stink or what?

389
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,090
Let's get out of here. I'll see you.

390
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,530
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

391
00:20:13,603 --> 00:20:17,070
Jerry, take the coat.
Please. One month.

392
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,470
I don't want the coat.

393
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:24,074
Jerry, call me when you get home,
so I know you're okay.

394
00:20:24,414 --> 00:20:27,074
- What happened to you?
- I missed you at the other theater.

395
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,377
Then I missed my set,
and I had nothing to do.

396
00:20:29,452 --> 00:20:31,486
Man. Look at this.

397
00:20:31,554 --> 00:20:33,212
I sat in gum.

398
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:34,583
What happened to Checkmate?

399
00:20:34,657 --> 00:20:38,249
Oh, I went out to get popcorn,
and some creep took my seat.

400
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:40,292
Hey, by the way,
you owe me $7.50.

401
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:43,864
- But I didn't even use the ticket.
- I still paid for it.

402
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,564
- I only have a 20.
- Hi.

403
00:20:46,636 --> 00:20:48,397
- Hey!
- What happened to you?

404
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:52,007
That's my coat. Give me that.
Where did you get that?

405
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,607
It was on the seat.

406
00:20:53,676 --> 00:20:55,175
You took my seat?

407
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:58,177
- You owe me $7.50.
- Yeah. Right.

408
00:20:58,748 --> 00:21:01,476
What is this stain?

409
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,246
It's yellow mustard.
Can you break a 20?

410
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:09,118
But I always get confused
in the movie theater by the plot.

411
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:12,989
It's embarrassing to have to admit,
but I'm the one you see...

412
00:21:13,062 --> 00:21:16,620
in the parking lot, after the movie,
talking with his friends, going:

413
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:20,565
"You mean, that was the same guy
from the beginning?"

414
00:21:22,872 --> 00:21:27,068
Nobody will explain it to you.
In the theater, you can't find out.

415
00:21:27,143 --> 00:21:29,438
Why did they kill that guy?

416
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,113
Why did they kill him?

417
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:36,142
Who was that guy?
Who was that guy?

418
00:21:36,385 --> 00:21:39,682
I thought he was with them.
Wasn't he with them?

419
00:21:39,755 --> 00:21:42,585
Why would they kill him
if he was with them?

420
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:46,461
Oh, he wasn't really with them.

421
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:48,756
I thought he was with them.

422
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:52,227
It's a good thing they killed him.

423
00:21:53,305 --> 00:21:59,549
