1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,411
I don't belong to a health club. I have a
limit on naked men I see in one day.

2
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,209
Zero.

3
00:00:08,284 --> 00:00:10,147
That's it.

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,345
What is with the high level of security
at health clubs, you know?

5
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:15,854
The picture IDs. Security guards.
Signing in and out.

6
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:17,686
What is this, the Kremlin?

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,355
I mean, the people with a membership
go twice a year. Who's breaking in?

8
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:27,193
Is this a big problem,
people stealing exercise?

9
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:30,465
And what if they catch the person?
What then? They run. It's aerobic.

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,609
Makes it even worse.

11
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:41,916
- Hi, Jerry.
- Oh, hi, Sidra.

12
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:44,179
I last about 10 minutes
on the StairMaster.

13
00:00:44,255 --> 00:00:48,224
Unless someone's stretching in front of
me in a leotard, then I can go an hour.

14
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:51,025
- Really?
- That's why it's called the StairMaster.

15
00:00:51,096 --> 00:00:53,187
You get up there and you stare.

16
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:57,194
Well, I'm done.
I think I'm gonna go take a sauna.

17
00:00:57,269 --> 00:00:58,802
I'll see you Thursday night?

18
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:00,370
- Thursday night.
- Okay.

19
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:04,100
Good workout?

20
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:06,472
Tremendous workout.

21
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:10,373
- It's a pretty girl.
- Tremendous girl.

22
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:13,644
- She the one you went out with?
- Yeah. I really like her.

23
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:17,222
You know, they're fake.

24
00:01:19,293 --> 00:01:22,055
- What? Don't say that.
- No. They're fake.

25
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:24,220
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

26
00:01:24,298 --> 00:01:27,094
You know how you always brag
how you can spot a lesbian?

27
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:30,904
I'm not bragging. I happen to
have a very keen lesbian eye.

28
00:01:30,973 --> 00:01:33,439
Hi, how you doing?

29
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:36,076
Oh, right.

30
00:01:36,144 --> 00:01:40,010
Come on. Don't you think
they seem just a bit too perfect?

31
00:01:40,083 --> 00:01:42,174
Yes, they do.

32
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:46,586
I never knew you were into breasts.
Thought you were a leg man.

33
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:51,523
Leg man? Why would I be a leg man?
I don't need legs. I have legs.

34
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,230
Have you seen her naked
in the locker room?

35
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:57,230
- No.
- Then I can't accept your testimony.

36
00:01:57,301 --> 00:01:58,732
Maybe if you'd seen her naked.

37
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:01,132
- I don't wanna see her naked.
- Well, I do.

38
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,239
Well, that's your problem.

39
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:06,376
Look, you made the allegation.
The least you could do is follow up.

40
00:02:06,845 --> 00:02:10,608
Jerry, what am I gonna do? Go in
there and spy on her in the sauna?

41
00:02:10,682 --> 00:02:14,582
Yes. Go in there. Do a little
investigative journalism.

42
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:15,981
I need to know.

43
00:02:16,054 --> 00:02:19,214
But a few more dates,
you can find out for yourself.

44
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:21,121
Don't be so sure. Look at George.

45
00:02:21,193 --> 00:02:23,989
He's on his ninth date with Betsy.
Still hasn't got anywhere.

46
00:02:24,063 --> 00:02:25,391
What's his problem?

47
00:02:25,464 --> 00:02:27,725
Every time he makes a move
something screws up.

48
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,697
Their last date
they were on the couch...

49
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:32,167
but she was on his wrong side.
- Wrong side?

50
00:02:32,238 --> 00:02:35,797
Yeah, she was on his right side. He
can't make a move with his left hand.

51
00:02:35,876 --> 00:02:37,273
Can't go left.

52
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:39,642
- He can't go left?
- No.

53
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:42,475
I'm lefty. Can't go right.

54
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,779
What about women?
They go left or right?

55
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:47,250
No, we just play defense.

56
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:11,539
Could I ask you a question?

57
00:03:12,649 --> 00:03:14,842
Would you mind switching seats?

58
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:23,282
Actually, I'd really prefer to sit here.
I don't hear very well out of this ear.

59
00:03:24,327 --> 00:03:28,023
I always try to sit
to the right of people.

60
00:03:28,899 --> 00:03:30,899
I'll shout.

61
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,704
Well, I really think
I feel more comfortable here.

62
00:03:34,772 --> 00:03:36,635
Come on, come on.

63
00:03:36,707 --> 00:03:38,502
- Come on, really. Come on.
- George, I...

64
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,941
- Now, come on.
- No, I really...

65
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:50,215
See, now is that so bad?

66
00:03:50,288 --> 00:03:51,878
What?

67
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,217
- Oh, I...
- The machine will get it.

68
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,622
No, it's not on.

69
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:59,560
- They'll call back.
- George, what if it's an emergency?

70
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:02,428
In the whole world right now
there's maybe three emergencies.

71
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:05,538
Why would you think on this
planet that you're one of those three?

72
00:04:05,606 --> 00:04:08,402
George, please.

73
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:12,641
Hello.

74
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,208
What?

75
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,713
Oh, my God.

76
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:20,354
All right, maybe four.

77
00:04:22,824 --> 00:04:25,188
Boy, I'm really sweating.

78
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,921
Good sweat. Beads of sweat.
Sweating bullets.

79
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,920
Look at her.

80
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,933
I don't need to see her naked
to know those aren't real.

81
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:36,435
I mean, why'd she even
tie the towel around her?

82
00:04:36,505 --> 00:04:39,199
She's got a rack on her chest.

83
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,944
Oh, God.
Sidra's taking the towel off.

84
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:49,312
Doctor.

85
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:50,714
That's it.

86
00:04:50,787 --> 00:04:53,481
I knew it. I knew it.
They're definitely fake.

87
00:04:53,557 --> 00:04:55,921
So when's the funeral?

88
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,592
Oh, well.

89
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:04,065
Aunt Clarice was so ill
I guess it was really a blessing.

90
00:05:12,544 --> 00:05:15,613
Yeah, I'll fly home
as soon as I can.

91
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,888
Okay. You too. Get some sleep.

92
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,756
- You're sure?
- Positive.

93
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,733
This chick's playing
with Confederate money.

94
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,668
Then that's it.
That's the end of that.

95
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,035
- What? Just because that?
- Just because of that?

96
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:45,406
It's like finding out
Mickey Mantle corked his bat.

97
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,041
You've dated women with nose jobs.
What's the difference?

98
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:55,155
You don't touch the nose.
You don't aspire to reach the nose.

99
00:05:55,223 --> 00:05:57,518
You don't unhook anything
to get to a nose...

100
00:05:57,592 --> 00:06:01,355
and no man has ever tried to look
up a woman's nostrils.

101
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,797
You've put a lot of thought into this,
haven't you?

102
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,334
Well, I take it very seriously.

103
00:06:09,305 --> 00:06:13,808
Sometimes when I think you're
the shallowest man I've ever met...

104
00:06:13,876 --> 00:06:17,469
you somehow manage
to drain a little more out of the pool.

105
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:21,280
- Hey.
- Hey.

106
00:06:22,786 --> 00:06:24,183
- Hey.
- Hey.

107
00:06:24,254 --> 00:06:27,016
You know, I do kind of wonder
what fake breasts feel like.

108
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,158
Well, I know what they feel like.

109
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:30,555
You? How do you know?

110
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:33,492
Well, I lived in Los Angeles
for three months.

111
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:36,657
- I thought you hated Los Angeles.
- No, I do.

112
00:06:36,734 --> 00:06:39,394
Just miss
the warm weather, you know?

113
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,796
Oh, man, I wish I could get away.

114
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:44,408
Real busy now, down at the office?

115
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,372
No. You know who I saw
at the health club?

116
00:06:47,446 --> 00:06:49,537
Salman Rushdie.

117
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:52,411
- No.
- Yeah, right.

118
00:06:52,484 --> 00:06:53,915
Salman Rushdie.

119
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:56,885
Well, I could see that. You got
five million Moslems after you.

120
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,218
You wanna stay
in pretty good shape.

121
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:01,621
I know what the problem is.

122
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:04,888
I like her too much.
That's why I can't make a move.

123
00:07:04,965 --> 00:07:09,126
- You put her on a pedestal.
- I put them on a dental chair.

124
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,902
He puts them on a dental chair.

125
00:07:12,006 --> 00:07:15,473
I'm not her boyfriend.
I wanna be her boyfriend.

126
00:07:17,244 --> 00:07:19,812
It's like a sauna in here.

127
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,444
- That's funny.
- You're a funny guy.

128
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,521
Never heard that before.

129
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:30,852
So you going to the funeral?

130
00:07:30,926 --> 00:07:32,687
- You think I should?
- Are you kidding?

131
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:35,261
It's a golden opportunity
to advance the relationship.

132
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,991
She's crying. You put your arm
around her and console her.

133
00:07:38,067 --> 00:07:39,930
You're the consolation guy.

134
00:07:40,003 --> 00:07:44,563
- I'm the consolation guy.
- Consolation guy is big.

135
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:47,299
Her aunt dying
is the best thing for you.

136
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:50,072
It's like 10 dates in one shot.

137
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,080
This confers upon you
instant boyfriend status.

138
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:55,775
The family's there.

139
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:59,946
You're taking care of things. You're
getting sandwiches. You're the rock.

140
00:08:00,024 --> 00:08:02,525
It's in Detroit, though.
It's an expensive flight.

141
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:05,788
Why don't you get a
"death in the family" fare?

142
00:08:05,864 --> 00:08:07,522
What?

143
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:12,193
Go to the airlines. Tell them
that you have a death in the family...

144
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,736
they give you
50 percent off the fare.

145
00:08:14,806 --> 00:08:16,169
- Really?
- In fact...

146
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:19,641
listen, I'll go with you. We'll tell
them there's a death in my family.

147
00:08:19,712 --> 00:08:21,939
You buy the ticket. I'll split it.

148
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:26,346
Then I'll get the bonus miles and you'll
get to Detroit for a quarter of the price.

149
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,817
Boy, I'm getting a good sweat here.
Great sweat. Good beads. Nice beads.

150
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:39,062
Oh, look who's here.
Silicon Valley.

151
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,033
Oh, so anyway. We go out on one date,
and he asks me out for a second...

152
00:08:44,105 --> 00:08:46,799
and then out of nowhere he calls me,
cancels the date...

153
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,465
and says
he doesn't wanna see me again.

154
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:53,206
Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing.

155
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:56,146
- Oh, that's okay.
- Did he give you a reason?

156
00:08:56,218 --> 00:08:59,253
Yeah. He's going back
to his old girlfriend.

157
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:01,083
Really?

158
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:03,190
Said she's mentally ill.

159
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:09,632
He's one of those guys who is
obsessed with neatness and order.

160
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:14,259
Everything has gotta be just so.
He would have made a great Nazi.

161
00:09:18,274 --> 00:09:20,342
Hey, does he ever
talk about Superman?

162
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,845
- Yes. How did you know?
- I know the type.

163
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:27,040
- Oh, so you can relate?
- Oh, yeah.

164
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:31,052
You know, I've seen you around the
club. My name's Sidra. This is Marcy.

165
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:33,850
- Oh, hi. I'm Elaine.
- Hi.

166
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:43,890
Anyway, I stood up to shake her hand
and suddenly I lost my balance...

167
00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:46,970
and I fell right into her.
- You fell on her?

168
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,964
I touched them.

169
00:09:50,676 --> 00:09:52,038
You what?

170
00:09:52,645 --> 00:09:55,908
I touched them.

171
00:09:55,982 --> 00:09:57,310
You touched them?

172
00:09:57,383 --> 00:10:00,350
I needed them to help me
break my fall.

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,284
If it hadn't been for them,
I could have really injured myself.

174
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:08,216
Anyway...

175
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,290
they're real.

176
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:13,995
Excuse me.

177
00:10:14,836 --> 00:10:16,801
I think they might be real.

178
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,168
Oh, what do you know? You have
no breast-touching experience.

179
00:10:20,241 --> 00:10:23,674
- I've touched mine.
- So have I.

180
00:10:24,445 --> 00:10:26,911
Oh, right, I forgot.

181
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:33,013
Anyway, touching two breasts
doesn't make you an expert.

182
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:40,025
All right. Anyway, I think they're real,
and if they are, they are spectacular.

183
00:10:41,698 --> 00:10:44,528
What are you doing to me?

184
00:10:48,171 --> 00:10:49,568
You see...

185
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:52,708
my friend here,
his aunt passed away last...

186
00:10:52,776 --> 00:10:54,435
Oh, I'm very sorry.

187
00:10:54,512 --> 00:11:00,016
I saw her last week. She looked
healthy and peaceful but she knew.

188
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,311
You poor thing.

189
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:06,512
You don't think you could buy
the ticket yourself? Oh, no, okay.

190
00:11:06,591 --> 00:11:10,685
- I couldn't...
- No, please. There, there. You sit.

191
00:11:10,762 --> 00:11:13,194
I'll purchase the ticket for you.

192
00:11:13,265 --> 00:11:14,730
You're a good friend.

193
00:11:15,234 --> 00:11:19,293
I understand you offer a
50-percent-off bereavement fare?

194
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:24,239
Yes. You have to pay the full fare now
then return to one of our counters...

195
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,608
with a copy of the death certificate,
and we'll refund half your fare.

196
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:33,052
The death certificate?

197
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,418
Yes, we do need documentation
or people could take advantage.

198
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:41,755
What kind of a sick person
would do a thing like that?

199
00:11:41,829 --> 00:11:43,658
I know but it happens.

200
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:49,236
You want my friend to ask his uncle,
a man who lost his wife of 44 years...

201
00:11:49,304 --> 00:11:52,271
for a death certificate to
save a few bucks on a flight?

202
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:55,568
That would be $387 round trip.

203
00:11:55,644 --> 00:11:59,145
- You'll need my frequent flyer number.
- Yes.

204
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,080
I don't know.
One minute they're fake...

205
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:06,687
the next they're real.
I don't know what to believe.

206
00:12:06,756 --> 00:12:10,690
Hey, of the two of us, I'm the only
one who's touched them.

207
00:12:12,696 --> 00:12:15,094
Well, you were grabbing
onto them to save your life.

208
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:17,310
If you were drowning and
I threw you a life preserver...

209
00:12:17,334 --> 00:12:19,868
you think you could tell
me if it was an inflatable?

210
00:12:19,937 --> 00:12:22,528
I wouldn't have said anything if
I'd known you'd stop seeing her.

211
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:26,768
I don't mind a phony personality
but I gotta draw the line somewhere.

212
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:29,938
- Hey.
- Hey.

213
00:12:30,014 --> 00:12:32,639
- George off to Detroit?
- Yep. And in two days...

214
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:34,944
I'm off to Puerto Rico.

215
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,281
Hey, Kramer, by the way...

216
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:41,119
I saw that guy at the health club.
That is not Salman Rushdie.

217
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,126
Wrong.

218
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,430
- There's Sidra.
- There's Salman.

219
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,191
- Where?
- Talking to that woman.

220
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,734
- To Sidra?
- If that's Sidra, she's talking to Salman.

221
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,271
- I don't think that's Salman.
- I don't think they're real.

222
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:56,886
- If that's Rushdie, they're real.
- If they're real, that's Rushdie.

223
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:59,910
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Sidra.
- I gotta know. I'm talking to Salman.

224
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,481
Like a sauna in here, huh?

225
00:13:06,821 --> 00:13:10,254
Feel like I'm back at the desert.

226
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:16,687
- You've lived in the desert?
- Oh, yeah. I've...

227
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:19,800
I spent a little time
in the Mideast.

228
00:13:20,936 --> 00:13:23,061
You ever been to the Mideast?

229
00:13:23,138 --> 00:13:27,004
- Yes, I've been there.
- Look, my name's Kramer.

230
00:13:27,476 --> 00:13:28,804
- Sal Bass.
- Yeah.

231
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,945
- Pleased to meet you, Kramer.
- Yeah.

232
00:13:31,446 --> 00:13:33,777
So...

233
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:36,949
what kind of work do you do?

234
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:39,555
I'm a writer.

235
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:46,060
- Have you met my boyfriend, George?
- No.

236
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,199
George, this is Aunt May
and Father Jessup.

237
00:13:49,266 --> 00:13:51,391
Oh, and that's my brother, Timmy.

238
00:13:51,468 --> 00:13:54,230
This is my boyfriend, George.

239
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:57,066
Oh, George, how nice of you
to come all this way.

240
00:13:57,141 --> 00:14:02,407
Well, I'm the boyfriend. Otherwise,
what's the point of being the boyfriend.

241
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,141
This is where you have to be
when you're the boyfriend.

242
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:09,311
Betsy, dear,
have you had anything to eat?

243
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:12,787
- I'm not very hungry.
- They have some very nice snacks.

244
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:15,984
I'm about to get myself a snack.

245
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,687
Oh, no. You sit right here.

246
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:21,628
I will get you a nice snack.

247
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,107
This is my...

248
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:30,970
third wake this month.

249
00:14:31,044 --> 00:14:32,771
Never gets any easier.

250
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:36,279
Well, losing a loved one is...

251
00:14:36,349 --> 00:14:38,680
I mean, forget about it.

252
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:49,223
You...

253
00:14:49,997 --> 00:14:53,033
You seem to be of great comfort
to Betsy. We're very appreciative.

254
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,261
Comfort "schmomfort."

255
00:14:56,905 --> 00:15:01,374
Listen, Father,
can I ask you a question?

256
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:04,372
In a terrible time like this...

257
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,710
who would I get the
death certificate from?

258
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:12,454
- Oh, Jerry.
- Oh, how can you be so sure?

259
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:17,754
Jerry, are you blind? He's a writer.
He said his name was Sal Bass.

260
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,225
Bass, Jerry.

261
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:22,490
Instead of salmon,
he went with bass.

262
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:25,760
He just substituted
one fish for another.

263
00:15:26,303 --> 00:15:30,567
Look, you idiot, first of all,
it's "Salman," not "salmon."

264
00:15:30,642 --> 00:15:33,472
Jerry, Jerry, you're missing
the big picture.

265
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:36,113
All right. Maybe it is,
but listen, I gotta get ready...

266
00:15:36,181 --> 00:15:38,340
Sidra's coming over
so if you don't mind...

267
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:42,008
- What, did you ask her?
- I'm gonna find out tonight.

268
00:15:42,087 --> 00:15:44,088
Yes.

269
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,358
Why do you need
a death certificate?

270
00:15:49,896 --> 00:15:52,487
Well, Dr. Allenwood...

271
00:15:52,832 --> 00:15:55,924
I was hoping to compile an...

272
00:15:56,002 --> 00:16:01,473
admittedly rudimentary
scrapbook of her life.

273
00:16:02,142 --> 00:16:05,541
Something that Betsy
could have and hold on to.

274
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:08,340
Well, I suppose I could
make a copy of it.

275
00:16:08,415 --> 00:16:10,039
Oh, that would be wonderful.

276
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,053
- Well, it's nice meeting you, George.
- Likewise.

277
00:16:29,004 --> 00:16:30,731
What are you doing?

278
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,172
- What?
- Did..?

279
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,402
Did you just double dip that chip?

280
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,345
- Excuse me?
- You double dipped the chip.

281
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,848
Double dipped?
What are you talking about?

282
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:45,351
You dipped the chip.
You took a bite...

283
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:47,649
and you dipped again.

284
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:52,060
- So?
- It's like putting your whole mouth...

285
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,254
right in the dip.

286
00:16:55,433 --> 00:17:01,199
From now on, when you take a chip
just take one dip and end it.

287
00:17:04,376 --> 00:17:07,707
Well, I'm sorry, Timmy...

288
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,904
but I don't dip that way.

289
00:17:09,982 --> 00:17:11,879
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.

290
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,883
You dip the way you wanna dip...

291
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:16,783
I'll dip the way I wanna dip.

292
00:17:16,856 --> 00:17:18,514
- Give me the chip.
- Hey, hey, hey!

293
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,919
Give me the chip.

294
00:17:21,027 --> 00:17:24,619
I don't know what I'm doing here.
I must be crazy.

295
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:40,041
- Hey, you mind switching seats?
- Why?

296
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:44,413
I don't know. I like sitting to the left of
people. Makes me feel like I'm driving.

297
00:17:45,253 --> 00:17:47,719
Okay.

298
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,689
- How you doing?
- Good.

299
00:17:56,766 --> 00:17:58,766
- How you doing?
- Good.

300
00:17:58,834 --> 00:18:00,902
Feel good.

301
00:18:02,638 --> 00:18:05,263
You know that Jayne Mansfield
had some big breasts.

302
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:11,775
Really big...

303
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:15,111
Huge. Just coming out the top of
her dress. They were choking her.

304
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,580
- I hear that's how she died.
- Yeah.

305
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,426
Have you noticed
that women today are..?

306
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,528
You know, they seem bigger.

307
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:28,190
- A lot of women are having them done.
- Really?

308
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:30,766
- Yeah.
- How do you like that?

309
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:33,665
A lot of people ask me
if I've had mine done.

310
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,239
You know people.

311
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:38,840
Gets a little tiring.
It's none of their business.

312
00:18:38,911 --> 00:18:41,536
Oh, the nerve.

313
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:45,713
You know some people have
asked me if you've done that.

314
00:18:46,218 --> 00:18:47,649
And what do you tell them?

315
00:18:48,288 --> 00:18:50,879
Whatever you want me
to tell them.

316
00:18:51,524 --> 00:18:54,889
Well, I think
you'll find out soon enough.

317
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,034
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- No.

318
00:19:04,105 --> 00:19:07,038
- Well, what if it's an emergency?
- Oh, there's no emergency.

319
00:19:07,108 --> 00:19:10,541
Jerry. Come on.
It's an emergency.

320
00:19:12,413 --> 00:19:14,310
Excuse me.

321
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,179
All right.

322
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:18,979
What is it? You're interrupting.

323
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:23,523
I'm packing for Puerto Rico.
I need to borrow your bathing suit.

324
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:26,255
This is an emergency?
You need a bathing suit?

325
00:19:26,328 --> 00:19:27,690
Well, I like yours.

326
00:19:29,031 --> 00:19:32,897
I don't know, my bathing suit?
That's a little familiar.

327
00:19:32,969 --> 00:19:36,470
I don't want your boys down there.

328
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:44,240
What's the matter with my boys?

329
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:48,009
Your boys should stay
in their neighborhood.

330
00:19:49,453 --> 00:19:52,852
- All right, come on.
- All right. It's in the top drawer.

331
00:19:52,923 --> 00:19:55,254
- Hurry up.
- Hey.

332
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,256
- Hi, Jer.
- Hi, Elaine.

333
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:02,024
- Oh, hi, Sidra.
- Hi. Elaine?

334
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,896
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Kramer.

335
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:09,785
- What's going on?
- She was just...

336
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,275
showing me pictures
of places in Puerto Rico.

337
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:14,935
- When you two went down there.
- Oh, yeah. All right.

338
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,309
- Well, just...
- You know, these...

339
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,882
- Yeah, yeah.
- All right.

340
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:25,188
So where were we?

341
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:28,589
- I was just leaving.
- Right. You were leaving.

342
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,595
I can't believe you sent a woman
into the sauna to do that?

343
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,562
That was an accident.

344
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,726
I think you're both mentally ill.

345
00:20:43,911 --> 00:20:49,279
And by the way, they're real
and they're spectacular.

346
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:54,044
Stop it, George. Get out. Get out!
I never wanna see you again.

347
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,191
- Go back to New York.
- Get out.

348
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:04,190
All right, sir. Now all I need is a death
certificate and you'll be on your way.

349
00:21:04,767 --> 00:21:07,995
Well, you see
what happened was...

350
00:21:08,638 --> 00:21:14,735
the doctor, the very same doctor that
was attending my late aunt suffered...

351
00:21:14,812 --> 00:21:17,142
an untimely stroke...

352
00:21:17,214 --> 00:21:20,977
and lost the use
of his right hand so...

353
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:24,848
obviously I was unable to get
the death certificate.

354
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:28,015
However, I do have this.

355
00:21:29,094 --> 00:21:32,061
What's this?
- A picture of me next to the coffin.

356
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:35,394
- Nice try.
- Not even close, huh?

357
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:37,034
No.

358
00:21:41,274 --> 00:21:44,571
The cosmetic surgery procedures
that are available to people today...

359
00:21:44,644 --> 00:21:46,575
Liposuction.
Are you familiar with this?

360
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:48,839
This is a fat-sucking machine.

361
00:21:48,915 --> 00:21:51,745
Now, you know, somewhere,
somebody is working on a way...

362
00:21:51,817 --> 00:21:54,284
that this thing could go
into a restaurant.

363
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:56,684
And you could just
order it off the menu.

364
00:21:56,757 --> 00:21:58,916
Give me the cheesecake,
crank me up to nine...

365
00:21:58,992 --> 00:22:01,356
and put a scoop of ice cream
on the side.

366
00:22:02,305 --> 00:22:08,703
