Look at this.
533.139
# BOB
533.139
It's an antique.
534.541
# RAY
534.614
It's all handmade,
and I love the inlay.
537.419
# BOB
537.492
Yes, yes. Me too.
539.170
538.300
**LOL**
540.286
It's gorgeous, completely. Pick it up.
542.758
543.081
Pick it up from the bottom.
544.334
# KRAMER
544.334
Wait, what are you doing?
545.588
# BOB
545.667
What does it look like we're doing?
We're taking this.
548.257
# KRAMER
548.544
You can't take this.
This belongs to a friend of mine.
551.052
# BOB
551.130
Look, you wanna get hurt?
552.890
# KRAMER
# BOB
553.216
I don't think you wanna get hurt.
If you wanna get hurt, I can hurt you.
556.601
556.677
Now, just back off.

557.700

562.141
You have some kind of problem?
What is it you're not understanding?
565.242
562.800
**LOL**
565.311
We're taking the armoire,
and that's all there is to it.
567.866

Okay?

**LOL**
# ELAINE
579.449
I mean, is he allowed to do this?
581.008
581.076
It's discrimination.
582.551
582.619
I'm gonna call the state's

# GEORGE
584.788
This is fabulous, my God.

**LOL**
# ELAINE
587.499
All right, all right.
Give me a taste.
589.307
594.255
Oh, my God. I've gotta sit down.
595.782
595.782
Yeah.
597.309

**LOL**
603.181
What happened?
Where's my armoire?
605.736
# KRAMER
606.392
It was stolen.
607.338
# ELAINE
607.338
What?
608.283

**LOL**
# KRAMER
608.352
These street toughs,
they robbed me.
610.160
# ELAINE
611.021
Street toughs took my armoire?
613.494
# KRAMER
613.566
Yeah, it was very frightening.
616.038
616.200
**LOL**
616.110
My life was in danger.
617.585
617.653
You should've seen
the way they talked to me.
619.745

**LOL**
# ELAINE
620.364
I can't believe this!
621.659
# KRAMER
621.659
So where's the soup?
622.955
# ELAINE
623.242
The Soup Nazi threw me out.
625.251
# KRAMER
626.078
Yeah!
628.170
629.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
630.957
What are you gonna get?
632.360
# SHEILA
632.360
I'll decide at the last minute.
633.762
# JERRY
633.877
You better decide, sister.
You're on deck.
635.804
# JERRY
636.671
Sheila!
638.396
# SOUPNAZI
640.216
What is this?
You're kissing in my line?
642.309
642.900
**LOL**
642.385
Nobody kisses in my line.
644.027
# SHEILA
644.846
I can kiss anywhere I want to.
646.746
# SOUPNAZI
646.746
You just cost yourself a soup.
648.646
649.500
**LOL**
# SHEILA
649.225
How dare you?
650.523
650.601
Come on, Jerry, we're leaving.
653.192

Jerry?

Do I know you?
665.997
665.600
**LOL**
670.700
**LOL**
# ELAINE
671.789
So essentially,
you chose soup over a woman?
675.886
# JERRY
676.627
It was a bisque.
678.766
678.600
**LOL**
# ELAINE
679.963
Yeah, you know what
I've just realized?
681.972
682.049
Suddenly, George has become
much more normal than you.
685.731
# JERRY
685.802
Really?
686.932
686.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
686.932
Yeah. Well, I mean, think about it.
688.061
688.138
He's engaged to be married.
690.065
690.140
Your top priority is soup.
692.565
693.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
692.642
Have you tasted the soup?
694.320
# ELAINE
695.019
Yeah, all right.
You made the right decision.
697.527
697.700
**LOL**
# JERRY
698.356
See, it's much easier
to patch things up with Sheila...
701.326
701.401
than with the Soup Nazi.
703.078
703.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
704.237
Hey.
705.265
# KRAMER
# ELAINE
705.265
Hey.
706.294
# KRAMER
# JERRY
706.364
Oh, thanks.
707.285
# ELAINE
707.285
There he is.
708.207
# KRAMER
708.282
Elaine, I'm really sorry
about the armoire.
711.253
# ELAINE
711.327
Yeah, I know. Me too.
712.506
# JERRY
712.578
So did these thieves want any money?
714.087
# KRAMER
714.087
No.
715.595
# JERRY
715.664
They just wanted the armoire?
717.215
# KRAMER
717.215
Yeah, they were quite taken with it.
718.765
719.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
720.419
Yeah.
722.097
# GEORGE
# JERRY
723.672
Have you noticed
George is acting a little strange lately?
726.441
# ELAINE
726.508
No. In what way?
727.889
# JERRY
727.968
I don't know. A lot of attitude,
like he's better than me.
731.188
# ELAINE
731.263
I don't think George has ever thought
he's better than anybody.
734.280
734.200
**LOL**

Were you just talking about me?
What's going on?

741.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
743.358
Absolutely not.
744.786
# GEORGE
745.693
Something's going on here.
746.597
# KRAMER
746.597
All right.
747.501
747.570
I'm gonna go get some soup.
749.081
# ELAINE
749.155
One of these days,
that guy is gonna get his.
751.627
# GEORGE
751.699
So how was the movie?
753.459
753.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
753.534
We didn't go.
Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.
756.386
# GEORGE
756.829
Oh, yeah?
758.637
# JERRY
759.624
Yeah.
760.969
762.877
What, are you happy?
764.685
763.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
765.337
Happy? Why should I be happy?
766.674
# JERRY
766.674
I don't know.
768.011
767.400
**LOL**
768.090
But you look like you're happy.
770.147
# GEORGE
770.217
Why should I care?
771.692
# JERRY
771.802
You can't fool me.
773.182
773.262
Don't insult me,
because I know when you're happy.
775.650
776.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
776.598
All right, I am happy.
And I'll tell you why.
779.154
779.226
The two of you were making me
and every one of your friends sick.
782.611
782.688
Right, Elaine?
784.864
785.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
788.401
Is that so?
789.746
# GEORGE
789.820
Yeah. With all that kissing and the
"Schmoopie, Schmoopie, Schmoopie."
793.538
793.900
**LOL**
793.615
Out in public like that. It's disgusting.
794.934
# JERRY
794.934
Disgusting?
796.253
# GEORGE
796.326
People who do that
should be arrested.
798.751
799.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
798.912
I guess I have all the more reason
to get back with her.
801.503
# GEORGE
801.581
And we had a pact, you know.
804.516
804.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
805.918
What?
807.214
# GEORGE
807.214
You shook my hand.
808.509
# JERRY
808.588
You're still with the pact?
810.182
# GEORGE
810.256
You reneged.
811.534
# JERRY
811.534
All I did was shake your hand.
812.811
815.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
# KRAMER
818.055
And then they just ran off
with the armoire, just like that.

This city.

So continue.
835.828
# KRAMER
835.828
My friend is awfully disappointed.
837.752
837.824
You know, she's very emotional.
839.917
# NEWMAN
840.619
Thank you.
842.343
843.700
**LOL**
847.959
Jambalaya.
850.265
850.400
**LOL**
# SOUPNAZI
851.254
All right, now listen to me.
You have been a good friend.
853.892
853.965
I have an armoire in my basement.
855.559
855.633
If you want to pick it up,
you're welcome to it.
858.022
858.094
So take it, it's yours.
860.233
# KRAMER
860.304
How can I possibly thank you?
862.231
# SOUPNAZI
862.306
You are the only one
who understands me.
864.233
# KRAMER
864.308
You suffer for your soup.
865.693
# SOUPNAZI
865.693
Yes, that is right.
867.078
# KRAMER
867.144
You demand perfection
from yourself, from your soup.
870.245
867.800
**LOL**
# SOUPNAZI
870.314
How can I tolerate any less
from my customers?
872.703

**LOL**
# CUSTOMER
873.442
Gazpacho, por favor.
875.202
# SOUPNAZI
875.444
"Por favor"?
877.178

**LOL**
# CUSTOMER
877.178
Oh, I'm part Spanish.
878.913
# SOUPNAZI
879.323
Adios, muchacho.
881.000
881.800
**LOL**
# KRAMER
882.034
You heard him. Get out.
884.589
# JERRY
887.372
It was stupid of me.
888.931
# SHEILA
888.999
Well, it was very insulting.
890.427
# JERRY
890.500
No, I know.
I was really sort of half kidding.
892.759
# SHEILA
893.211
Well, behind every joke
there's some truth.
896.063
896.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
896.214
Well, what about that
Bavarian cream pie joke?
898.437
898.508
There's no truth to that.
899.888
899.968
Nobody with a terminal illness
goes to Europe...
902.191
902.262
for a piece of Bavarian cream pie...
904.105
904.180
and then when they don't have it,
he says, "I'll just have some coffee."
907.863
908.400
**LOL**
907.976
There's no truth to that.
909.959
# SHEILA
909.959
Well, I guess you're right.
911.943
# JERRY
912.313
So am I forgiven, Schmoopie?
914.196
# SHEILA
914.196
Yes, Schmoopie.

So...
932.594
932.666
you sit on the same side
in a booth?
934.640
# JERRY
934.710
Yeah, that's right.
You got a problem?
936.933
# GEORGE
938.130
I just think it's a little unusual
for two people to sit on one side...
942.975
943.051
and leave the other side empty.
945.144
# JERRY
945.220
Well, we're changing the rules.
947.312

947.389
Well, good for you.

951.612

953.061
I don't know, honey.
What do you wanna get?
956.494
956.564
I want you to get anything you want.
959.831

What about you, Schmoopie?
How about a little tuna?

You want a little tuna fishy?

1010.241
I'll tell you where I got it.

Get out!

a little bit misunderstood, but....
1031.397

I'm gonna go down there

expressing your feelings

You? If I knew it was for you,
I never would have given it to him!
1092.878

1193.140
1193.210
I could give these
to every restaurant in town.
1195.552
1195.629
I could have them published.
1197.057
1197.130
I could drop fliers
from a plane above the city.
