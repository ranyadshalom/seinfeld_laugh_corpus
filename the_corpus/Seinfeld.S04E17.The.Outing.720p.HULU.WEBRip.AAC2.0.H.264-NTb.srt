1
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:07,724
I'm tired of pretending I'm excited
every time it's somebody's birthday.

2
00:00:07,889 --> 00:00:10,483
What is the big deal?
How many times do we have to...

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:12,765
...celebrate that someone was born?

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,399
Every year, over and over.
All you did was not die for 12 months.

5
00:00:16,569 --> 00:00:19,208
That's all you've done,
as far as I could tell.

6
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,678
I love the astrology things
that tell you the people...

7
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:23,487
...that have the same birthday
as you.

8
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,367
It's always an odd group of people.

9
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:28,202
It's like Ed Asner,
Elijah Muhammed and Secretariat.

10
00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:35,600
I don't wanna live.

11
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:38,237
I don't wanna live!

12
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,000
Because of me?

13
00:00:41,169 --> 00:00:44,206
You must be joking. Who wouldn't
wanna live because of me?

14
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:46,599
- I'm nothing.
- No.

15
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,727
- You're something.
- You can do better than me.

16
00:00:49,889 --> 00:00:52,847
You could throw a dart out the window
and hit someone better.

17
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,283
I'm no good.

18
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,599
You're good. You're good.

19
00:00:56,769 --> 00:00:58,248
I'm bad. I'm bad.

20
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:00,127
You're killing me!

21
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,962
So what could I do?
I couldn't go through with it.

22
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,642
She threatened to kill herself.

23
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:06,527
Over you?

24
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:10,079
Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?

25
00:01:11,449 --> 00:01:13,167
- Well-
- I'm trying to get in touch...

26
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:15,604
...with Sharon Leonard.
She works for the NYU paper.

27
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:18,886
This is Jerry Seinfeld. She was
supposed to meet me for an interview.

28
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:21,438
Oh, what are you gonna get
Jerry for his birthday?

29
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:23,565
- I got him a great gift.
- Really? What?

30
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:25,526
I got two tickets
to see Guys and Dols.

31
00:01:25,689 --> 00:01:28,203
Oh, that is a good gift.

32
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:29,643
Maybe he'll take me.

33
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:33,128
No, I'm gonna go with him.

34
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,563
What did you get him?

35
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,121
- I got him a two-line phone.
- Really? That's good.

36
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:40,280
Unbelievable. She's not there.

37
00:01:40,449 --> 00:01:43,521
- What paper does she write for?
- For the NYU school newspaper.

38
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:46,601
She's a grad student in journalism.
Never been to a comedy club.

39
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:48,361
Never seen me.
Has no idea who I am.

40
00:01:48,529 --> 00:01:50,440
Never even seen you?

41
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:52,201
Gotta kind of envy that.

42
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:56,846
You know, you've been developing
quite the acid tongue lately.

43
00:01:57,769 --> 00:01:59,327
Really?

44
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:03,164
Who do you think is
the most unattractive world leader?

45
00:02:03,449 --> 00:02:05,326
- Living or all-time?
- All-time.

46
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:08,526
If it's all-time, there's no contest.
It begins and ends with Brezhnev.

47
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,403
I don't know. Did you ever
get a good look at De Gaulle?

48
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,568
Lyndon Johnson
was uglier than De Gaulle.

49
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,966
I got news for you. Golda Meir
could make them all run up a tree.

50
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:21,606
Golda Meir. Good one, babe.

51
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:25,483
Hey, come here. Come here.

52
00:02:25,649 --> 00:02:28,561
Those two girls behind you,
they're eavesdropping.

53
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:32,720
- Really?
- You know just because you two...

54
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:34,447
...are homosexuals, so what?

55
00:02:36,529 --> 00:02:41,319
I mean, you should come out of
the closet and be openly gay already.

56
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:45,246
So, what do you say?

57
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:50,206
You know you'll always
be the only man I'll ever love.

58
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:51,962
What's the matter with you?

59
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:55,405
- Come on. Go along.
- I'm not going along.

60
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,527
I could just see you in Berlin
in 1939 goose-stepping past me.

61
00:02:58,689 --> 00:03:01,567
"Come on, Jerry.
Go along. Go along."

62
00:03:01,809 --> 00:03:04,198
- You're no fun.
- You know, I hear that all the time.

63
00:03:04,369 --> 00:03:06,564
- Hear what?
- That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.

64
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:08,367
People ask me that about you too.

65
00:03:08,529 --> 00:03:12,044
Yeah, because I'm single,
I'm thin, and I'm neat.

66
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,241
And you get along well with women.

67
00:03:15,409 --> 00:03:17,877
I guess that leaves me in the clear.

68
00:03:20,289 --> 00:03:22,564
Hi, Jerry, it's Sharon Leonard
from the NYU paper.

69
00:03:22,729 --> 00:03:25,118
I'm here at the coffee shop,
and I was a little late.

70
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:26,688
We must have missed
each other.

71
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:28,521
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Me too.

72
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:32,602
I'll be here for a little while longer,
and I'll try to hook up with you later.

73
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:42,482
- Hey.
- Hey.

74
00:03:42,649 --> 00:03:47,006
I just thought of a great name for
myself, if I ever become a porno actor.

75
00:03:48,369 --> 00:03:51,406
Oh, yeah? What? Buck Naked?

76
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:54,926
Yeah. How did you know that?

77
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,963
You told me that already.
Like two months ago.

78
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:00,360
Let me ask you something.

79
00:04:00,889 --> 00:04:02,720
What do you think of this shirt?

80
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:05,560
Well...

81
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,518
Allison bought it for me.

82
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,003
- How you gonna get out of that one?
- I don't know.

83
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:16,842
I guess I have to wait for her to die.

84
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:21,602
- Yeah?
- Sharon from NYU.

85
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,043
Come on up.

86
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,928
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's that reporter from NYU.

87
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,319
She's doing the interview.
I told her to come here...

88
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,808
...so we won't miss each other.

89
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:32,483
- Do you want me to stay or...?
- Sure, I don't care.

90
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:38,446
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm- I'm Sharon.

91
00:04:38,609 --> 00:04:40,440
Hi, I'm Jerry.

92
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:43,967
- Something the matter?
- No, no. Nothing.

93
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:47,405
- You look familiar. Have we ever met?
- I'm not sure. Have we?

94
00:04:47,969 --> 00:04:49,607
You look familiar.

95
00:04:49,769 --> 00:04:52,044
Why don't we do this over here?
This is George.

96
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,359
Oh, hi. Nice to meet you.

97
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:57,601
- He'll hang around, if that's okay.
- Sure, I'd like to talk to him.

98
00:04:57,769 --> 00:04:59,805
Oh, really?

99
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:02,441
- Okay.
- Okay.

100
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,088
There we go.

101
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:08,922
- Oh, is that a problem?
- No, I just hate my voice on tape.

102
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,728
It always sounds so high and whiny.

103
00:05:12,609 --> 00:05:14,122
- Well, shall we start?
- Fire away.

104
00:05:14,289 --> 00:05:19,204
Okay, let's see. Are you just a
comedian, or do you do anything else?

105
00:05:19,369 --> 00:05:22,122
Well, right now George
and I are writing a pilot for NBC.

106
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,881
Oh, so you also work together.

107
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:26,282
Yeah.

108
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,480
Jerry, did you wash this pear?

109
00:05:30,209 --> 00:05:33,997
- Yeah, I washed it.
- It looks like it hasn't been washed.

110
00:05:34,249 --> 00:05:36,399
So wash it.

111
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:39,963
You hear the way he talks to me?

112
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,603
You should hear
how my boyfriend talks to me.

113
00:05:47,929 --> 00:05:49,203
What?

114
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,317
Hey, let me ask you something.

115
00:05:52,489 --> 00:05:53,968
What do you think of this shirt?

116
00:05:54,369 --> 00:05:55,643
It's nice.

117
00:05:56,369 --> 00:05:58,929
Jerry said he didn't like it.

118
00:05:59,089 --> 00:06:01,159
I didn't say I didn't like it.
I said it was okay.

119
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:04,446
- You said you didn't like it.
- Oh, well, so what if I don't like it?

120
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:06,918
Is that, like, the end
of the world or something?

121
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,841
So how did you two meet?

122
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, actually, we met
in a gym locker room.

123
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:12,602
Yeah.

124
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,761
Actually, it was in gym class.
I was trying to climb the ropes...

125
00:06:15,929 --> 00:06:17,965
...and Jerry was spotting me.

126
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:22,048
And I kept slipping
and burning my thighs.

127
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:25,087
And then finally I slipped,
and I fell on Jerry's head.

128
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:29,558
We've been close ever since.

129
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:31,003
Do you guys live together?

130
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,725
- Live together?
- No, I got my own place.

131
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:36,119
Oh, and do your parents know?

132
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:38,845
- Know what?
- My parents?

133
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:40,920
They don't know what's going on.

134
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,522
You're that girl in the coffee shop
that was eavesdropping.

135
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:46,963
I knew you looked familiar.

136
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,528
Oh, no! No!

137
00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:51,728
- I better get going.
- There's been a big misunderstanding.

138
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:54,358
We did that for you.
We knew you were eavesdropping.

139
00:06:54,529 --> 00:06:57,805
That's why my friend said all that.
It was on purpose. We're not gay.

140
00:06:57,969 --> 00:06:59,721
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

141
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:02,244
- Of course not.
- It's fine, if that's who you are.

142
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:04,320
- Absolutely.
- I mean, I have gay friends.

143
00:07:04,489 --> 00:07:08,038
- My father's gay.
- Look, I know what I heard.

144
00:07:08,209 --> 00:07:10,769
- Heard. It was a joke.
- You wanna have sex right now?

145
00:07:10,929 --> 00:07:13,568
Do you wanna have sex
with me right now? Let's go.

146
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:18,207
Come on! Let's go, baby! Come on!

147
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:23,484
Hey, come on. Let's go.
I thought we were gonna take a steam.

148
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,247
- No, I don't want any steam.
- No. No steam.

149
00:07:27,409 --> 00:07:30,003
Well, I don't wanna
sit there naked all by myself.

150
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,728
The whole thing's your fault.

151
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,569
You want me to talk to her?
I'd be perfectly willing to.

152
00:07:34,769 --> 00:07:36,521
- I don't think so.
- You know me...

153
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:39,647
...I walk into a room,
problem solved.

154
00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:42,362
She says she'll think about it.

155
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:47,047
So what, even if it does come out.
It'll just be in an NYU paper.

156
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,161
Why don't you take your jacket off?

157
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:52,207
- No, I'm okay.
- I'm gonna try her again.

158
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,121
Boy.

159
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:56,968
Happy birthday."Faruba!"

160
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,082
- Today's not my birthday.
- Well, I beg to differ.

161
00:08:01,569 --> 00:08:03,560
Well, I think I know
when my birthday is.

162
00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:06,118
Yeah, well, you'd think so,
but you'd be wrong.

163
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,918
Maybe he's right.
Maybe it is my birthday.

164
00:08:11,929 --> 00:08:13,487
Would you take the jacket off?

165
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:16,447
Leave me alone. Get off
my back about the jacket.

166
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,600
- Oh, look at this. A phone.
- Yeah.

167
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:20,725
A two-line phone.

168
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,567
That's terrific! Thanks a lot.

169
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:26,038
Now when someone's
on the phone, I can make a call.

170
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:28,279
- Yeah.
- Look, Elaine, a two-line phone.

171
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:30,207
Yeah, I see it.

172
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:31,802
I'm gonna get one myself.

173
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:33,408
Where you going?

174
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,480
I gotta go return something.

175
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,601
I got a dial tone.

176
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:40,725
- Okay, this is the maiden call.
- Yeah.

177
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,686
Wait, wait. I wanna get the first call.

178
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:44,840
All right. Go to your house. I'll call you.

179
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:52,121
- Helo.
- Hello.

180
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:54,928
Hey, it's working. This is great.
Thanks a lot.

181
00:08:55,089 --> 00:08:57,808
- Happy birthday.
- Wait, I got a call on the other line.

182
00:08:57,969 --> 00:09:00,688
- Okay, later.
- All right, I'll talk to you later.

183
00:09:00,849 --> 00:09:03,204
- Hello?
- Jerry, it's Sharon from NYU.

184
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:05,166
- Hi.
- I was just caling to tel you...

185
00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:08,082
...I'm not gonna play up that angle
we talk ed about.

186
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,604
Oh, thank you very much.
That's great.

187
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:13,647
Hold on a second.
I got a call on the other line.

188
00:09:13,969 --> 00:09:15,243
- Hello.
- Hey.

189
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,162
How you doing? I got that reporter
from the newspaper...

190
00:09:18,329 --> 00:09:20,923
- ... on the other line.
- So, what did she say?

191
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:23,557
She's not gonna play up
that angle in the story.

192
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,197
She thinks we're heterosexual.
I guess we fooled her.

193
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:28,485
All right, I'll get rid of her. Hold on.

194
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:30,122
Sharon?

195
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:32,201
Hello?

196
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,606
Sharon, are you there?

197
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:38,078
- I'm back.
- You know...

198
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,763
...I could hear you on the other line.

199
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,087
What are you talking about?

200
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:53,480
"Sharon, are you there?"

201
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:56,117
You heard me talking
on the other line? Are you sure?

202
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,928
- Yes, I heard you.
- Maybe she was disconnected.

203
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:01,967
Maybe she wasn't. Maybe she heard
the whole conversation.

204
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:06,486
All right. Let me call Kramer, and see
if you can hear anything. Hold on.

205
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:12,608
- Helo.
- The phone may have a problem.

206
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:14,441
"The phone may have a problem."

207
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:16,122
Oh, no!

208
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:19,649
Kramer, this phone's
a piece of junk. Goodbye.

209
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:21,128
"This phone's a piece of junk."

210
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:23,325
Oh, no! She's heard everything!
What will we do?

211
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,242
She thinks we're gay. Not that
there's anything wrong with it.

212
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:29,128
No, no, of course not. People's
personal sexual preferences...

213
00:10:29,289 --> 00:10:31,041
...are nobody's business
but their own.

214
00:10:34,249 --> 00:10:35,523
- Hi.
- Hi.

215
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:37,042
Elaine, right? Nice to meet you.

216
00:10:37,209 --> 00:10:40,326
- Thanks for meeting with me.
- Sure. Would you like to take a seat?

217
00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:42,081
- Sure.
- Thank you.

218
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,604
Why don't you take your coat off?

219
00:10:47,009 --> 00:10:49,477
So she kept insisting
I take off my coat.

220
00:10:49,729 --> 00:10:53,927
I refused, and then she forcibly
tried to get me to remove it.

221
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:56,205
She didn't take her coat off
in my house, either.

222
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:00,366
You know there are tribes in Indonesia
where if you keep your coat on...

223
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,520
...in somebody's house,
the families go to war.

224
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,361
Give me a break.

225
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:07,083
So you don't take your coat off,
and now everyone at NYU...

226
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,082
...thinks I'm gay. Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

227
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:11,887
Not at all.

228
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:15,525
- Take that coat off.
- I don't want to take it off.

229
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:18,157
Take your coat off, already.

230
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:22,679
When will we see it?
I'd like to read the article.

231
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,328
They're sending it to me.

232
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,207
All right, well...

233
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:29,327
- Here you go. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

234
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,847
Two tickets to Guys and Dols.
I'm gonna go with you.

235
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,278
Guys and Dols?
Isn't that a lavish Broadway musical?

236
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:43,725
It's Guys and Dols,
not Guys and Guys.

237
00:11:44,609 --> 00:11:46,918
You're right. Guys and Dols.
Thanks very much.

238
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,206
- All right.
- All right, well...

239
00:11:50,489 --> 00:11:53,959
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, Lainey!

240
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:59,565
The Colected Works
of Bette Midler.

241
00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:06,366
What? I-
I thought you liked Bette Midler.

242
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,121
She's all right.

243
00:12:08,289 --> 00:12:10,883
- You said you liked her.
- So what? Maybe I do like her.

244
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:13,517
- So what?
- So nothing.

245
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:18,767
- Well, thanks for the CDs.
- Yeah, you're welcome.

246
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:24,324
Why are those two people
pointing at you over there?

247
00:12:24,849 --> 00:12:26,328
I don't know.

248
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,926
- What've you got there?
- The New York Post.

249
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:35,239
They've got an article about you.

250
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:38,518
"Although they maintain
separate residences...

251
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:43,683
...the comedian and his longtime
companion seem to be inseparable."

252
00:12:43,849 --> 00:12:46,283
Oh, no, The Associated Press
picked up the NYU story.

253
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:47,802
That's gonna be in every paper.

254
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:50,483
I've been outed. I wasn't even in.

255
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:53,887
Now everyone's gonna
think we're gay.

256
00:12:54,049 --> 00:12:56,609
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

257
00:12:56,769 --> 00:12:57,963
No, not at all.

258
00:13:03,369 --> 00:13:07,248
"Within the confines
of his fastidious bachelor pad...

259
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:11,402
...Seinfeld and Costanza bicker over
the cleanliness of a piece of fruit...

260
00:13:11,569 --> 00:13:15,039
...like an old married couple."
I told you that pear was washed.

261
00:13:19,849 --> 00:13:22,158
I thought we were friends.

262
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,282
Here we go.

263
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:30,838
I mean, how could you two keep this
a secret from me?

264
00:13:31,009 --> 00:13:33,967
- It's not true.
- Enough lying.

265
00:13:34,129 --> 00:13:35,721
The lying is through.

266
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:38,198
Come on, Jerry,
the masquerade is over.

267
00:13:38,369 --> 00:13:41,327
You're thin, late 30s, single.

268
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:44,163
- So are you.
- Yeah.

269
00:13:54,609 --> 00:13:56,679
- Hello.
- George?

270
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,727
Mrs. Seinfeld?

271
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:01,562
Oh, my God.

272
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,288
Oh, my God. Ma?

273
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:07,041
- Jerry?
- Ma.

274
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,006
Oh, my God!

275
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,359
My mother!

276
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,244
- Jerry.
- Ma, it's not true.

277
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:17,804
It was those culottes
you made him wear when he was 5.

278
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:20,039
They weren't culottes.
They were shorts.

279
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,440
They were culottes! You bought
them in the girls' department.

280
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:27,238
By mistake.
By mistake, Jerry. I'm sorry.

281
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:30,321
It looked like he was wearing a skirt,
for crying out loud.

282
00:14:30,489 --> 00:14:32,127
It has nothing to do
with the culottes.

283
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:34,757
Not that there's anything wrong
with that, Jerry.

284
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:41,002
I open up the paper, and this
is what I have to read about?

285
00:14:41,169 --> 00:14:42,887
I fell right off the toilet.

286
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:46,803
My back went out again.
I couldn't move.

287
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,005
The super had to come
and help me up.

288
00:14:49,169 --> 00:14:50,727
I was half-naked.

289
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:53,562
It's not true.

290
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,204
Every day it's something else
with you.

291
00:14:56,369 --> 00:14:58,280
I don't know anything
about you anymore.

292
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:01,282
Who are you?
What kind of life are you leading?

293
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:05,926
Who knows what you're doing.
Maybe you're making porno films.

294
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:07,443
Yeah.

295
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:08,837
I'm Buck Naked.

296
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,046
You're who? Buck Naked?

297
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:16,043
Jerry, I can see.
He's so neat and thin.

298
00:15:16,209 --> 00:15:17,881
Not that there's anything
wrong with it.

299
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,721
Of course not.

300
00:15:22,489 --> 00:15:25,765
Six-thirty, Scott.
Time for your sponge bath.

301
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,520
Six-thirty already? I fell asleep.

302
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:37,001
Let me help you off with that.
Here, I'll Just slip it over your head.

303
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:46,967
- The water's nice and warm, isn't it?
- Oh, that feels really good.

304
00:15:48,689 --> 00:15:51,487
George, are you
telling me the truth?

305
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:54,758
George, I'm talking to you!

306
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,641
Guess who left a message
on my machine.

307
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:04,119
That reporter from NYU.
I wonder what she wants.

308
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:09,999
All right.
Now the play is tomorrow night.

309
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:12,603
Would you like dinner first
or just meet at the theatre?

310
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:15,044
Excuse me, sir,
I'm sorry to bother you.

311
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:18,326
I want you to know that it took a lot
of guts to come out how you did...

312
00:16:18,489 --> 00:16:20,525
...and that you've inspired me
to do the same...

313
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:23,647
...even though that may mean
a discharge from the service. Thanks.

314
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:35,601
You know, I think I'll pass
on the Guys and Dols.

315
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:37,283
All right, fine, don't go.

316
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,202
I try and go out and do something
special for your birthday...

317
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:43,088
...and this is the thanks I get.
Everything's tainted now.

318
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:47,686
- Would you keep your voice down?
- No, I will not keep my voice down!

319
00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:49,959
Nothing can make me keep
my voice down!

320
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:54,281
If you boys cannot
control yourselves...

321
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:57,282
...then I'm afraid I'm going to
have to ask you to leave.

322
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:08,357
- Fine, I'll take Elaine.
- Yes.

323
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,168
Just don't say anything to Allison.

324
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,524
No, I won't.
Did she see the article?

325
00:17:13,689 --> 00:17:17,602
- No. Just imagine her reaction.
- Yeah.

326
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:20,039
- Oh, my God.
- What?

327
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,479
She hasn't seen the article.

328
00:17:22,889 --> 00:17:26,245
When she sees it,
she's gonna think...

329
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:30,278
I'm out, baby! I'm out!

330
00:17:34,649 --> 00:17:37,117
Yeah, so?

331
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:38,608
"Yeah, so?"

332
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:41,158
Well, this is nice.
They mention your name.

333
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:42,762
Don't you see what it says here?

334
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,840
Don't you understand
what that's implying?

335
00:17:45,009 --> 00:17:46,761
No. What?

336
00:17:47,209 --> 00:17:50,246
I'm gay. I'm a gay man.

337
00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:52,320
I'm very, very gay.

338
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:55,407
- You're gay?
- Extraordinarily gay.

339
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:57,321
Steeped in gayness.

340
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:00,328
I don't believe it.

341
00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:02,568
You don't believe me, ask Jerry.

342
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,727
- I will.
- What do you mean, you will?

343
00:18:04,889 --> 00:18:06,322
No, no, no. That's a bad idea.

344
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:10,846
- Jerry's a very private person.
- I wanna hear it from Jerry.

345
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:20,046
Oh, can you ever forgive me?

346
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,322
I don't know.

347
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:31,844
All right, I forgive you.

348
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:35,727
You know, the funny thing is,
I was attracted to you immediately.

349
00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:38,278
I was attracted to you too.
You remind me of Lois Lane.

350
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:52,962
Jerry! Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

351
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:56,043
What?

352
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,082
You're with a woman!

353
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:00,479
I know. What are you doing here?

354
00:19:00,649 --> 00:19:04,722
I leave you alone for two seconds,
and this is what you do?

355
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:06,845
I trusted you!

356
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:09,919
- Would you get the hell out of here?
- Stop it.

357
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:12,284
- What-? What's going on?
- Yeah, what's going on?

358
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:13,723
All right. Tell her. Go ahead.

359
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,561
- Tell her what?
- You know, about us.

360
00:19:15,729 --> 00:19:17,526
- Are you crazy?
- Tell her, Jerry. Tell her.

361
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,044
I'm telling her nothing.
Do you know what you're saying?

362
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,767
This- This is too weird.

363
00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:24,523
Wait a minute. You wrote the article.
Go ahead. Tell her.

364
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:25,838
I'm out of here.

365
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,319
It's not true! It's not true!

366
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:32,367
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

367
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:36,481
- You stupid idiot.
- Oh, please don't be upset.

368
00:19:36,649 --> 00:19:38,605
Oh, would you stop it
with that stuff?

369
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:41,718
What's going on?

370
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,561
All right, I'll tell you the truth.

371
00:19:44,009 --> 00:19:46,159
I'm not gay.

372
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,441
My name's Buck Naked.
I'm a porno actor.

373
00:19:56,049 --> 00:19:58,324
- Really?
- Oh, my God.

374
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,679
- Hey, how you doing?
- How you doing?

375
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,601
Hello.

376
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,046
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

377
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,803
All right, we'll see you later.

378
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:16,597
He's the phone man.

379
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,958
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

380
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,521
I am not gay.

381
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:36,846
I am, however,
thin, single and neat.

382
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,681
When someone is thin,
single and neat...

383
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:41,317
...people assume they're gay
because that's the stereotype.

384
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:44,686
We normally don't think of gay people
as fat, sloppy and married.

385
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:48,206
Although I'm sure there are, I don't
want to perpetuate the stereotype.

386
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:51,247
I'm sure they're the minority,
though, within the gay community.

387
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:54,287
Probably discriminated against.
Because of that, people say to them:

388
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:56,485
"You know, Joe,
I enjoy being gay with you...

389
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:00,562
...but it's about time you got in shape,
tucked your shirt in and lost the wife."

390
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:04,243
If people are gonna assume
that neat people are gay...

391
00:21:04,409 --> 00:21:06,001
...instead of doing this:

392
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,761
"I think Joe might be a little-"

393
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,921
They should vacuum.
"You know, I think Joe might be-"

394
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,203
Yeah.

395
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,561
I got a feeling he's a little-

396
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:26,360
