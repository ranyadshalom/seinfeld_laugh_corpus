Never mind, they're done.
All I have to do now is redo them.
615.807
615.883
You know, if you take everything
I've accomplished in my entire life...
619.146

and condense it down into one day,
it looks decent.

# KRAMER
636.886
That Peterman book is big business.
638.170
638.238
People wanna know
the stories behind the stories.

# JERRY
640.574
Nobody wants to go
on a three-hour bus tour...
642.801
642.876
of a totally unknown person's life.
645.308

I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get
a pizza bagel and dessert.

# KRAMER
651.933
Bite-size 3 Musketeers.
653.615
653.000

I think I understand this.
665.456
665.566
J. Peterman is real.

Talk to me.
672.317

672.317
But your life is Peterman's.
673.863
673.941
Now, the bus tour, which is real...
676.509
676.577
takes you to places that,
while they are real...
678.941
679.012
they are not real in the sense
that they did not really happen...
682.138
682.215
to the real Peterman, which is you.

# ELAINE
703.136
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you
at Pendant Publishing...
706.535
706.607
I believed in you, you know,
as a man of integrity.
710.165
710.243
But when I saw you
in that paper hat and that apron...
715.303
# MR.LIPPMAN
715.382
What if I cut you in
for 30 percent of the profits?
717.814
# ELAINE
717.884
Deal. Here's your problem:
720.179
720.600
**LOL**
721.221
You're making just the muffin tops.
724.119
724.191
What do you mean?
726.124
726.124
You gotta make the whole muffin.
728.057
728.128
Then you...
730.924
732.866
pop the top, toss the stump.
735.730
736.400
**LOL**
# MR.LIPPMAN

Taste.
738.935
741.200
**LOL**
# MR.LIPPMAN
743.377
So, what do we do with the bottoms?
744.923
# ELAINE
744.923
Give them to a soup kitchen.
746.469
# MR.LIPPMAN
746.546
It's a good idea.
747.694
# ELAINE
747.694
And one more thing.
748.841
748.915
Do you really think
we need the exclamation point?
751.245
751.318
Because it's not,
"Top of the muffin to you!"

Don't you know
what's gonna happen?

Every time you shave it, it's gonna
come in thicker and fuller and darker.

842.743
"They don't have homes.
Don't have jobs.
844.674
844.745
What do they need the top of a muffin
for? They're lucky to get the stumps."
848.246

If the homeless don't like them,
the homeless don't have to eat them.
