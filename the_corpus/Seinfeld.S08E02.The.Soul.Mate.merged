You know, I can now bite
my fingernails so evenly...
7.969

I don't even need
to use a clipper anymore.
10.201
10.278
But it's a pleasure to use clippers.
11.970
10.900
**LOL**

Why gnaw away like a mental patient
when we have this elegant device?

18.953
What if you're in prison?
20.418
20.488
You don't think they give clippers?
21.903
21.903
No, it's like a weapon.
23.318
23.391
You know what's really a weapon,
that big toenail.
25.789
25.860
You let that grow for a month,
take it in the shower, it's like a shiv.
29.623

31.299
I love prison.

Well, you should choose the poem
since you knew Susan best...
69.163

at the time
of her unfortunate... accident.
73.171

Yes.
79.571
# JERRY
79.647
So?
80.975
# GEORGE
81.048
He did it right as he said,
"Her unfortunate accident."
84.584
# JERRY
84.652
Not getting it.
85.946
# GEORGE
86.020
Jerry, a throat clear is a non-verbal
implication of doubt.
88.884
88.956
He thinks I killed Susan.

Okay. I'm just not gaga over her.

# CAROL
120.655
All right.
122.279

Do you really think I'm wrong

If you really wanna test him out...

Jerry Lewis?

**LOL**
# JERRY
176.243
I heard when Jerry left a meeting...
177.510
177.578
he'd purposely leave a briefcase
with a tape recorder in it.
180.476
180.700
**LOL**
180.548
After five minutes, he'd come back,
listen to what everyone said.
184.106
# GEORGE
184.185
That's pretty paranoid.
185.031
# JERRY
185.031
Yes, it is.

**LOL**
# KRAMER
255.656
She has delicate beauty.
257.485

Jerry wouldn't know delicate
if it bludgeoned him over the head.
260.559
261.100
**LOL**
# KRAMER
260.628
And yet, he's my friend.
263.561
# NEWMAN
263.631
And therein lies the tragedy.
265.824
265.900
**LOL**
265.900
For I believe, sadly for you...
269.026
269.103
that there is but one woman
meant for each of us.
272.434
272.506
One perfect angel
for whom we are put on this earth.
276.007
# KRAMER
276.077
Oh, that's beautiful, Newman.

279.713
we ceaselessly yearn for throughout
our dreary workaday lives...
284.773
284.852
and you, my friend,
have found your angel.
288.945
289.023
I can tell...
290.715
290.791
for my heart has also been captured
by a breathless beauty...
294.691

Ever since Susan passed on,
I have good days and bad.

Some days I'm haunted
by one word:

Why?

381.782
Why Susan?

Although, I might replace
her tortoise clip...
595.451
595.529
with one of those velvet scrunchies.
I love those.

# JERRY

You've got really specific tastes.

Oh, I know what I want, Jerry.
601.766

**LOL**
# JERRY
602.169
She got nice calves.
603.566
# KRAMER
603.637
Oh, she's a dreamboat,
but you don't like her.
607.366
# JERRY
607.441
Maybe I could.
You're making some good points.
609.566

**LOL**
# KRAMER
609.643
No, you can't, Jerry.

611.643
# KRAMER
611.712
Oh, no, you don't.
612.507
# JERRY
612.507
Why not?
613.302
613.380
The voice, the calves, the bacon.
614.346
# KRAMER
614.346
What?
615.311
# JERRY
615.382
I think I can.
I even like the name Pam.

Don't despair, my friend.
640.171

I won't allow your love

What, again with you?
648.613
# NEWMAN
648.682
Sorry.
650.010
649.400
**LOL**
650.083
But love is a spice
with many tastes...
653.084
653.153
a dizzying array of textures
and moments.
658.122
658.400

If only I could say things like that
around her.

# ELAINE
664.965
Well, I hear three distinct sounds:
667.056
667.134
A low rumple...
669.065
669.136
followed by a metallic squink...
671.830

671.905
Yes, yes, I heard the squink.
673.836
674.000
**LOL**

Followed by a mysterious galonk.
677.909

**LOL**
# GEORGE
678.378
It's a real baffler, isn't it?
680.742
# ELAINE
680.814
Well, one question
does come to mind.
683.439
684.985
Have you considered just asking them
what happened to the briefcase?
690.682
690.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
691.492
They would never tell me.
692.820
693.293
First of all, they probably think
that I killed Susan.
696.226
696.296
Besides, I don't even think
they like me.
698.864
699.300

# JERRY

That Pam. I am gaga over her.
701.432
# ELAINE

"Gaga"? When did that happen?
703.001
# JERRY
703.070
Yesterday, 6-ish.
705.502
705.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
706.740
Well, maybe we should double.
I'm pretty gaga myself.
710.037
# JERRY
710.110
You just met the guy yesterday.
711.837
# ELAINE
711.912
Yeah, but we have a common goal.
713.604
# JERRY
713.680
A barren, sterile existence
that ends when you die?
717.011
# ELAINE
718.218
Yeah.
720.047
720.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
720.721
You believe this guy
doesn't wanna have kids?
722.846
# ELAINE
722.923
Yeah, of course.
724.304
# JERRY
724.304
A guy will say anything to a woman.
725.685
# ELAINE
725.759
Oh, please, he wouldn't say that.
727.690
# GEORGE
727.761
Elaine, I once told a woman
that I coined the phrase:
731.024
731.098
"Pardon my French."
732.529
733.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
734.868
I once told a woman I don't eat cake
because it goes right to my thighs.
738.904
739.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
740.474
Once told a woman
I enjoy spending time with my family.

I got a free sample of it
in with my junk mail.

# KRAMER
785.352
There really is no junk mail.

Everybody wants a check
or birthday card...

# KEVIN
1026.490
Oh, yeah.

Like last summer, I'm watching TV
and I saw one of those jet skis.
1030.796
1031.832
Four thousand dollars later,
and it's sitting in my garage.
1034.594

# ELAINE
1034.668
You know, that's weird actually,
because I'm sort of the same way.
1037.999
1038.071
I mean, once for, like, no reason,
I flattened my hair...
1041.766
1041.842
and I had all these strands
hanging in my face all the time.
1045.673
1045.000

Sometimes I think I do want kids,
