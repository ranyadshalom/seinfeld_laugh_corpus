10.372
10.441
You brought your
queen out too fast.
12.949
13.486
What do you think, she's a feminist
looking to get out of the house?
17.204

No, the queen is old-fashioned.
Likes to stay home, cook.
23.054

That's pretty sick.
69.715
# GEORGE
69.794
I don't see how I could perform
sexually after something like that.
73.429
73.548
I was completely emasculated.

79.706
# GEORGE
79.706
All right.
80.942

You wanna know what
one of her favourite expressions is;
83.783
83.850
"Happy, pappy?"
85.943
86.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
86.603
"Happy, pappy?"
What does that mean?
88.280
# GEORGE
88.354
If she wants to know if I'm pleased
with something, she'll say;

"Happy, pappy?"

So that's not so bad.
99.851
99.851
Come on. What, are you kidding?
101.129
101.201
So tell her not to say it.
102.712
103.245
I'm much more comfortable
criticizing people behind their backs.
106.262
106.700
**LOL**
107.874
Look who's talking.
You just broke up with Melanie...
110.347
110.419

I'm really gonna do something

I think I'm gonna call Melanie again.
So what if she shushed me?

I got engaged. I'm getting married.
724.766
724.841
I asked Susan to marry me.

738.000
**LOL**
739.522
And do you know why?
741.781
741.858
It's because of that talk we had.
744.117
744.194
You were my inspiration.
Do you believe it? You.
747.544
747.614
That lunch was the defining moment

And she said yes?
757.108
# GEORGE
757.108
Well...
758.427
758.500
it took a couple hours of convincing,
but I was persistent.
761.804
761.400
**LOL**
761.879
I was just like those guys
in the movies, and it worked.
764.552
764.632
She said yes.
I can't believe my luck...
767.483
767.551
that she was still available,
a beautiful woman like that.
771.483
771.555
You think she's good-looking, right?
773.648
774.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
774.058
You're gonna have gorgeous kids.
775.782
# GEORGE
775.851
She's got great skin.
She's got a rosy glow.
778.240
# JERRY
778.312
A pinkish hue?
779.506
# GEORGE
779.506
Oh, she's got the hue.
780.701
780.300
**LOL**
782.775
So, what's going on with Melanie?
I know you're not getting married...
787.039
787.113
but things are happening?
788.367
# JERRY
788.367
Well...
789.621
789.699
actually, we kind of broke up.
793.797
793.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
794.162
You what?
795.341
# JERRY
795.538
Well, we were having dinner,
and she's got the strangest habit.
798.509
798.583
She eats her peas one at a time.
801.684
802.100
**LOL**
801.836
You've never seen anything like it.
It takes her an hour to finish them.
805.140
805.215
We've had dinner other times.
806.893
806.967
I've seen her eat corn niblets,
but she scooped them.
810.815
811.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
812.931
She scooped the niblets?
814.482
# JERRY
814.482
Yes.
816.032
816.101
That's what was so vexing.
818.822
818.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
824.610
What about the pact?
825.615
# JERRY
825.615
What?
826.619
# GEORGE
826.695
What happened to the pact?
828.337
828.405
We were gonna change.
We shook hands on a pact.
830.628
830.699
Did you not shake my hand
on a pact?
832.709
# JERRY
832.785
You stuck your hand out,
so I shook it.
836.336
836.200
**LOL**
836.414
I don't know about a pact.
837.842
837.915
Anyway, you should be happy.
You're engaged.
840.423
840.501
You're getting married.
842.060
# GEORGE
843.004
Well, it's not that. I just... You know,
I thought that we were both...
846.804
# JERRY
846.883
You thought
I was gonna get married?
849.022
# GEORGE
849.093
Well, maybe not married, but...
851.316
# JERRY
851.387
I mean, you love Susan, right?
853.361
# GEORGE
854.057
Yeah.
855.734
856.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
855.808
You wanna spend
the rest of your life with her.
858.400
# GEORGE
861.481
Yeah.
863.075
862.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
863.650
So?
865.541
# GEORGE
867.320
Yeah.
869.212
869.573
This doesn't make any difference.
870.957
# JERRY
870.957
No.
872.342
873.493
So we're still on to see Firestorm?
875.103
# GEORGE
875.103
Yeah.
876.713
# JERRY
876.788
I'll pick you up at your apartment.
We'll go to the 8.
879.379
# GEORGE
879.583

881.051
# JERRY
881.051
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second!

Champagne?
887.410
# JERRY
887.410

How often do you get engaged?
890.399
890.469
Come on.
891.598
# GEORGE
891.598
Okay. All right.
892.727
# JERRY
897.685
You know what?
899.742
903.232
No champagne.
905.076
904.900
**LOL**
912.100
**LOL**
913.493

**LOL**
930.635
Will you shut up?
932.443
932.512
Is that a new song?
934.486
934.400
**LOL**
934.556
All right, give me the rope.
936.234
# ELAINE
936.308
What? What do you need
a rope for?
938.235
# NEWMAN
938.310
Look, I don't have time to explain.
939.670
# ELAINE
939.670
Oh, I don't know.
941.031
941.104
I'm thinking
maybe we shouldn't do this.
942.948
# NEWMAN
943.023
I knew you'd back out.
944.301
# ELAINE
944.301
Are we doing a bad thing?
945.579
# KRAMER
945.651
Look, we drop the dog off in front
of somebody's house in the country.
949.618
949.696
They find it and adopt it.
951.504
951.573
Now the dog is prancing in the fields,
dancing and prancing.
955.802
955.869
Fresh air, dandelions.
958.009
958.080
We're doing this dog a huge favour.
960.422
# ELAINE
961.208
Yeah, yeah.

# JERRY
979.293
Oh, how come?
980.945
# GEORGE
981.270
Well, I didn't really tell Susan
about it...
983.577
983.648
and she doesn't really
have anything else to do.
986.784
987.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
986.860
She can come.
988.240
# GEORGE
988.945
Well, she doesn't
really wanna see Firestorm.
991.963
# JERRY
994.200
She....
995.545

That can't be the dog.

I can't, Jerry. I'm sworn to secrecy.

All right. But then I can't tell you
the big news.

All right, Elaine.
But this is beyond news.
1282.920
1282.997
This is like Pearl Harbor
or the Kennedy assassination.
1285.504
1285.583
It's, like, not even news,
it's total shock.

Oh, come on, Jerry. Please, please,
please, please, please.

I have a receipt for a rental car
with your signature...
1325.259
1325.332
including a report of some damage
to the rear seat.
1328.552
1327.100

1328.960
It seems as if the springs
were so compressed...
1331.183
1331.255
that they collapsed the right side.

Don't worry about a thing.
1351.450

In 20 minutes, that place
will be swarming with mailmen.
1354.662

We'll be back on the street
by lunch.
