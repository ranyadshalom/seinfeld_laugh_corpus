We're constantly going
to beaches, pools, lakes, rivers.
7.440
7.508
We're swimming, we're snorkeling,
we're scuba-diving.
10.577
10.644
We bathe in it.
Our bodies are mostly made of water.
13.178
13.247
Everyone's carrying around
these bottles of water.
15.679
15.750
We can't get enough water.
17.147
16.800
**LOL**
17.218
Unless it rains...
18.512

then we're like,
"Oh, look, I'm soaked.
20.813
21.400
**LOL**
22.056
I am literally drenched."
24.624
24.900

For some reason, we have a huge
problem with small, flying water.

Her father is so religious.

It's a stuffed meat thing.
106.072
106.140
Israeli soldiers carry it in case
they're captured behind enemy lines.

They eat it and it kills them.

You see? We were made
for each other.
123.785
124.091
It's amazing. If I reach out
and touch her breast right now...
127.490
127.561
she'd scream and throw me
out of the car.
129.754
129.830
But at this time tomorrow,
I could touch it all I want.

Sex is like joining a private club.

I'll be the same me tomorrow...
144.843

but suddenly the "no trespassing"

This is not fair! It's not fair.
630.562
630.631
I don't like this.
I don't like it one bit.
632.596
# JERRY
632.666
What do you want me to do?
You wanna see Rachel naked?
635.166
# GEORGE
635.235
Yes! Yes!
637.633
636.800
**LOL**
637.704
Yeah, right.
639.403
639.403
The punishment should fit the crime.
641.103
# JERRY
641.174
You could see me naked.
I could offer you that.
643.674
643.800
**LOL**
# GEORGE
644.244
It's like I'm Neil Armstrong.
645.936
646.013
I turn around for a sip of Tang
and you jump out first!
650.174

**LOL**
# ELAINE
653.420
Nobody ever called me
breathtaking before.
655.681
# JERRY
655.756
I've never been called
breathtaking either.
658.381
658.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
658.825
I mean, if he thinks that
that baby is breathtaking...
662.122
662.229
then who's not breathtaking?
664.058
# JERRY
664.131
Maybe he just said it
because the mother was in the room.
666.791
# ELAINE
666.867
Yeah. Right.
That's a possibility.
669.401
669.469
I have to find out.
670.968
# JERRY
671.038
How you gonna do that?
672.402
# ELAINE
672.402
I can be very clever.
673.766
# RACHEL
673.840
I'm gonna take a swim.
675.505
# ELAINE
675.505
Oh, me too. I'll meet you down there.
677.171
677.678
Don't go in.
Rachel's getting undressed.
679.837

679.913
Oh, okay.

# GEORGE
689.154
I'm sorry.
690.621
690.691
Not like I'll see something
I've never seen before.
693.089
# JERRY
693.160
You might have.
693.807
# GEORGE
693.807
I didn't.
694.454

694.528
You won't.

# RACHEL
697.164
What do you want anyway, George?
698.822
# JERRY
698.899
Yes, George. I'm kind of
wondering myself.
702.696
702.769
What is it that you want?
705.133
705.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
705.205
No, I was just wondering
if you guys had any gum.
709.674
710.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
711.645
So you were swimming
in the pool...
714.270
714.347
and you wanted some gum.
716.677
715.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
716.750
Yes, because the water
was cold...
719.910
719.986
and the chewing warms me up.
722.782
722.800
**LOL**
# RACHEL
724.624
We don't have any gum.
726.692

Okay. Thanks anyway.

Strange man.
733.359

Wait till you get to know him.
735.694
735.500
**LOL**
# RACHEL
736.336
So where is this baby, anyway?
737.803
# JERRY
737.803
Oh, check it out.
739.269
739.339
I guarantee you've never seen
anything quite so objectionable.
742.272
743.500

743.477
It's down the hall,
third door on your left.

# RACHEL
753.687
Oh, my God!
755.277
755.800
**LOL**
755.355
I'm sorry, I thought this was
the baby's room.

758.425
I'm really sorry.

**LOL**
# GEORGE
776.042
Did she do it on purpose?
777.439
# JERRY
777.511
It was my fault.
I told her the wrong door.
780.478
# GEORGE
780.647
I was supposed to see her.
She wasn't supposed to see me.
783.580
783.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
783.884
So what?
785.144
# GEORGE
785.619
Well, ordinarily I wouldn't mind.
But...
789.815
# JERRY
790.023
But what?
791.249
# GEORGE
792.659
Well, I'd just got back
from swimming in the pool...
796.490
796.563
and the water was cold.
798.096
799.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
800.567
You mean shrinkage.
801.948
# GEORGE
801.948
Yes.
803.329
803.500
**LOL**
804.838
Significant shrinkage.
806.530
# JERRY
806.606
So you feel you were shortchanged?
808.537
# GEORGE
808.608
Yes.
810.175
809.700
**LOL**
810.243
If she thinks that's me, she's under
a complete misapprehension.
813.312
813.380
That was not me, Jerry.
That was not me.
815.345
815.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
815.415
Well, so, what's the difference?
817.346
# GEORGE
817.417
What if she discusses it with Jane?
819.196
# JERRY
819.196
Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.
820.975
# GEORGE
821.054
How do you know?
822.019
# JERRY
822.019
Women aren't like us.
822.985

823.056
They're worse!
They're much worse than us.

823.700

They talk about everything.
827.486
827.561
Could you tell her about
the shrinkage factor?
829.652

829.729
No. I'm not gonna tell her
about your shrinkage.
831.956

Besides, I think women know
about shrinkage.

It used to be much bigger,

At MacLeish's Fish Market?

# KRAMER

No. I got them in the ocean.

The ocean? What do you mean?

# KRAMER
967.000
Well, I found this rope
and I kept tugging on it...
970.661
970.737
all these lobsters came up.
972.498
# MICHAEL
973.506
Those are commercial lobster traps.
You can't take lobsters from there.
976.769
976.843
That's against the law.

# KRAMER
977.939
Hey, take it easy.

There are plenty of lobsters
in the ocean for everyone.

My father was a lobsterman.
984.441

986.486
and came home at night
stinking of brine.
988.679
988.400

He sent me through law school

It was built by Mark Farbman.

Well, to tell you the truth,

1044.671
1044.100
**LOL**
1044.744
I was surprised to hear you use
a word like "breathtaking"...
1048.780
1048.848
to describe a baby.
1050.643
1050.717
I mean, because you also
used it referring to me.
1054.048

You're the ones who are

1091.923

**LOL**
# JANE
1095.662
I don't know what
you're talking about.
1097.457
1097.530
I think that you think...
1099.461
1099.532
that a certain something
is not all that it could be...
1102.192
1102.268
when, in fact, it is
all that it should be and more.

was enjoying the lobster so much.
1137.900
1137.971

couldn't hurt.

A little breakfast?
1212.161
# JERRY
1212.161
Yeah.
1213.178
# GEORGE
1213.246
And you eat eggs, don't you?
1214.445
# RACHEL
1214.445
Yes, I do.
1215.644
1215.715
All right.
1217.164
1217.164
Thank you.
1218.613
# JERRY
1219.819
Delicious. Where did you learn
to make eggs like this?
1222.513
# RACHEL
1222.822
These are so good.
1225.220
# GEORGE
1225.291
Enjoying them?
1227.018
# RACHEL
1227.093
Oh, good.
1228.683
1230.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1229.996
You know, you might wanna try
eating it with one of these.
1235.261
1234.400
**LOL**
# RACHEL
1236.736
There's lobster in these eggs?
1238.804
# GEORGE
1238.871
Not that much.
1240.063
1240.139
You know, they tend
to shrink in the water.
1242.764
1242.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
1245.011
Well, I guess I gotta go too.
1247.579
1247.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1248.314
Well, this has turned out
to be one hell of a weekend.
1251.872

# MICHAEL
1252.652
Excuse me.

# POLICE
1257.590
Sorry to bother you.
1258.748
1258.825
We're trying to track down
a lobster poacher...
1261.120
1261.194
that cleaned out one of the traps.
1263.023
# KRAMER
1263.162
I wonder what's going on.
1264.354
# GEORGE
1265.064
Guess I should go up
and apologize.
1267.530
# MICHAEL
1268.134
There he is, officer.
1269.601
# RACHEL
1269.601
Yeah.
1271.067
1271.300
**LOL**
1273.840
Don't you ever knock?!
1275.737
1276.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1278.211
I don't know why Rachel had
to drive back with Michael and Carol.
1281.303
# ELAINE
1281.381
Hey, if you saw me naked...
1282.675
1282.749
I wouldn't wanna ride
in the same car with you either.
1285.409
1285.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
1285.485
I still can't believe
Michael finked on Kramer.
1287.780
# ELAINE
1287.854
How is he gonna pay off
a $1000 fine?
1291.287
# JERRY
1291.357
They got some sort of program.
1293.721
1295.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1298.531
What?
1300.121
1304.937
Hey, there's a tomato stand.
Let's stop. I can get some more.
1308.529
# JERRY
1308.841
Hey, isn't that Michael's car?
1311.205
# ELAINE
1311.311
There's Rachel.
1312.476
# GEORGE
1312.476
Where?
1313.641
1315.200
**LOL**
1324.290
Look at the work that people
will do to get to the ocean.
1328.190
1328.261
They'll fight traffic and the heat
and the parking and the hot sand...
1331.626
1331.698
trying to get through the waves...
1333.459
1333.533
and the ironic thing is...
1334.998
1335.068
the ocean doesn't
even really want us in there.
1338.626
1338.400
**LOL**
1338.705
That's what surfing is.
1339.931
1340.006
Surfing is the ocean
throwing us out of itself.
1343.940
1344.000
**LOL**
1344.010
You see?
1345.577
1345.678
We keep trying to paddle in...
1347.177
1347.246
and the ocean is saying,
"No, you don't."
1350.076
1350.300
**LOL**
1350.350
The ocean is like a nightclub...
1351.974
1352.051
and the waves are bouncers
tossing us out.
1354.984
1355.200
**LOL**
1355.054
The undertow is like
the really mean bouncer.
1357.179
1357.256
Instead of throwing you out, they take
you in the back and rough you up.
1360.587
1363.300
**LOL**
1371.200
**LOL**
