I don't think people think of their office
as a workplace. I think they think of it...
3.843
1.800
**LOL**
3.868
as a stationery
store with Danish.
6.304
6.800
**LOL**
6.352
You know what I mean?
You wanna get your pastry...
8.647
8.721
your envelopes, your supplies...
10.880
10.956
your toilet paper, six cups of coffee,
and you go home.
14.025
12.700
**LOL**
14.393
Why do people that work in offices...
16.154
16.228
have pictures of their family
on their desk facing them?
19.525
19.665
Do they forget that they're married?
21.790
21.867
Do they go, "5:00. Time to hit the bars
and pick up hookers.
24.800
22.600
**LOL**
24.870
Hold it a second.
26.961
26.000
**LOL**
27.039
I got a wife and three kids.
I better get home.
29.767
29.842
I completely forgot."
31.307
36.200
**LOL**
38.317
She hasn't told her father yet?
40.130
# GEORGE
40.130
No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.
41.944
# JERRY
42.021
"We're"? What do you mean, "we're"?
43.584
# GEORGE
43.584
Susan wants me to be there.
45.147
# JERRY
45.224
You're meeting the father
for the first time?
47.622
# GEORGE
47.693
Yeah.
49.859
# JERRY
49.859
You'll make quite an impression on him...
52.025
51.800
**LOL**
52.097
when you tell him how
you burned his cabin down.
54.791
55.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
56.035
I didn't burn it down. Kramer did.
58.467
# JERRY
58.537
I mean, the whole thing is ironic.
Think of it.
61.970
62.041
The guy's nice enough to give you
a box of very fine Cuban cigars...
65.167
# GEORGE
65.244
I know what happened.
66.028
# JERRY
66.028
No, wait.
66.811
66.879
Then you dump them off onto Kramer.
68.476
# GEORGE
68.476
I know.
70.073
# JERRY
70.149
Who proceeds to burn
the man's cabin down...
74.413
74.486
with one of those
very same cigars.
77.987
78.424
It's very comical.
80.822
81.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
81.627
Maybe we shouldn't
start writing today.
83.661
83.729
I got a lot on my mind.
85.057
# JERRY
85.130
We've put this off long enough.
Today's the day.
87.494
# GEORGE
87.566
I wonder how Susan's
father's gonna react.
89.634
89.701
What's the worst he can do?
So you burn a house down.
92.133
92.204
Come on.
93.532
# JERRY
93.672
Not even a house. It's like a cabin.
95.501
# GEORGE
95.574
We could build a cabin like that.
97.266
# JERRY
97.342
Well, maybe not us,
but two men could.
100.070
100.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
102.081
BICs? What, did you get BICs?
103.478
# JERRY
103.549
What, you got a problem
with the pen, now?
105.549
# GEORGE
105.617
I like a Rolling Writer.
They're smooth.
107.514
# JERRY
107.586
All right, let's just get to work.
110.120
110.556
NBC pilot. Seinfeld Project.
112.817

Act 1, Scene A.
116.290
# GEORGE
116.361
So you're gonna sit there?
119.191
119.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
119.765
Let me explain to you...
121.127
121.200
one of the key elements involved
in the writing process.
123.894
123.969
Because it may seem outwardly...
125.559
125.637
that the pen and the paper
and the chair play a large role.
128.570
128.807
But they're all somewhat incidental
to the actual using of the brain.
134.209
134.300
**LOL**
134.379
Okay, so just... Just park yourself.
137.414
137.483
All right. Act 1, Scene A.
139.710
# GEORGE
139.785
Drink?
141.081

141.081
No. No drink.

Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?
155.333
# JERRY
155.333
Yes.
156.799

**LOL**
163.308
Hi, is Elaine there?
165.137
165.210
Oh, hi, Sandra.
166.902
167.679
Yeah, I can hold.
169.007
169.081
Every time I call, I gotta chitchat
with her assistant for, like, 20 minutes.
172.912
172.985
Oh, hi, Sandra. Listen,
I'm at a pay phone.
175.280
175.354
There's a lot of people
waiting to use it.
177.513
177.589
I'll be off in a minute!
180.487
180.100
**LOL**
180.559
Yeah, could you put me through
to Elaine?
182.524
182.594
Okay, thanks.
185.060
185.531
Are you thinking of ideas?
188.225
187.800
**LOL**
188.500
Is there any way I can
get you directly?
190.329
190.402
Every time I call, Sandra bends
my ear for, like, 20 minutes.
194.029
194.106
So we're on for later?
195.434
# ELAINE
195.541
Yeah, I'll come by after work.

197.876
Hey, I got a rubber-pencil thing
happening here.
200.809
200.700

202.047
I gotta go. I gotta go.
203.375

Okay, how about this:
213.788

I'm in my apartment.
You come in.

# GEORGE
217.529
It's beautiful.
219.597

And what do I say?
222.790
226.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
229.208
Could you do me a favor?
231.299
231.376
When my friends call...
233.000
233.278
could you not talk to them
for too long?
236.142
# SANDRA
236.715
Why, did Jerry say something?
238.510
# ELAINE
238.584
No. No.
240.174
# SANDRA
240.252
He must've said something.
241.649
# ELAINE
241.720
Oh, no, he didn't say anything.
243.185
# SANDRA
243.255
I can't work for you.
244.022
244.022
Oh, God.
244.788

I can't. I'm leaving.

# ELAINE
246.322
No, Sandra...

**LOL**
247.859
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am.
250.052
250.128
Listen, Jerry's under a lot
of pressure right now.
253.163
253.232
It's very hard being
a stand-up comedian.
256.028
256.101
Sometimes they don't laugh.
259.034
258.900
**LOL**

All right, let's get going.
263.170
263.170
All right, let's go to work.

No more golf.
274.533
# JERRY
274.533
Why?

# KRAMER
275.954
Remember I told you about the pro
at the Westchester Country Club...
279.080
279.157
who's letting me play every time
I gave him those Cuban cigars?
282.192
# JERRY
282.261
Yeah.
283.728
# KRAMER
283.728
Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire!
285.194
285.600

288.867
Hey, George, maybe you can
ask Susan's father for some more.
293.028
293.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
293.105
What are you, crazy?
294.433
294.506
I can't ask the guy for more cigars
after you burned down his cabin.
297.871
# KRAMER
297.943
What's one thing got to do
with another?

# GEORGE

Kramer, please.
302.274
# KRAMER
302.347
Well, I can't go back
to the public courses now.
304.642
304.716
I can't. I won't.
307.216
307.200
**LOL**
307.286
I mean, you know what that's like?
It's crowded.
309.581
309.655
The grass has
big brown patches in it.
311.985
312.057
They don't rake the sand traps.
313.522
312.800

313.592
Not to mention the caliber of people
you have to play with.
316.661
316.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
316.995
I can't help you. You're gonna have to
get them someplace else.
320.064
# KRAMER
320.132
Where? They're Cubans.
322.223
323.100

You know what? I should take off.
324.331
# JERRY
324.331
What?
325.661
# GEORGE
325.737
I gotta go to Susan's parents' house
for dinner.
328.601
328.674
I wanna shower first,
and I wanna leave plenty of time.
331.470
# JERRY
331.543
You got four hours.
What about the script?

I think we got a bite on it.

Doesn't George look like
your sister Sara?

A slight resemblance.

Her son's a podiatrist, you know.
352.228
# GEORGE
352.564
Oh, I have tremendous respect
for people who work with feet.
356.794
356.868
I mean, to dedicate yourself
to the foot...
359.801
360.539
You're toiling in virtual anonymity.
I mean...
364.166
364.400
**LOL**
# MR.ROSS
366.678
How are you enjoying those cigars
I gave you?
368.769

Oh, the cigars.
372.349
372.417
I'm sucking them down.

**LOL**
375.187
I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.
377.778
# MR.ROSS
377.856
You know, those cigars
are made special for Castro.
380.288
# GEORGE
381.193
I did not know that.

Daddy never laughs.
394.672

394.672
Oh, well, so what?
396.172
396.241
Laughter. What is that?
398.332
398.410
I mean, what is the point
of opening your mouth and going:
402.037
403.400
**LOL**
403.348
What is that?
405.143
# MR.ROSS
407.586
You know, you can't get
those cigars anywhere.

You and your cigars.

how'd you like the cabin?

# JERRY
432.811
After we get off the phone
you tell her?
434.640
434.713
Of course she knows it was me
who complained.
436.804

Now I'm responsible
for this woman quitting.

# JERRY
446.674
Oh, dial the number.

How could you do this?
452.919
# ELAINE
452.998
I was just trying to help you.

Trying to help me.

459.037
Hello. Sandra.
460.832
460.906
Hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld.
462.633
462.707
Listen, I wanted to tell you there's
been a terrible misunderstanding.
466.265
466.400
**LOL**
466.344
See, I told Elaine...
468.241
# JERRY
468.313
that it was a real treat
talking to you on the phone.
471.541
471.616
And she thought I was being sarcastic
because I'm a comedian, and all.
475.049
475.120
She thought, I think, "Yeah, it's a
real treat talking to her on the phone."
478.656
479.100
**LOL**
478.723
But I was really being sincere.
482.020
482.093
No, of course I like you.
484.593
485.030
Tonight?
486.825
486.900
**LOL**
490.335
Hold on a second.
491.663
491.736
She wants to have a drink with me.
492.918
492.918
Just go. Go.
494.100
494.172
Oh, I don't...
495.070
495.070
Go.
495.967
496.041
Yeah, I think I can.
498.439
498.400
**LOL**
499.110
Yeah, I know where that is.
500.905
500.979
Okay. I'll see you there.
Okay, bye.
504.674
504.749
Now I gotta have a drink with her.

# GEORGE
506.918
The cabin.
508.815

512.057
Susan?
514.523
514.000

# SUSAN
514.593
About the cabin...
515.843
# MR.ROSS
515.843
I love that place.
517.093
517.162
My father built that cabin in 1947.
520.857
520.932
My mother was recuperating
from impetigo at the time...
524.433
524.503
and Dad thought it would be a good
idea to get her out into the fresh air.
528.437
528.507
She died there the following winter.
530.302
531.400
**LOL**
533.278
And Dad passed away
10 years later to the day.
535.608
536.715
His last words to me were:
539.283
539.718
"Cherish the cabin."
542.116
542.700
**LOL**
545.590
Not, "Take care of your sister."
She's a paraplegic.
549.182
550.300
**LOL**
550.695
But, "Cherish the cabin."
554.060
554.132
And I have, for 45 years.
557.395
557.636
It's often been a sanctuary for me.

He built a Fortress of Solitude
up at the North Pole...

to, you know, sort of
get away from it all.

Well, the cabin is kind of...
599.408
599.477
George?
600.858
# GEORGE
600.858
Burned.
602.239
602.200
**LOL**
# MR.ROSS
604.149
Burned?
605.399
# SUSAN
605.399
There was a fire, and it...
606.649
# GEORGE
606.718
Burned.
608.251
608.400
**LOL**
# MR.ROSS
609.187
The cabin burned?
611.086

Yeah, burned.
612.984

**LOL**
# MRS.ROSS

Burned?
615.922
# MR.ROSS
615.994
Was anything found?
617.322
617.395
Was it all burned to the ground?
Did they find anything?
620.521
# SUSAN
620.599
No. Nothing.
621.980
# MRS.ROSS
621.980
Nothing?
623.361
624.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
625.470
But, you know, Mr. Ross,
if you look at the whole situation...
628.334
628.406
what with it being your cigars
and everything...
631.066
631.142
it's really rather ironic.
633.107
633.178
One might even say,
in a sense, comical.
636.372
637.600
**LOL**
638.617
Really. Think about it.
641.481
# SANDRA
641.553
I can't believe you said that.
642.883
# JERRY
642.883
What?
644.213
# SANDRA
644.289
How could you say
something like that to me?
646.619
# JERRY
646.691
What? You were the one
who was talking dirty.
649.225
649.294
I was just trying to keep up.
650.793
# SANDRA
650.862
That was a weird thing to say.
652.777
651.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
652.777
Why? It didn't mean anything.
654.693
654.766
I was trying to join in
so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.
657.391
# SANDRA
657.469
Oh, I think you're really sick.
659.601
# JERRY
659.601
I'm not sick.
661.733
661.000
**LOL**
661.840
You said much sicker things
than me.
663.931
664.400
**LOL**
# SANDRA
664.876
I'm leaving.
665.921
# JERRY
665.921
You're making too much of this.
666.967
# SANDRA
667.045
Excuse me.
668.373
# JERRY
668.446
Let me walk you to a cab.
669.492
# SANDRA
669.492
That's okay.
670.537
# JERRY
670.615
The main thing is that this is
just between us.
673.115
672.100
**LOL**
673.184
And that'll be the end of it.
674.616
# SANDRA
674.616
Oh, really?
676.048
# JERRY
676.121
I mean, people, they're not interested
in things like this.
678.883
677.400
**LOL**
678.957
They don't wanna hear about it.
They really don't.
681.548
681.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
685.263
So we're drinking and talking.
687.388
687.465
And so she starts rubbing my leg.
689.931
# GEORGE
690.001
Wow, what did you do?
693.036
691.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
693.104
Have you ever told a woman
to stop touching your leg?
695.604
696.500
**LOL**
# GEORGE
696.808
Yeah. Right.
697.990
# JERRY
697.990
I know it's the wrong thing to do.
699.172
699.244
She works in Elaine's office.
But I can't get that hand off my leg.
702.643
702.714
I'm looking at the hand thinking,
"That hand should not be on my leg."
706.181
706.300
**LOL**
706.251
But I can't make my brain to get
my mouth to say the words:
710.082
710.155
"Would you mind?"
711.722
711.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
712.323
Yet women have no problem getting
the hand off. How do they do that?
715.722
# JERRY
715.794
I don't know. They're working
on a whole other level.
718.385
718.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
719.130
All right, so go ahead.
720.762
# JERRY
720.762
So then we go back to my apartment.
722.393
724.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
# JERRY
724.636
So we're fooling around there.
726.533
726.604
You know, it's getting
a little passionate.
728.695
728.773
And she starts with the dirty talking.
732.070
729.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
732.143
All right, all right. Hold on.
734.905
735.100
**LOL**
734.979
Time out.
737.070
738.717
What did she say?
740.718
740.500
**LOL**
# JERRY
740.718
You know. The usual.
742.719
# GEORGE
742.787
No, I don't know.
How do I know the usual?
744.912
745.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
744.989
Typical things.
746.586
# GEORGE
746.586
What's typical? Give me typical.
748.183
# JERRY
750.095
She says...
752.561
752.900
**LOL**
757.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
767.178
That's very dirty.
768.905
768.980
That's absolutely filthy.
771.913
771.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
771.983
And then she starts talking
about her panties.
774.278
# GEORGE
774.452
I'm gonna need some water here.
777.146
776.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
778.556
So I said something.
780.248
# GEORGE
780.492
Okay, what did you say?
782.025
# JERRY
782.093
Now, bear in mind,
I am just trying to keep up.
785.185
# GEORGE
785.263
Of course.
786.377
786.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
786.377
Okay.
787.490
787.565
So she's talking about her panties.
790.896
790.969
So...
793.003
793.800
**LOL**
793.738
So I said:
795.237
795.306
"You mean, the panties your mother
laid out for you."
798.534
801.700
**LOL**
808.200
**LOL**
# GEORGE
810.989
"The panties your mother
laid out for you"?
815.219
813.600
**LOL**
815.293
What does that mean?
816.577
# JERRY
816.577
I don't know.
817.861
817.600
**LOL**
819.631
It just popped out.
820.959
# GEORGE
821.032
Well, how did she react?
822.663
# JERRY
822.663
She flipped out. Just left.
824.295
# GEORGE
824.369
Well, that's not offensive.
825.902
825.970
It's abnormal, but it's not offensive.
828.436
827.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
828.506
Look, the main thing is I don't want
Elaine to know about any of this.
831.769
831.843
I mean, especially the pantie remark.
833.672
833.745
I mean, it's embarrassing.
She'd never let me hear the end of it.
836.746
836.848
What if this girl says something?
838.575
#  JERRY
838.650
She will. She's going back to work.
840.342
840.418
I talked her into it.
How stupid was that.
843.078
843.621
So Susan's father took that news
pretty hard, huh?
846.053
# GEORGE
846.124
Yeah. He went into the bedroom
and started sobbing.
848.852
# JERRY
848.927
Guess he didn't see the humor in it.
850.462
850.462
Yeah.
851.996
853.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
854.465

There's no two ways about it.

979.090
You're darn right I talked to her.
We talked up a storm.
982.023
980.800
**LOL**
982.093
I've concluded,
from the basis the those talks...
984.320

that this isn't anybody
you should be talking to.
