Have you noticed that every
little place you go into...
4.012
2.900
**LOL**
4.037
lately has that tip
jar on the counter?
6.488
6.539
What is the service that
this tip is for, anyway?
9.212
7.200
**LOL**
9.291
I mean, isn't the man basically
just turning around?
12.890
12.700
**LOL**
12.961
Isn't that really all it is?
15.054
15.130
I think we're tipping people now just
for the absence of outright hostility.
19.891
20.100
**LOL**
20.343
"Thanks very much,
and here's something extra...
22.566
22.637
for not taking my head...
23.982
24.055
and smashing my face
through the glass countertop.
26.610
24.900
**LOL**
26.682
Really good service here."
29.403
28.600
**LOL**
33.300
**LOL**
33.730
Well, currently the doors on the
bathroom stalls here at the stadium...
37.827
37.901
don't offer much by way of privacy.
40.326
40.403
I was thinking, if we extend the doors
all the way down to the floor...
43.753
# MR. STEINBRENNER
43.823
Are you out of your mind?
You'd suffocate in there.
46.211
46.400
**LOL**
46.283
You're lucky to have doors.
When I was in the Army...
48.790
48.869
Costanza, what is that you're eating?
Looks pretty tasty.
51.590
# GEORGE
51.663
It's a calzone, sir.
52.650
# MR. STEINBRENNER
52.650
Calzone, huh?
53.636
53.706
Let's see it. Pass that down.
Let's get a look.
55.929
56.000
Big Stein wants a little taste.
Come on.
57.891
58.500
**LOL**
57.960
Pass it down. That's a good boy.
59.519
59.587
Okay, let's...
Hey, what's in this thing?
62.094
# GEORGE
62.548
Cheese, pepperoni, eggplant.
64.605
# MR. STEINBRENNER
64.675
Eggplant, huh?
That's a hell of a thing.
66.482
66.551
All right. Back to business.
Here you go.
68.525
67.200
**LOL**
68.595
Very good. Very good. Excellent.
70.105
70.180
Excellent little calzone you got there,
Costanza.
72.605
72.682
Okay. A little jealous.
All right. Here we go.
74.940
75.017
Like I told you last week...
76.315
76.394
the renovation of the press box
is taking too long.
79.115
79.188
That eggplant was very good.
80.865
81.200
**LOL**
80.939
Everybody out.
I've got eggplant on my mind.
83.162
83.233
Costanza, go get me a couple
of calzones right now.
85.622
85.694
Pronto. Move it out.
87.074
87.153
Big Stein wants an eggplant calzone.
He must have one.
90.005
89.600
**LOL**
90.072
Everybody out. Hurry up, hurry up.
91.964
93.033
Who are you having dinner with?
94.462
# ELAINE
94.743
Oh, one of these fabric wholesalers,
this guy Todd Gack.
98.710
98.600
**LOL**
99.164
I won a bet from him.
100.233
# JERRY
100.233
Yeah, what bet?
101.303
# ELAINE
101.374
He bet me that Dustin Hoffman
was in Star Wars.
106.978
106.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
108.172
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
109.367
109.367
Yeah.
110.561
110.633
Short Jewish guy against Darth Vader?
I don't think so.
114.397
114.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
114.678
Yeah, that's what I said.
116.320
# JERRY
116.388
So the bet was the loser
has to buy dinner?
118.860
# ELAINE
118.932
Yeah.
120.656
# JERRY
# ELAINE
121.893
What?
123.189
# JERRY
123.189
No, nothing.
124.484
128.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
128.565
What's with you?
129.344
# KRAMER
129.344
Feel this.
130.124
# JERRY
131.360
Wow, that's hot.
132.199
# KRAMER
132.199
Yes, piping hot.
133.037
133.111
It's fresh out of the dryer.
134.670
135.071
Hey, Elaine, you gotta
feel my pants.
137.164
137.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
138.157
I'll see you later.
139.502
# KRAMER
140.243
All right. You don't know
what you're missing.
142.584
142.662
I'm loving this.
144.006
144.246
I'll never put on another
piece of clothing...
146.339
146.415
unless it's straight from the dryer.
148.258
148.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
148.333
Every time you get dressed,
you'll use the basement dryer?
151.138
# KRAMER
151.211
Oh, yeah. It's a warm
and wonderful feeling, Jerry.
154.098
154.172
So, what are you doing later?
155.491
# JERRY
155.491
I got a date with Nicki.
156.810
# KRAMER
156.883
Oh, yeah, she's a beauty.
158.742
# JERRY
158.742
Oh, yeah. She's also quite bold.
160.601
# KRAMER
160.928
Bold and beautiful.
163.353
162.800
**LOL**
# MR. STEINBRENNER
163.847
This calzone is fantastic.
165.145
165.224
And look, the pita pocket
prevents it from dripping.
167.814
167.893
The pita pocket.
169.024
170.000
**LOL**
171.062
Yeah, what is it, Watson?
172.537
172.605
A lost and found, huh?
No, I don't think we need that.
175.196
175.274
If people can't hold onto things,
tough luck.
177.616
177.693
You got a little junk on your lip,
by the way.
179.869
180.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
179.945
You know, a lost and found
could be a good idea.
182.203
# MR. STEINBRENNER
182.281
Hold it, Watson.
183.625
183.698
You like the lost and found, George?
184.851
# GEORGE
184.851
Definitely.
186.005
# MR. STEINBRENNER
186.576
All right. A lost and found.
187.956
188.036
But there's gotta be a time limit.
We're not running a pawnshop here.
191.754
192.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
194.625
Hey, Elaine.
196.175
# ELAINE
196.175
Jerry, hi.
197.726
# JERRY
197.795
This is Nicki.
198.444

198.444
Hi.
199.092
# ELAINE
199.171
Hello. This is Todd Gack.
201.062
200.300
**LOL**
# JERRY
201.131
Oh, of course, Todd Gack.
203.188
203.258
Who did you bet was in Star Wars?
Sammy Davis Jr.?
205.564
206.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
208.554
So, what movie are you guys
gonna see?
210.314
210.389
Means to an End.
212.197
# ELAINE
212.266
We were gonna see that too,
but it's sold out.
214.821
214.100
**LOL**
214.893
So we're going to see
Blame It On The Rain.
217.401
# JERRY
218.271
Why don't you see what you can do.
219.465
# NIKKI
219.465
Okay.
220.660
# ELAINE
221.441
What 's she gonna do?
They don't have any more tickets.
224.245
# JERRY
224.485
We'll see.
225.783
# TODD
225.903
Hey, Jerry, you like cigars?
227.581
226.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
227.655
Yeah, why?
228.868
# TODD
228.868
I'm going to Montreal tomorrow.
230.080
230.157
They sell Cubans there dirt cheap.
232.000
232.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
232.075
That's a nice idea
for George's wedding.
234.084
# TODD
234.161
Should I get you a box?
235.456
# JERRY
235.456
If they're cheap, why not?
236.751
# TODD
236.830
All right, I'll buy them
and get them to Elaine.
239.337
# NIKKI
239.415
Okay. Two tickets.
240.760
240.833
Means to an End.
241.779
# JERRY
241.779
Told you.
242.724
243.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
243.294
How did you do that?
244.904
# NIKKI
244.904
I just talked to the manager.
246.513
# JERRY
246.672
All right, enjoy Blame It On The Rain.
249.178
# GEORGE
249.178
Nice meeting you.
251.683
251.000
**LOL**
256.055
So they're putting in
a lost and found because of me.
258.907
258.975
I mean, there's a time limit, but still.
261.612
261.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
262.519
They're really building
a Utopian society up there.
266.154
266.000
**LOL**
266.940
And you attribute this to the calzone?
268.276
# GEORGE
268.276
Yeah.
269.613
269.693
I'm like a drug dealer.
I got the guy hooked.
271.951
272.600
**LOL**
272.028
I'm having lunch at his desk every day
this week, just him and me.
275.082
275.156
He doesn't make a move without me.
It's very exciting.
277.747
# JERRY
277.825
Boy, with you two guys at the helm,
the last piece of the puzzle is in place.
281.969
279.000
**LOL**
# GEORGE
282.037
Yeah.
283.465
283.200
**LOL**
284.247
So let me ask you a question
about the tip cup...
286.506
286.583
because I had a little thing with
the calzone guy there this week.
289.767
290.378
I go to drop a buck in the tip jar...
292.517
292.588
and just as I'm about to drop it in,
he looks the other way.
295.855
296.400
**LOL**
295.925
So then, as I'm leaving,
he gives me a look like;
298.811
298.886
"Thanks for nothing."
300.610
300.900
**LOL**
300.679
You got no credit.
301.541
301.541
Exactly.
302.403
302.472
It's like I'm throwing a buck away.
304.150
304.224
I mean, if they don't notice it,
what's the point?
306.897
306.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
307.185
So you don't make a habit of
giving to the blind?
310.618
310.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
312.898
Not bills.
315.323
317.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
316.902
Remember I was telling you how Nicki
always gets whatever she wants?
320.620
320.697
We're at the movies last night,
it's sold out...
322.920
322.400
**LOL**
322.991
Nicki goes and talks
to the manager... right in.
325.416
# GEORGE
326.035
Beautiful women.
You know, they get away with murder.
328.804
327.800
**LOL**
328.871
You never see one of them
lift anything over three pounds.
332.055
332.000
**LOL**
332.124
They do what they want,
when they want.
333.932
334.001
Nobody can stop them.
335.925
# JERRY
335.925
She's like a beautiful Godzilla.
337.849
337.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
338.088
And I'm thousands of
fleeing Japanese.
341.521
342.500
**LOL**
# KRAMER
346.262
Hey.
348.153
# JERRY
348.639
What the hell is all this?
350.019
350.900
**LOL**
# KRAMER
350.599
It's my change.
352.359
352.809
I need quarters for the dryer.
355.364
355.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
357.605
Why can't you do this on your table?
360.112
# KRAMER
360.441
Because I don't have a table.
362.699
363.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
364.695
Hey.
365.824
# JERRY
365.824
Hey.
366.953
367.197
Hey, so how was
Blame It On The Rain?
370.167
# ELAINE
370.909
Hey, thanks for getting
us tickets too.
372.835
375.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
374.662
Elaine, let me ask you a question.
378.297
378.374
Was the movie part of the bet?
381.391
# ELAINE
381.460
No, we were both
in the mood for one.
384.051
# JERRY
385.338
You know, Elaine...
387.230
388.091
it's not my way to intrude on
the personal lives of close friends...
391.725
388.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
391.803
Oh, is that so?
392.517
# JERRY
392.517
Absolutely.
393.231
393.304
But I feel I must inform you
that what happened last night...
396.570
394.200
**LOL**
396.640
was more than a simple bet.
398.400
# ELAINE
398.475
What are you talking about?
399.438
# JERRY
399.438
Come on.
400.402
400.477
Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?
401.905
402.100
**LOL**
401.978
He made a bet he knew
he was gonna lose...
403.905
403.980
just to take you to dinner.
405.574
405.982
Oh, that doesn't make any sense.
407.624
# ELAINE
407.692
I mean, if he wanted to ask me out,
why didn't he just ask me?
410.709
# JERRY
410.778
If he doesn't ask you out,
he doesn't get rejected.
413.120
413.197
He's found a dating loophole.
415.918
415.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
417.909
I don't buy it.
419.254
422.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
424.165
What happened after the movie?
425.593
# ELAINE
426.125
Nothing. He walked me home.
427.933
# JERRY
428.002
To the door?
429.007
# ELAINE
429.007
Yeah.
430.011
# JERRY
430.087
That's a date.
431.240
# ELAINE
431.240
No, it's not.
432.393
431.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
432.464
But I never walk you home.
433.939
# ELAINE
434.007
That's just because
you're a jackass.
436.776
436.300
**LOL**
# KRAMER
437.802
I found a quarter. Okay.
439.646
439.721
Anybody want their clothes heated up?
441.082
# JERRY
# ELAINE
441.082
No, no, no, thanks.
442.442
442.800
**LOL**
# JERRY
445.393
How'd you leave it?
446.488
# ELAINE
446.560
I'm supposed to meet him
to pick up your cigars.
448.783
# JERRY
449.354
That's another loophole.
451.079
451.148
That's two dates
without asking you out.
453.406
451.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
453.525
You're crazy.
455.158
# JERRY
455.158
Crazy like a man.
456.791
457.400
**LOL**
# WORKER
459.655
Number 49.
461.307
# GEORGE
461.307
You know, my last name is Costanza.
462.958
463.033
That's ltalian.
464.165
464.243
So you and I are kind of like
countrymen. Paisanos.
467.961
468.300
**LOL**
# WORKER
468.038
Six fifty your change.
469.001
# GEORGE
469.001
Yes.
469.965
470.040
And I always take care of my paisanos,
so here's a little something...
473.555
473.626
Antonio!
475.055
476.200
**LOL**
# WORKER
480.049
Hey, hey, you steal my money?
482.640
# GEORGE
482.718
No, you don't understand.
I wasn't taking it out.
484.941
# WORKER
485.012
I know what you tried to do.
Get out of here.
487.104
487.180
Don't come back again, ever.
488.655
488.723
Or I break your head open like a...!
490.333
490.333
Oh, my God.
491.943
491.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
492.685
I got the calzones, Mr. Steinbrenner.
494.445
# MR. STEINBRENNER
494.520
Oh, beautiful. I'm starving, George.
496.328
# GEORGE
496.397
So I thought tomorrow
maybe we'd try a little corned beef.
500.079
# MR. STEINBRENNER
500.150
Corned beef?
502.159
502.235
I don't think so.
It's a little fatty, don't you think?
505.170
504.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
505.238
How about Chinese?
506.118
506.118
Chinese?
506.998
# MR. STEINBRENNER
507.073
No, too many containers.
Big mess. Big mess, very sloppy.
509.878
509.500
**LOL**
509.951
We're gonna stick with
the calzones from Paisano's.
512.755

I just thought it'd be nice,
a little variety.

# MR. STEINBRENNER
517.624
No, no, no.
519.053
519.126
When I find something I like,
I stick with it.
521.551
521.628
From 1973 to 1982,
I ate the exact same lunch every day.
524.183
524.255
Turkey chilli in a bowl
made out of bread.
526.182
526.257
Bread bowl. You eat the chilli,
then you eat the bowl.
528.682
528.759
Nothing more satisfying than
looking down after lunch...
531.350
531.428
and seeing just a table.
532.726
532.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
535.098
Thanks for dinner.
536.443
# TODD
536.516
I had to give you these cigars.
And since we were both hungry....
539.700
# ELAINE
539.769
Hey, Todd,
let me ask you a question.
542.786
544.857
Was this whole bet thing
just a way of asking me out?
549.369
# TODD
549.445
What?
552.555
# ELAINE
552.555
I mean, Dustin Hoffman in Star Wars?

**LOL**
# TODD
555.742
Come on.
557.715
558.619
Elaine, that was a legitimate bet.
I lost, so I bought you dinner.
561.637
# ELAINE
562.873
All right. Well, good night.
564.506
# TODD
564.506
Yeah.
566.140

If you're not doing anything Saturday
night, you wanna meet somewhere?
569.643
569.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
571.006
Now, what is that?
572.564
572.632
Is that a date?
573.977
# TODD
574.509
Why? Why can't two people
just go and do something...
576.934
575.200
**LOL**
577.011
without it being a date?
578.985
# ELAINE
579.055
All right, all right. I'm sorry.
580.862
580.931
It's not a date.
581.918
# TODD
581.918
No way.
582.905
582.975
So I'll see you Saturday?
584.336
# ELAINE
584.336
All right.
585.696

586.019
Pick you up at 8.

Must have been when
I slowed down to take that curve...

I was doing well over 100.

695.332
# JERRY

Peru?
696.885
696.952
I paid 300 bucks for these.

I could have got a house in Peru
for 300 bucks.

What's Steinbrenner gonna do
if he doesn't get his calzone?
737.076
# GEORGE
737.155
What's he gonna do?
That's exactly the point.
739.544
739.616
Nobody knows what this guy
is capable of.
741.625

He fires people like
it's a bodily function.

Why don't you get somebody else
from the office to go to Paisano's?

Before you know it,
he's having lunch with him.

maybe we could
help each other out.

something in return.

And a large soda.
831.289

And three times a week,
I shall require a cannoli.
834.633
835.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
834.868
A bit steep, don't you think?
836.593
# NEWMAN
836.662
You know, I hear that
Mr. Steinbrenner can be a bit erratic.
839.762
839.831
I'd hate to see him
when he's hungry.
