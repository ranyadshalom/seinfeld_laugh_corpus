The bus is the single
stupidest, fattest...

slowest, most despised vehicle
on the road, isn't it?

Ever notice when you get behind
a bus, people go:
9.555
9.627
"What are you doing?
Get away. Come on."
12.127
11.800
**LOL**
12.196
The back of the bus,
it's like an eclipse, isn't it?
14.787
14.866
People are just like,
"The sun. Where is the sun?"
17.366
17.400
**LOL**
17.435
It's like this huge metal ass...
19.332
19.403
just taking up the whole
windshield of your car.
23.371
20.800
**LOL**

When it pulls out, it even sounds like
a fat uncle trying to get out of a sofa.

Talk with her about how
there's nothing.

We have so many things

Me?
95.792

"Deeply in love."
108.985

You can't say something bad
about relationships...
111.458
111.529
you shouldn't say anything at all.
113.688

# JERRY
# GEORGE
117.668
I didn't know

"Could use a good laugh."

# GEORGE
124.542
I'm not good in these situations.

Oh, stop it.
131.897
# GEORGE
131.897
Also, I'm afraid...
132.845
132.917
that people in that state are finally
gonna tell me what they really think.
136.680

They got nothing to lose.

162.480
Mickey's a stand-in
for an 8-year-old kid...
164.673
164.749
and I stand in for the kid's father.
166.817
# MICKEY
166.884
But I got a big problem.
168.281
168.352
The kid I stand in for, he's growing.
170.352
170.421
He was 4 feet last month.
172.250
172.323
Now he's like 4'2" and a half.
174.152
174.225
He shot up 2 and a half inches.
176.259
176.327
I can do 4'2 ", 4'3" is a stretch.
179.885
180.400
**LOL**
179.964
Any higher,
I'm gonna be out on my ass...
182.032

but his stupid mother's
always hanging around.

195.400
**LOL**
195.146
She won't let him have any.
196.611

First you crack, then you chuckle.

First you crack, then you chuckle.

264.100
**LOL**
263.581
You know, because Leningrad...
265.171
265.249
when the Nazis attacked,
it wasn't a very happy time.
268.443
268.519
Because of the war.

332.483
What?
333.233
# DAPHNE
333.233
Yeah.
333.982
334.051
He said you could never make
a commitment...
336.551
336.620
and you'd just wind up hurting me.
339.348
# GEORGE
339.590
He said that?
341.521
342.093
What a nerve.

when I may have reacted...
358.198
358.275
in an impulsive

522.172
So he picks up
the two pieces of pizza and...
525.901
526.300
**LOL**
525.976
And they're steaming hot.
527.407
527.478
They're burning his hands,
so he's juggling.
529.671
529.747
He's throwing them in the air.
531.280
531.348
And just as he gets up to her,
down they go.
534.884
535.085
Well, we all just lost it.
536.618
537.700
**LOL**
538.922
It was really, really funny.

Hey, how you doing, Fulton?
551.525
551.602
Octane, butane, night train!

555.500
**LOL**
555.572
How's he doing?
557.419
# JERRY
557.419
He could use a couple laughs.
559.267
559.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
560.444
You should've told the story
about Pachyderm dropping the pizza.
564.742
# JERRY
564.815
I told it. Yeah.
566.246
# GEORGE
566.317
Yeah.

# JERRY
570.354
Hey, you know what?
As I was leaving, I saw Phil Tatola.
573.150
573.223
He is one of the greatest guys.
575.587
# ELAINE
575.659
Do I know him?
576.971
# JERRY
576.971
No. But of all the guys I know...
578.284
578.362
I could envision you
going out with him.
580.953
# ELAINE
581.031
If you were a woman,
would you go out with him?
584.191
# JERRY
584.268
If I was a woman, I'd be at the dock
waiting for the fleet to come in.
587.860
588.200
**LOL**
# ELAINE
588.305
Yeah, I bet you would.
All right, give him my number.
590.896
# JERRY
590.974
All right.
592.473
# GEORGE
592.543
This, you're not gonna believe.

595.346
Al Nechy, that pimple...
598.472
598.300
**LOL**
598.916
tells Daphne... Now, get this.
601.143
601.218
Not to get involved with me.
602.979
# JERRY
603.053
What?
604.115
# GEORGE
604.115
Yeah. That's what she told me.
605.178
# ELAINE
605.255
Why?
607.068
# GEORGE
607.068
He's afraid that she's gonna get hurt.
608.882
# ELAINE
608.959
Is she?
609.840
# GEORGE
609.840
Of course.
610.720
611.500
**LOL**
# ELAINE
612.830
So?
614.609
# GEORGE
614.609
What? He doesn't have to tell her.
616.388
617.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
616.700
Maybe he likes her.
618.582
# GEORGE
618.582
Oh, no, no. He's deeply in love.
620.463
620.537
I was about to break up with her
when she told me.
623.003
623.200
**LOL**
# JERRY
623.073
So, what are you gonna do?
624.608
# GEORGE
624.608
I can't break up with her now.
626.142
627.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
626.510
Why?
628.341
# GEORGE
628.341
Because he said I was going to.
630.171
# ELAINE
630.247
So now you're gonna keep
going out with her for spite?
633.748
631.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
633.817
Yes. I am.
635.698
635.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
635.698
Yeah, I could see that.
637.580
# GEORGE
637.654
I don't see any way around it.
638.716
# JERRY
638.716
Me either.
639.779
# GEORGE
639.857
What choice do I have?
640.840

Fulton's wife told me
it's all my fault.

She said since my visit,
he's taken a turn for the worse.

Did you tell him the Pachyderm story?

Yeah, I told him the Pachyderm story.
673.589
673.400
**LOL**
# KRAMER

# KRAMER
676.793
I'm very good with sick people.
678.328

They love me.

**LOL**
679.997
When my friend
Len Nickidimo had gout...
682.065
682.132
I was in his hospital room
for three days.
684.393

He knows I'm heightening.
704.712
704.500
**LOL**
705.856
This never would've happened
if you didn't push me to get those.
709.016

He's always been jealous of me.
745.751
745.829
I always got to stand in
for the bigger stars.

757.139
# MICKEY
757.207
You don't understand.
758.569
758.642
There's an unwritten code
about this.
760.937
761.011
I could be ostracized.
762.840
763.347
I remember when I was a kid,
some guy tried to heighten.
766.780
766.850
He lost his job,
lost his friends, everything.
771.284
771.355
I knew I was crazy to try
this kind of thing...
773.719
773.790
but I was so desperate.
776.518
776.800
**LOL**
776.827
What is this kid taking, anyway?
778.758
778.829
Hormones? Steroids?
780.453
780.531
Would you tell me?

792.900
**LOL**
792.376
and have breakfast
and spend the morning together...
796.276
796.346
go for a long walk,
maybe do a little shopping...
800.348
800.417

Why not?
807.904
# GEORGE
807.904
Yeah, I really should go home.
809.251

Actually, I'm planning on spending
the day with my father.
812.190
812.262
We're...
813.693
813.764
We're going to a father-son picnic,
just the two of us.

Well, Dad's been planning this
for such a long time.
823.169
823.240
He bought a new blanket.
824.671
824.741
And he got that game with the foam
paddles and the Velcro ball.
828.902
825.500

**LOL**
# DAPHNE
829.646

834.651
Yes. Oh, yes. Very much.

# GEORGE
840.123
No, no, I do. You know, it's just...
842.088
# DAPHNE
842.159
Maybe Al Nechy was right. Maybe
I shouldn't have gotten involved.

No, he's not right.
848.062

All right, I'm canceling
the father-son picnic.
854.696
854.400

I don't know what he's gonna do
with all that potato salad.

860.978
So then Pachyderm picks up
the two pieces of pizza.
865.572
864.200
**LOL**
865.649
And mind you, now,
they're burning hot.
868.684
868.752
He can barely hold them.
870.979
871.100
**LOL**
871.054
He's trying to, like, juggle the pizza.
873.918
873.991

And then they go flying...

And one lands on her face,
and the other lands on his face.

Don't touch me.
1218.097

You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.
1220.600
1220.670
All the progress we've made

# MICKEY
1225.475
Wait a second. Wait a second.
You got me all wrong.
1228.100

It was all because of the kid.
1230.269
1230.347
The kid was growing.
1232.108
1232.182
He shot up 2 and a half inches
in a month.

done the same.

You got no right.

1243.326
I'm Mickey Abbot.

I stood in for Punky Brewster
when all of you was nothing.

1248.500
**LOL**
1249.833
It's all his fault.

that I've never been with a guy...
1317.522
1317.600
who was so committed to commit.
1319.895
1319.969
I mean, it's so rare
in men these days...
1322.299
1322.372
and that's what makes this
all the more difficult.
