I've never been any place there
was absolutely no coffee.
4.636
2.900
**LOL**
4.648
And people constantly try
to give you coffee.
6.740
6.817
"Who's having coffee?
Can I get you some coffee?"
9.917
8.500
**LOL**
9.986
Coffee's one of the only things
you can have...
12.209
12.280
that people continue
to try and give it to you.
14.953
14.000
**LOL**
15.115
Waitresses ask, "Can I fill it up?
Can I warm it up? Can I top it off?"
18.501
18.500
**LOL**
18.577
You could lift up a manhole cover;
20.219
20.287
"We just made a fresh pot.
Would you like some?"
22.924
22.700
**LOL**
25.499
It has taken over humanity.
26.880
26.959
There are coffee machines
we have to call "mister."
30.309
33.715
"Coffee anyone?"
"Hey, that's Mr. Coffee to you."
37.432

# ELAINE
46.851
I'm really sorry, George.
49.157
49.228
I wasn't jealous of you.
It was just the whole marriage thing.
53.456
# GEORGE
53.523
You know, I was just
a little surprised.
55.450
# JERRY
55.525
Why would anyone eat canned fruit?
58.377
58.900
**LOL**
58.444
I mean, can anybody answer that?
60.952
# GEORGE
61.030
What about all the "loser" stuff?
62.746
# ELAINE
62.746
I don't know where the rabbi got that.
64.463
64.533
You know, I never said that.
I said, "I've never seen you looser."
69.793
69.900
**LOL**
# JERRY
70.538
I could see the can
if you're in the Army.
72.796
72.873
But fresh fruit, it's available.
It's there.
75.891
75.959
It's two aisles over.
78.052

# KRAMER

So my friend and l,
we were going to the movies...

# JACKIE
102.649
Is that ltalian coffee?
103.719
# KRAMER
103.719
Yeah, that's right.
104.788
# JACKIE
104.859
Half milk, half coffee?
106.012
# KRAMER
106.012
Yeah.
107.165

107.695
You take a sip?
109.097
109.400
**LOL**
# KRAMER
109.097
Yes, I did.
110.499
# JACKIE
110.573
When you did,
did you notice it was hot?
112.416
112.700
**LOL**
112.491
Could you sip it
in your normal fashion?
114.334
# KRAMER
114.618
No, I wasn't able to sip it
in my normal fashion.
117.422
# JACKIE
117.620
All right, all right.
119.547
119.500
**LOL**
120.039
You take big sips?
121.337
# KRAMER
121.957
Well, I think I take a normal sip.
123.800
# JACKIE
123.876
Okay, you take normal sips.
Nothing wrong with that.
126.597
126.670
Then what happened?
128.006
# KRAMER
128.006
Well, you know...
129.343
129.422
they don't allow outside drinks
in the movie theatre...
132.855
132.925
so I had to put it in my shirt
and sneak it in.
135.267
# JACKIE
135.344
Yeah, see, they like
to sell their own coffee.
137.851
137.000
**LOL**
# KRAMER
137.929
Is that gonna be a problem?
139.142
139.142
Yeah, it's a problem.
140.354
# JACKIE
140.432
It'll be a problem for them.
141.907
141.900
**LOL**
141.975
It's a clear violation of
your rights as a consumer.
144.363
144.435
An infringement
on your constitutional rights.
146.527
146.604
It's outrageous,
egregious, preposterous.
149.657
149.400
**LOL**
# KRAMER
150.023
It's definitely preposterous.
152.199
# JACKIE
152.275
So then what happened?
154.035
# KRAMER
154.110
Well, I was trying to get to my seat,
and I had to step over someone...
158.788
155.600
**LOL**
158.864
and I kind of got pushed,
and it spilled on me.
161.289
# JACKIE
161.366
Was there a top on it?
162.495
# KRAMER
162.495
Yeah.
163.624
# JACKIE
163.702
Did you put the top on,
or did they put it on for you?
166.375
165.000
**LOL**
# KRAMER
166.454
They put the top on.
167.666
# JACKIE
167.666
And they made the top.
168.879
168.956
You didn't make the top, did you?

**LOL**
# JACKIE
173.418
Suzy, I want you to go down

We're gonna run

Have you been to the doctor?
184.264
# KRAMER
184.264

The security guard.
239.686
# SUSAN
239.686
What about him?
240.857
# GEORGE
241.185
Why does he have to stand?
242.660
244.600
**LOL**
# SUSAN
244.146
Because he's a security guard.
246.404
# GEORGE
246.481
I mean, look at him.
247.909
247.982
He's gotta be on his feet like that
all day? I mean, that's brutal.

252.619
# SUSAN
252.619
George, you just met him.
254.127

Aren't you concerned
about the security guard?

Not really.

I'll tell you how it's looking.

299.485
My lawyer says if there's
one coffee drinker on that jury...

302.321
I'm gonna be a rich man.

Oh, that's despicable.
306.962

How does he know
how all coffee drinkers will vote?
309.671
309.744
I'm a coffee drinker. If I was on
that jury, I wouldn't give you a nickel.
313.426
# KRAMER
313.497
Well, you wouldn't be on that jury.
He would've weeded you out.

Frankly, I'm surprised

Suing a company

Let me ask you something.
469.724
469.798
When you're in a store,
does it bother you...
471.890
471.967
that they make the security guard
stand there all day?
474.771
474.900
**LOL**
# JERRY

No.

Are you sensing anything
right now?

490.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
491.900
Let me just say this.
493.198
493.277
It's inhumane to make a man stand
on his feet...
495.701
495.779
in one spot for eight hours a day.
497.871
497.947
Why shouldn't he have a chair?
500.004
# JERRY
500.157
What about criminal activity?
He's gotta be alert.
503.092
# GEORGE
503.160
He can't jump out of the chair?
How long does that take?
505.798
505.871
Look at this. Here, watch.

512.418
Maybe they offered him a chair
and he turned it down.
514.925
# GEORGE
515.004
Would you get out of here.
Who's gonna turn down a chair?
517.641
517.714
I'd be very interested to know
how he felt about all this.
520.649
520.717
Maybe I'll have a talk with him.
521.953
# JERRY
521.953
I know you will.
523.189
523.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
523.261
Hey, hey. Listen to this.
525.353
525.429
Jackie just called.
526.351
# GEORGE
526.351
Who?
527.272
# JERRY
527.348
His lawyer.
528.293
# KRAMER
528.293
Java World wants to settle.
529.239
# JERRY
529.308
What?
530.170
# KRAMER
530.170
Yeah, I'm gonna be rich.
531.032
532.100
**LOL**
# JERRY
531.643
Why are they settling?
533.169
# KRAMER
533.169
They're afraid of bad publicity.
534.696
# JERRY
534.771
All this because
you spilled coffee on yourself?
536.993
# KRAMER
537.064
Yeah, that's right.
539.240
# GEORGE
540.234
I'm gonna need a coffee here!
Very hot! Boiling!
544.117
542.300
**LOL**
544.946
And then, about four years ago...
547.584
547.657
I was on holiday in Tuscany,
and I fell in love with this house.
553.047
553.120
Are you ready to order?
555.046
555.789
Gosh, what are you getting, Bob?
557.383
559.700
**LOL**
560.835
Good question.
We'll need a few minutes.
563.805
563.879
Thanks.
565.852
565.700
**LOL**
567.465
You know, I'm sorry, but....
570.186
570.718
I didn't mention it earlier, but,
actually, I prefer to be called Maestro.
576.025
577.800
**LOL**
577.307
Excuse me?
579.356
579.356
Well, you know, I am a conductor.
581.404
581.644
Yeah. So?
583.322
583.396
I suppose it's okay for Leonard
Bernstein to be called Maestro...
587.160
584.000
**LOL**
587.232
because he conducted
the New York Philharmonic.
589.704
589.776
So he gets to be called Maestro
and I don't.
592.414
593.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
595.489
Well, don't you think
that he was probably called Maestro...
598.756
598.826
while he was conducting.
Not in social situations.
601.760
601.828
I mean, his friends
probably just called him Lenny.
604.170
604.247
I happen to know for a fact that he was
called Maestro in social situations.
609.055
605.800
**LOL**
609.126
I once saw him in a bar,
and somebody said;
611.265
611.336
"Hello, Maestro, how about a beer?"
Okay? So that's a fact.
615.350
615.800
**LOL**
616.591
Maestro, huh?
618.849
619.719
Okay.
621.610
621.887
Maestro.
623.565
624.300
**LOL**
632.980
Jerry! Jerry!
635.535
633.900
**LOL**
638.600
**LOL**
638.276
Jerry, my burn, it's gone, look.
641.293
# JERRY
641.904
What do you mean?
643.057
# KRAMER
643.057
I put that Chinese balm on it.
644.210
644.281
Look, it healed it.
645.369
# JERRY
645.369
So?
646.457
# KRAMER
646.533
So my lawsuit. I'm finished.
649.206
# JERRY
649.286
I thought they wanted to settle.
650.937
# KRAMER
650.937
What happens if they wanna see it?
652.588
# JERRY
653.289
Then you're in a lot of trouble.
654.502
# KRAMER
654.502
Yeah!

679.645
How come no chair?
681.951
# GUARD
682.815
What?
684.492
683.900
**LOL**
# GEORGE
684.566
I couldn't help but notice
that you don't have a chair.
687.750
# GUARD
687.819
I don't need a chair.
689.155
689.100
**LOL**
# GEORGE
689.155
I didn't mean to imply you did.
690.492
690.571
You're obviously
a very well-proportioned individual.
693.672
694.300
**LOL**
695.033
What I was just wondering is...
697.541
698.078
have they ever
offered you a chair?
700.170
# GUARD
700.371
No.
701.774
701.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
701.774
Would you like a chair?
703.176
# GUARD
703.249
I suppose if they gave me one
I'd sit down.
705.471
706.300
**LOL**
# GEORGE
706.335
You would, wouldn't you?
707.680
# GUARD
707.753
Obviously I'd rather sit,
if that's what you're asking.
710.522
# GEORGE
710.588
That's exactly my point.
711.699
# GUARD
711.699
Who wouldn't?
712.811
713.400
**LOL**
# GEORGE
713.382
Because, I tell you, frankly...
715.142
715.217
I'd like to walk in here one day
and find you sitting down.
719.065
719.137
That would give me
a lot of pleasure.
722.238
722.557
Call me crazy.
723.985

# JACKIE
726.269
You put the balm on?
Who told you to put the balm on?
728.693
728.771
I didn't tell you to.
Why'd you put the balm on?
731.196
729.900
**LOL**
731.273
You haven't even been
to the doctor.
732.997
733.066
Let a doctor put a balm on.

I guess I screwed up, huh, Jackie?

You're damn right, you screwed up.
739.168
739.400
**LOL**
739.238
Where'd you get
that damn balm anyway?
741.046
# KRAMER
741.115
The Maestro.
742.078
# JACKIE
742.078
The who?
743.041
743.600
**LOL**
743.116
What you talking about, Maestro?
744.452
# KRAMER
744.452
My friend's a conductor.
745.789
# JACKIE
746.327
So a maestro tells you
to put a balm on, and you do it?
749.132
# KRAMER
749.205
Well, my stomach was burning.
751.048
# JACKIE
751.123
I'll tell you what this is.
It's a public humiliation.
753.631
# KRAMER
753.709
I didn't know the balm would work.
755.466
# JACKIE
755.466
Do you know what a balm is?
757.224
757.500
**LOL**
757.295
You ever seen a balm?
Didn't you read the instructions?
760.230
# KRAMER
# JACKIE
760.298
No one can tell what a balm's
gonna do. They're unpredictable.
764.016
762.800

# KRAMER
764.969
All right, I'm sorry, Jackie.

Did you know that Mozart died
while writing the "Requiem"?

Yeah. Everyone knows that.
It was in Amadeus.

# ELAINE

Really?
782.416
# JERRY
782.525
What about the name?
Did he make you call him Maestro?
785.033
# ELAINE
785.111
Yeah, I called him Maestro.
786.240
# JERRY
786.240
You didn't mind?

# ELAINE
787.571
Well, I did at first,
but, actually, I kind of got used to it.
791.336

Okay, from now on, I want you
to call me Jerry the Great.
794.081

I'm not calling you Jerry the Great.
795.728

Why not? You call him Maestro.
797.296
# ELAINE
797.371
He is a maestro.
798.399
# JERRY
798.399
Well, I'm great.
799.428
# ELAINE
799.498
So you say.
801.804

# JERRY
802.334
What about his house in Tuscany?
He mention that?
804.592
# ELAINE
804.669
Yeah. I'm invited.
806.927
# JERRY
807.005
When I told him it was beautiful there,
out of the clear blue sky, he says;
810.769
810.841
"There's nothing to rent," as if
he doesn't want anyone else there.
814.274
# ELAINE
814.344
Why?
815.689
# JERRY
815.762
Maybe he's embarrassed
by Americans.
817.653
# ELAINE
817.722
Well, maybe there aren't
any houses to rent there.
820.028

In all of Tuscany? I wonder.

how severe the burns are?

All right, we'll start with 50,000

We're prepared to offer you

"I'll take it"? "I'll take it"?
Who told you to take it?

Did I tell you to take it?
887.662
887.800
**LOL**
# KRAMER
887.662
No.
888.459

Free coffee?
893.506
# KRAMER
893.579
Yeah.
894.543
# JACKIE
894.543
I don't want free coffee.
895.506
895.581
It's not hard to get coffee.
I can get it myself.
897.803

I wanna know
what came after that "plus."

But are you telling me there's not
one house to rent in all of Tuscany?
949.340
# MAESTRO

The houses are passed down
from generation to generation.
952.389
952.463
It's very hard.
954.354
# JERRY
954.423
I can't get a sublet,

I wish I could figure out if this guy's
trying to keep me out of Tuscany.

Of course he is. There's got
to be houses for rent in Tuscany.
1014.148

Do you know how big Tuscany is?
1015.502
# JERRY
1015.502
I have no idea.
1016.780
# GEORGE
1016.852
It's huge.
It's probably like North Dakota.

1019.646
Oh, no way it's that big.

All right.
1031.582

So I spoke to the security guard.
1035.162
# JERRY
1035.162
Yeah? And?
1036.457
# GEORGE
1036.535
It was tough to get a good read...
1038.177
1038.245
but I think if I brought him
a chair, he'd sit.
1041.678
1041.400
**LOL**
# JERRY
1041.957
So you're gonna get him a chair?
1043.631
# GEORGE
1043.631
Yeah. It's a question of what kind.
1045.306
1045.376
Thinking about a barstool.
1046.695
# JERRY
1046.695
That'd give him some height.
1048.014
1048.087
Be able to check things out.
With a back or without?
1050.808
# GEORGE
1050.881
I think I'd go for the back.
1052.261
# JERRY
1052.341
Swivel?
1053.470
# GEORGE
1053.470
I suppose he could swivel.
1054.599
1055.300
**LOL**
1056.844
Maybe one of those director's chairs.
1058.495
# JERRY
1058.495
That's kind of a pompous look.
1060.147
1061.600

My parents had a kitchen chair
that would've been perfect.
1065.570
