See every morning, when you wake up,
it's like you're born all over again.
5.501
3.300
**LOL**
5.526
You ever have that feeling?
Becuase You can't see, you can't talk.
8.696
8.400
**LOL**
8.767
You're on your way to the bathroom
trying to remember, "How do I walk?"
12.070
12.200
**LOL**
12.145
Like you've never
been alive before.
13.822
13.896
But if any invention marks
the decline of human civilization...
16.783
16.857
it would have to be
the snooze alarm.
18.748
18.500
**LOL**
18.817
The snooze alarm
is based on the idea...
20.660
20.735
that when the alarm goes off,
you are not getting up.
23.705
23.800
**LOL**
23.779
You're not even awake,
you're already a failure.
26.416
26.489
They should sell the snooze alarm
with an unemployment application...
29.625
29.700
and a bottle of tequila.
31.128
30.700
**LOL**
31.202
Just make it a complete
pathetic-loser kit.

Oh, God.

58.556
Hot date last night?
60.231
# ELAINE
60.231
I wish.
61.906
# JAMES
61.976
A woman with a sexy voice
like yours...
63.783
63.852
it's hard to believe
you're waking up alone.
66.703

# GEORGE
82.909
The wake-up guy asked you out?
84.752
# ELAINE
84.827
Yeah, I've never seen him...
86.125
86.203
but I feel like we have
this weirdly intimate relationship.
89.636
89.706
You know, I mean, I'm lying in bed.
92.047
92.124
I'm wearing my nightie.

**LOL**
# JERRY
94.168
I don't know. A blind date?
95.643
# ELAINE
96.128
You wanna go out with
my cousin Holly. You've never met her.
98.979
# JERRY
99.047
Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.
100.806
# ELAINE
100.881
At least I've spoken to my guy.
102.606
102.674
You're going out on a deaf date.
105.099
104.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
105.176
I think I'd rather go on a deaf date
than a blind date.
107.731
107.803
The question is, would you rather
date the blind or the deaf?
110.987
# ELAINE
# GEORGE
111.056
Now, you're off on a topic.
112.167
# JERRY
112.167
That's interesting.
113.278
113.100
**LOL**
113.349
See, now, I think
I would rather date the deaf.
116.569
# ELAINE
116.644
Because I think the blind...
117.988
# JERRY
118.061
would probably be
a little messy around the house.
120.652
120.600
**LOL**
120.730
I mean, let's face it,
they're not gonna get all the crumbs.
124.033
124.108
You're constantly
walking around with a sponge.
126.330
126.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
127.235
See, I disagree.
I would rather date the blind.
129.742
129.821
You know, you could let the house go,
you let yourself go.
133.538
133.400
**LOL**
134.074
A good-looking blind woman...
135.502
135.575
doesn't know
you're not good enough for her.
137.833
# ELAINE
137.910
I think she'd figure it out
soon enough.
140.335
140.100
**LOL**
# ELAINE
142.456
What?
144.133
144.207
What is this?
145.849
# JERRY
145.917
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.
148.685
# ELAINE
148.752
Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit?
What are you turning into?
151.853
# JERRY
151.921
A healthy person.
154.061
153.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
156.091
You squirted me.
157.286
# JERRY
157.286
Oh, sorry.

Boy, that stings.

# WILHELM

George, have you seen Morgan?
166.105
# GEORGE
166.433
No.
167.586
# WILHELM
167.586
He's been coming in later and later.
168.739
168.810
Is there something wrong?
170.752
# GEORGE
170.752
No, not that I know of.
172.693
172.900
**LOL**
# WILHELM
173.772
Really?
175.496
175.565
Well, make sure he signs this.
176.993
177.066
George, if there's a problem
with Morgan, you can tell me.
179.953
# GEORGE
180.027
Morgan? No, he's doing a great job.
182.700
182.800
**LOL**
# WILHELM
183.321
I understand.
184.880
# JERRY
187.574
I still can't believe
you're going out on a blind date.
190.082
# ELAINE
190.160
I'm not worried.
He sounds like he's good-looking.
192.667
# JERRY
193.454
You're going by sound?
What are we, whales?
196.507
196.400
**LOL**
# ELAINE
197.499
I think I can tell.
198.844
# JERRY
198.917
What percentage of people
are good-looking?
201.175
# ELAINE
201.252
Twenty-five percent.
202.613
# JERRY
202.613
Twenty-five percent?
203.973
204.046
No way. It's like 4 to 6 percent.
206.683
206.500
**LOL**
206.756
It's a 20-1 shot.
208.231
# ELAINE
208.299
You're way off.
209.203
# JERRY
209.203
Way off?
210.107
210.176
You been to the Motor Vehicle Bureau?
It's a leper colony down there.
213.975
213.800
**LOL**
# ELAINE
214.679
So basically, what you're saying...
216.736
216.806
is 95 percent of the population
is undateable?
219.313
# JERRY
219.391
Undateable.
221.199
220.900
**LOL**
# ELAINE
221.268
Then how are all these people
getting together?
223.407
# JERRY
223.478
Alcohol.
225.155
225.000
**LOL**
# ELAINE
225.521
What is your problem?
226.866
# GEORGE
228.065
No problem here.
230.204
# ELAINE
230.275
You keep winking at me.
That's really obnoxious.
232.746
232.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
233.444
I had no idea.
234.971
# ELAINE
234.971
Right there. You just did it again.
236.497
235.700
**LOL**
# GEORGE
237.155
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
238.535
238.615
It's from that grapefruit
Jerry squirted at me.
240.873
# ELAINE
240.950
Oh, your eye still hurts?
242.425
# GEORGE
242.493
Yeah, yeah, you must have squirted
a piece of pulp in it too.
246.210
246.000
**LOL**
# JERRY
246.287
Pulp couldn't make it
across the table.
248.095
# GEORGE
248.164
Pulp can move, baby.
250.470
250.000
**LOL**
250.874
Why can't you eat a real breakfast?
252.552
# JERRY
252.626
I eat healthy. If I have to take out
an eye, that's the breaks.
255.560
255.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
256.504
Wait a minute. I must have
been winking down at the office.
259.224
259.298
That's why Mr. Wilhelm
was acting so misterioso.
261.853
# ELAINE
263.009
What did he think,
you were flirting with him?
266.062
266.200
**LOL**

266.887
No, he thought I was hiding
something about Morgan.

280.455
280.856
Is this Don Mattingly's signature?
282.027
# GEORGE
282.027
Yeah.
283.198
# KRAMER
283.275
And Buck Showalter's?
284.619
# GEORGE
284.693
It's an interoffice envelope. It gets
passed around all over the office.
288.208
# KRAMER
288.279
Hey, can I show this
to my buddy Stubs?
290.122
290.197
He runs a sports-memorabilia store.
291.874
291.948
He'll pay top-dollar
for pro autographs.
293.791
# GEORGE
294.450
Yeah, like I'm gonna risk my job
with the New York Yankees...
297.385
297.453
to make a few extra bucks.
299.130
# KRAMER
299.204
No, of course not.
300.714
302.400
**LOL**
# KRAMER
303.874
No, you see, Don Mattingly
signed this envelope.
306.465
307.100
**LOL**
306.543
Then he sent it to room 318...
308.516
308.586
where it was received and signed for
by manager Buck Showalter.
312.101
# STEINBRENNER
312.172
I don't know. An envelope?
314.348
314.424
It doesn't really cut it.
315.370
# KRAMER
315.370
Why?
316.315
# STEINBRENNER
316.634
And what is this?
318.442
318.511
A birthday card.
320.650
320.721
Signed by the entire
Yankee organization?
324.236
323.800

325.766
This could be worth something.

Mr. Steinbrenner's birthday card.

for me to sign.

Oh, yeah. I'll have that for you
right after lunch.

Grandma Mema?

# MORGAN

I had to cancel it. For some reason
my wife got it into her head...

463.250
that it was more
than just a massage.

Really?

496.415
# JERRY
496.484
Well, maybe his dogs heard about
how you tried to kidnap that other dog.
500.663

# JERRY
509.456
Well, what do you mean, "Kind of"?
510.709
# ELAINE
511.538
I mean, she thought it was
kind of strange to just order a salad.
515.717
516.041
You know, for a man.
519.759
519.500
**LOL**
520.837

What is this?
564.707
# KRAMER
564.707
Your cut of the loot.
565.920
565.997
Stubs gave me $200...
567.342
567.415
for the autographed birthday card
that was inside.
569.922

You did.

That was the grapefruit.
It's like acid.

I need that card back.
It's Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.

She only used them
on special occasions.

643.569
643.641
Yeah, well, Bobby,
what if I told you...
646.030
646.102
that a very important person
at the New York Yankees...
648.739
648.812
needed this card back?

Oh, no. I'd never part with this card
for anything in the world.

659.388
# BOBBY
659.388
Paul O'Neill.
660.707
# KRAMER
660.780
What if I get Paul O'Neill
to hit a home run just for you?
663.916
# BOBBY
663.991
Really? Paul O'Neill would do that?
665.707
664.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
665.707
For you, he would.
667.424
# BOBBY

Could he hit two home runs?

# KRAMER
669.412
Two?
671.006
670.700
**LOL**
671.080
Sure, kid. But then you gotta promise
you'll do something for me.
674.180
# BOBBY
674.249
I know. Get out of this bed one day
and walk again.
677.433
# KRAMER

Yeah, that would be nice,
but I just need the card.

What about this candelabra?
686.269

That was Grandma Mema's also.

She bought it on her trip to Europe

Jerry, I'm thrilled you like my mutton.

on this mutton.

That is so funny.
Did you just make that up?
702.118
# JERRY
702.187
I wish I could take credit for it.
703.947
704.022
It's actually a line my butcher uses
when we're chewing the fat.
707.870
707.600

How about that beautiful desk
over there?

It's cold out, okay?

734.500
**LOL**
735.047
God forbid I should
borrow one from Holly.

You heard her. She coveted them.
772.502

I had to get off the street.

They were?

No, it's not that.
It's about a boy in the hospital.

do something to lift his spirits.

Yeah, what? No good?
986.331
986.331
No, it's no good. It's terrible.

You don't hit home runs like that.

It's hard to hit home runs.
Where did you get two from?

That's ridiculous.

Well, Babe Ruth did it.
997.715
997.715
He did not.

998.921
You're saying
that Babe Ruth was a liar?
1000.847

stupid enough to promise two.
1004.272

the ball rolling back to the wall.
1123.901
1123.977
O'Neill heading for third.
1125.024
# KRAMER
1125.024
Come on!
1126.070
# TV
1126.146
O'Neill rounds third,
being waved in.
1129.032
# KRAMER
1129.107
Yeah! Go! Go!
1130.451
# TV
1130.524
And Martinez throws it
over Alomar's head.
1134.206
1134.277
O'Neill is safe at home,
the Yankees take the lead.
1137.792
# KRAMER
1138.614
Inside-the-park home run!
1140.587
1139.800
**LOL**
# BOBBY
1141.199
Yes, he did it.
1142.495
# KRAMER
1142.495
All right.
1143.790
1143.868
Yeah, well,
I guess I'll be on my way.
1145.628
# TV
1145.703
Now, that's being scored
a triple for Paul O'Neill...
1148.922
1148.997
with a throwing error
charged to Martinez.
1152.512
# BOBBY
1152.583
Hey.
1153.928
# KRAMER
# BOBBY
1154.001
That's not a home run.
1155.643
# KRAMER
1155.711
Well, maybe not technically, but...
1157.353
1156.900
**LOL**
# BOBBY
1157.420
You said he would hit
two home runs.
1159.394
# KRAMER
1159.464
Come on, Bobby.
Bobby, that's just as good.
1162.137
# BOBBY
1162.216
Well, you're not taking that card.
1163.825
# KRAMER
1163.825
Now, Bobby, Bobby. We had a deal.
1165.435
1165.510
Come on, give me that.
1167.982
1167.500
**LOL**
# HOLLY
1168.054
So is the chop
the way you like it?
1170.823
# JERRY
1170.889
I usually like mine
with an angioplasty.
1173.147

# ELAINE
1181.564
Something really stinks to high...
1183.657
1183.733
Holly.
1185.825
1185.901
What are you doing here?
1187.246
1186.600
**LOL**
# JERRY
1187.319
What everyone does here.
Cooking pork chops.
1189.495

**LOL**
# ELAINE
1190.155
Listen, I'm meeting James here.
1192.412
1192.490
He's bringing over your jacket.
1194.167
# HOLLY
1194.241
And what about the napkins?
1195.227
1195.227
Oh, God.
1196.214
# ELAINE
1196.284
I didn't take your napkins.
1198.175
# HOLLY
1198.244
Then who did?
1199.438
# ELAINE
1199.438
Ask Jerry.
1200.632
# JERRY
1200.704
Hey, we can argue all night
over who took the napkins.
1203.176
1201.700
**LOL**
1203.248
The point is, in today's modern world,
it just doesn't seem relevant.
1207.427
1207.500
**LOL**
# WILHELM
1208.377
I still wanna know what happened
to that birthday card.
1211.181
1211.254
Now, Morgan, did you ever sign it?
1213.053
# MORGAN
1213.053
No, sir. George never gave it to me.
1214.853
# GEORGE
1214.924
That's right. I didn't.
1216.269
1216.342
I take full responsibility
for the card not being here, l...
1219.146
1219.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
1219.219
I got it.
1220.372
# WILHELM
1220.372
What's this?
1221.525
# KRAMER
1221.596
Oh, it's a birthday card. Yeah.
1224.780
# KRAMER
1225.557
George, by the way,
tomorrow night...
1227.282
1227.350
Paul O'Neill has to catch
a fly ball in his hat.
1230.155
1231.600
**LOL**
# WILHELM
1231.645
George, this is beautiful.
1234.318
1234.398
Why didn't you tell me
you were gonna have it mounted?
1236.869
1235.600
**LOL**
# KRAMER
1236.941
Yeah, you were probably
just gonna stick it in an envelope.
1239.876
1240.300
**LOL**
# WILHELM
1242.779
George, keep up the good work.
1245.714
# MORGAN
1247.199
Well, you screwed me again,
Costanza.
1250.300
1250.300
**LOL**
1250.369
How am I supposed
to sign the card now, huh?
1252.342
1252.412
It's already under glass.
1253.887
1254.700
**LOL**
# ELAINE
1257.124
Hi, James. Oh, this is...
1258.718
# HOLLY
1259.125
Excuse me.
What are those dogs wearing?
1261.894
1260.600
**LOL**
# JAMES
1261.961
Oh, bandanas. Aren't they cute?
1264.468
1264.700
**LOL**
# HOLLY
1264.546
You gave Mema's napkins
to some dogs?
1266.971
# JERRY
1267.340
Hey, what happened to my jacket?
1268.899
# JAMES
1268.966
Oh, the dogs did that,
but it wasn't their fault.
1271.391
1271.468
Somebody stuffed
some strange meat in the pockets.
1273.857
# HOLLY
1273.929
Was it mutton?
1275.331
# JAMES
1275.331
Could have been.
1276.733
1276.700
**LOL**
# HOLLY
1276.806
You always stuff
meat in your pockets?
1278.982
# JERRY
1280.976
Sometimes I use the sofa.
1283.566
1283.600
**LOL**
# GEORGE
1287.856
You wanted to see me?
1289.331
# STEINBRENNER
1289.399
Yes, George.
Please, come in, come in.
1291.373
# STEINBRENNER
1291.442
Thanks for the card. I loved it.
It made me feel good.
1293.914
1293.986
Word has it you were
the brains behind the thing.
1296.244
# GEORGE
1296.321
No, no, not just me.
The whole organization.
1298.959
1299.032
Especially Mr. Morgan.
1300.377
1300.900
**LOL**
# STEINBRENNER
1300.450
Morgan, Morgan. You know,
his name is absent from this card.
1303.218
1303.285
Like he went out of his way
not to sign it.
1305.258
# GEORGE
1305.328
Oh, no, Morgan is a good man, sir.
1307.171
1306.100
**LOL**
# STEINBRENNER
1307.247
You can stop.
Congratulations, you've got his job.
1309.588
# GEORGE
1309.999
Well, thank you, sir. You know,
I'm not quite sure I'm right for it.
1313.265
1311.000
**LOL**
# STEINBRENNER
1313.335
It's done, George.
He's out, you're in.
1315.178
# STEINBRENNER
1315.253
It's a lot more work.
1316.008
# GEORGE
1316.008
I know.
1316.763
# STEINBRENNER
1316.837
A lot more responsibility.
1318.431
1318.505
Long, long hours.
1319.409
# GEORGE
1319.409
I know.
1320.313
# STEINBRENNER
1320.382
Not much more money.
1322.024
1322.500
**LOL**
1322.092
But you'll finally
get the recognition you deserve.
1324.764
# GEORGE
1324.844
That's what I'm afraid of.
1326.224
1326.800
**LOL**
1326.303
You know, Mr. Steinbrenner...
1327.601
# STEINBRENNER
1327.679
George, as painful as it is, I've had
to let a few people go over the years.
