The other thing I love is when
you're in the middle of a dream...
3.994
4.018
and your alarm goes off, you
incorporate the sound into the dream...
8.828
9.100
**LOL**
8.906
so you can keep sleeping.
10.631
10.700
And you'll make any adjustment
in the dream to do it.

I was with Marie Antoinette
in a dream last night.
16.293

**LOL**
16.373
And she was on the guillotine,
the blade came down...
18.845
18.800
**LOL**
18.917
her head fell in the basket,
rolled over...
21.010
21.086
and she started singing
Neil Diamond's "Solitary Man."
24.769
25.800
**LOL**

And I thought,
"That is not my alarm going off.

The cleaner's? How did it get there?
544.904

Well, I borrowed it last night...
546.621

Somehow I dozed off
and woke up in a pile of garbage.

Somehow? You've had an hour
and 20 minutes sleep in three days.
557.378

557.450
Well, so look, the cleaner's said
you could pick it up tonight at 6.

All right. I just hope I can get it
to the Friars before the show.

I heard every word you said.
983.244
983.697
And I know you wouldn't be
just having fun with his handicap.
986.502

That kind of cruelty
would be grounds for dismissal.

I think she drugged me. But she's
a murderer, and I'm calling the cops.
1084.276
1084.346
Why would she try and kill you?
1085.857
